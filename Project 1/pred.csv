I77zZlSdCFAClxdjHwPcxw,5,"OMG! I'm an avid spray tanner and have been all over the Valley and without a doubt, this was the BEST spray tan I've ever had. Alanna was amazing! Very professional and absolutely knows what she's doing. I seriously received at least 10 compliments on my tan, from both spray tan experts and haters. The color was a gorgeous golden, sun-kissed brown without any hint of orange. Plus, unlike all my past tans, Alanna's got the blending technique down -- I didn't have a single streak or blotch. Got my tan on a Wednesday afternoon and was tan for a solid week with mild exfoliating after day 4. As someone who battles skin cancer, Sungun is my new best friend and will be a part of my regular summertime routine! Highly recommend."
ioFNKarf29KGjRZdH0qC8Q,5,Sets the standard. Authentic. Outstanding. Could eat it every day. Awesome service. Down home southern food. No compromises. Never change but you need a larger place. Thank you for properly spicy southern cuisine!
9429anmcYIcaEcMptJCNKQ,1,"Came on 7/23/2014 with a group of 10 - service was awful and the food was worse - the only saving grace was that the prices are cheap - and I suppose that's because you get what you pay for!

I ordered the tandoori wings and a side of nan - I never got the nan - it was delivered to the other end of the table and I never saw any of that. Everyone else got their orders but me - I waited 10 more - long - minutes before my 8 little tandoori wings arrived, only to find that they were dried out and so hot with curry that I could only eat one. I was extremely dissappointed to say the least.

My daughter who had her 6 week old baby with her - asked for a small bowl of hot water to place the baby's bottle in (to warm up the milk) - and was told by our server that ""they don't have hot water here"".... Seriously? You're a freakin RESTUARANT and you DON'T HAVE HOT WATER? Finally, after realizing what a pathetic boob he was making himself look like, our waiter brought a small teacup full of warm water to our table.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand to top things off for our excursion to a Triple D rated establishment - ALL TEN OF OUR PARTY GOT SICK FROM THE FOOD WE ATE AT THE CURRY CORNER!!! Maybe they should change their name to the ""Colitis Corner"" - cramps, nausea & vomitting - I lost a day of work due to the food I ate made it impossible for me to go to my job.

This is the seond time I've gone to an establishment that had the old ""As Seen on Diners, Drive ins and Dives"" - Curry Colitis Corner is DEFINATELY A DIVE !!! Be afraid - BE VERY AFRAID !!!!!!!!!!!!"

I've gone a couple times n have never been disappointed. Best  ever."
GQBlykKyShQcNeu2ivLdSA,4,"This is my hotel of choice on the strip.  I really like the layout.  There are enough restaurants to have enough variety in dining during my traditional 2-3 night stays.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  My only gripe has to do with self-parking.  If you are a guest to the hotel and want to self park, the check-in area is not very convenient as you have to walk through the casino to check-in, then walk back through the casino to get to the elevators for the rooms.  If you valet park, then you won't run into this issue, but I like to save a few bucks and park myself.  However, the Palazzo doesn't have this problem at all.  The parking garage elevator brings you right into the check-in area.  You can also access the Palazzo parking garage from Spring Mtn Rd (exit off the 15 frwy) and avoid driving on the strip.  Palazzo and Venetian are connected and accomodations are very similar.  As I like to self-park and avoid driving on the strip, I'll probably be staying at the Palazzo."
hoVH58L6rioY_DLH9C5GtQ,5,"Been a Sadu customer for years and LOVE the service they provide. The shop is clean and Cindy is an amazing piercer who takes pride in knowing her craft. She is patient in explaining the process, even if you are a veteran piercee. And Keith is a great frontman for the shop!!! I refuse to be pierced at or buy my jewelry from any place else."
JdpYMJrc9JWgot5v5rpncQ,5,"Vi and Sau are absolutely amazing! I came into their nail salon a month ago with an unusual nail design and it came out absolutely perfect!! They're open late hours and very accommodating. 10/10 would recommend!! I mentioned that I came in a month ago because my gel is still fully intact and I am very hard on my nails so they usually only last 2 weeks, 3 tops and they look like trash by then. If my nails weren't grown out I would keep this gel on my nails still haha!"
4x9iblIM01rmZji-BGcnCA,5,Have consistently had great service at this location of Data Drs. Have visited them several times with different computers for personal and business and they haven't let me down yet on recovering my data and getting me up and running. This is the first place I think of when I need computer/tech help! Thanks Steve and Dustin!
iZmNJgnQ-FFXYxl5X_B_gA,5,If you are looking for an amazing music teacher that builds rapport with his students.  Please call Miciah.  He has been teaching both of my daughters since they were in 2nd and 3rd grade they are now going into 10th and 11th grade.  Miciah is more than just a piano teacher he is part of our family.  My daughter's play the piano beautifully and they are now at the point that they can play no matter how much time goes by - make an investment in your child's future - kids who can read and play music excel in math and playing an instrument is the only time when one's brain is using ALL of it's parts.  Both my daughter's are in and have always been in advanced placement for math.  I don't usually guarantee much but this I can hands down:)
1RaZQe46shkuGxKDgkYxxQ,1,"I will not ever be going here again, and anyone who treats their employees like dirt, by insulting them and calling them names in front customers doesn't deserve my money or anyone elses."
_Enl4TDDepK74IxWR8PTJw,3,"Nellis is a bit of a hike for me, I rarely come here,just for doctor appointments and to visit with friends.

This base however is pretty good, the A&FRC offers support for not only just deployed airmen but to unaccompanied tours as well, which was a big help to me! 

The BX here is really nice, I wish they'd ID more people though, there were a LOT of people that should have not been using the BX, but whatever. I like the furniture store, but in true AAFEES fashion, its over priced and 100$ for delivery. 

The Commisarry is great, if I didn't live closer to Creech, I would shop here more often, maybe as gas prices continue to drop, I'll shop here more often. Great prices for meat and produce. I wish they'd limit the coupons here, these coupon hoarders come through here to clear out shelves.

All in all, this base is one of the better assignments we've had, hopefully more is come!"
JSvQ48cPsZqjQr0AXhJbdQ,1,"""Ok..... bare-able.... but not good""

Been here many times... Keep trying to believe Big Bens will come thru.... Oh well

Food is still par... Absolutely nothing to write home about.

And the bar...How frustrating ..... Still charging way too much.

We truly tried, tried and tried again....   Good bye, Big Bens."
p1sclp6mvFpEdHhQzrsOBQ,5,Was able to make an appointment same day for a manicure and pedicure for my self and a friend. Everyone that works in pro nails is friendly and the salon is very well kept. My pedicure was very relaxing and Ana did an amazing job with my SNS. This will definitely be my go to place from now on!
mKlhjL9YiuQ_TYb0zoIqRQ,1,"This company has zero respect for the customer and goes out of their way to make sure you never want to purchase from them ever again.

I tried to order a Festool sander from them and it went down from there.  I was initially mislead being told that I could not pre-order a tool and that they would be getting in plenty in a month.  Little did I know that they were taking pre-orders on their 'other' web site.  It happened by luck that I found the link 3 1/2 weeks later and booked my order.  Sadly that placed me beyond the ""plenty"" that were getting shipped in November and because of the delay, I still have not got my order.  Not to say they didn't bill my credit card for a product that I have not got. (over 4 months now).

To make matters worse, their customer service is to the point of non existent.  I have tried on multiple occasions to try and get even a general date of when I will get my product that I ordered.  I keep getting told SOON.  

I found out through Festool Canada that they over booked and over sold what they were allocated.  Festool has told them fulfillement amounts and when product will be shipped out to them, but sadly Atlas will not pass that on to the customer.  I don't know where I stand in their queue for product so I am just left in the dark.  

The management is condescending if you try and talk with them.  I'd not trust them to sell me anything as if this is an indication of how they opperate, you might as well throw your cash into a garbage can and light it on fire.  You will get far more enjoyment out of the pretty colours than trying to deal with these jerks."
F6uRrmarriFaDXphu41Q8w,2,"Remind me to order the Pork Belly Bun, over and over again. Order it in SPADES. Because everything else here is lackluster..."
r8I6VqTR-wL-38w9LmtZ9w,3,"Hotel Room: We stayed in a Queen Suite (two beds and a pullout) and loved the room. It was spacious and had 2 showers and 2 sinks in the one bathroom. However, there are very few outlets in the room. The few that are available hardly work. The lighting near the sofa is incredibly dark. The water pressure in the shower wasn't great. No lotion or body gel provided. No available space in the mini fridge and ridiculous fees for moving items. 

Location: It's at the end of the Strip so most places aren't walkable. You can easily access New York, New York and Excalibur. 

Club & Pool Party: LOVE Hakkasan and LOVE Wet Republic. Both have a great younger crowd and are very popular. 

General Hotel: Food court is ehh... overpriced and not too many options. Casinos are good (I'm biased because I won money). KA Cirque show is here and its baaaaaad. Don't waste your money."
kWLspfCKJrAmz7OY_uicsA,5,"I can't believe I am reviewing a post office but here's the thing...the two women here, as long as you are nice to them, and have your shhhtufff together, are absolutely incredible (you know you're going to the post office, so unless it's some crazy special handling resource, or extra fancy signature required, there is no reason you can't be a good functioning human adult to allow these ladies to do their job quickly and effectively)...rant and PSA over... Must shout out Crystal as well, as she so nice and always recognizes me. and lets me buy a stamp or two HAHA

But there is usually always a line, especially during peak hours. I just visited yesterday around 3:00 which I didn't think was too peak, and with it being the holiday shipping season, there were still just 2 of them there. They need the support during the holiday season."
a60R9UU3PHa8uGAUURXSeg,4,"The biggest problem that I can point out about this place is that EVERYTHING IS SO TASTY AND GOOD that you do not know whether to keep eating sushi or switch to the barbecue.

I went to have dinner with a group of friends and we were amazed by how tasty and good the meat and fish were (it is also fun to cook things by yourself directly on the table), but then came the sushi and wow it was so good too! Make sure you try the crunchy avocado one and the dynamite rolls - if I could I would have eaten a 1000 of those."
avsmCuCJs2Usluhyq-f15w,4,"Saku is one of those gems where u can get good value for your money's worth. The quality of the food is there and the rolls are pretty big. I highly recommend the special rolls. I came here on a Saturday night around 9pm as a group of 3. We got the creamy korokke ($6), chicken karaage ($11), Atlantic Queen ($13), ocean dream ($13), and the spicy scallop roll ($7). My favorite would have to be the Atlantic Queen which is a baked specialty roll (seared salmon, creamy crab, avocado, cucumber, tobiko). The chicken karaage here is also really good. It was juicy and tender and fried very well. It comes with a nice mayo. Service was good and the waitress refilled our water when needed. I will definitely be coming back again."
dANtIR7nqTU9BnlfvkQZLg,5,"They just did a fabulous job ! They did the base boards and fans ! Even left the nice carpet lines from the vacuum ! Wiped everything ! Very quick and efficient! I will be using them again ! They are polite and respectful! They also got me in same day I called ! Thank you lady's very much ! 

12/11 
I just had them clean my house again ! They  do such great work! Go above and beyond normal cleaners ! I have a 3 bedroom 4 bath and they finished in 3 hours ! And the quality of the work is perfect! I will continue to use them! Thank you so much guys !"
ISx7iM1WXZrO9VNxCLLiUA,5,"Love Amy and this salon. The girls are friendly, the place is clean and Amy makes sure I always get exactly what I want for my nails. I highly recommend this place to everyone I know. Thank you again."
5EwFiXT12ZSwZygFI0bhgw,5,Another great Starbucks. Thank goodness there are so many in Las Vegas and everywhere else. Always consistent and a place I can count on. Kind of makes me feel like home to get a Starbucks and know I'm getting something I'll like.
C7CXY-TLxj8Md0JcqLbJhQ,4,"More than what I expect from a Vegas buffet. It's definitely better than most. Food quality is excellent. I especially enjoyed the prime rib and other meat dishes such as the lamb. Beer and wine is also included which is a huge plus. Desserts are also very good.

I'm not a big fan of the layout of the place. It does remind me of a cafeteria. However, this is not a deciding factor for me."
zy9pK9ValWgEq3iM5kCuTg,1,"Wanted this experience to be great.  I knew the former owner of Joe's, and decided to support the restaurant while we were in Las Vegas for a convention with our employees. The short of it was that our food was pretty good, but the service was abrupt and bordering on rude. The maitre d' showed us to our table and just threw the menus out. The waiter took our orders quickly as if he had much better things to do. I ordered a glass of rose then a bottle of wine for the table. The waiter basically poured a glass of white wine into my not yet finished rose glass and when I pointed it out, he had nothing to say.  

Won't be going back."
tVzgzguKFn2wbyCUrTLxOQ,5,This is the BEST hair salon!  My hair stylist was Reiko and she was incredible!  She listened to what I wanted and gave me great recommendations.  I love her and I love my hair!  She is so friendly and personable.  I highly recommend this salon.  All of the employees in the salon seemed very professional and the salon was very clean.  All of the customers that left the salon seemed extremely happy.  I am so happy with my hair and I have been receiving so many compliments.  Thank you Reiko!!!
3ajrOxmf310bQTlyu6Dmow,2,"food was good, but service and atmosphere is much to be desired!!
Cold and noisey, not very friendly waitress/hostess and never enough ice in your water"
vo4SGfuexjCgkkBU7aymmw,5,"I had my garage door repaired and serviced today with Garage Doors for Less and was very pleased with the experience. Adrian was very prompt in returning my call and had good insight into the issue with my door. He gave me a quick quote on the effort and actual price was spot on. CT the technician was on time for the appointment and quickly resolved the issue within 30 minutes. Overall, a very good experience and the Yelp coupon kept the price in line with the average garage door cost."
_YQISRlzRHJaPJZA9YsShg,2,"I'm actually disappointed to be writing this, but it's not worth going here unless your a super foodie or unless it's for the beer. The beer was great, but our waitress, was not super attentive. When we ordered she was surprised that we weren't adding bacon onto our dish, and was obviously just in it for tips with the conversation she tried to carry. When we first sat down as well we were handed three menus and once we saw it, it was very uppity and ""substitutions are politely declined"", my husband and I were both disappointed with the service and the menu (menu because there wasn't something for everyone)."
T3o0uJ6VAbBdTcv1WmH5lA,5,"Went back to Super Summer Theatre for our first time in years and loved it! Truly a treat and just a great evening. Terrific performance. Affordable. Fun.  Great scenery. We'll be back very soon. In fact, we plan to purchase tickets in advance for the entire season, since I hear some of the shows sell out. Next time we'll probably rent chairs there for $1 each rather than bringing our own."
5pZFsfRMkQdVyabMg9mBVA,3,"Greasy & great take out food if you're looking to splurge. First bites of burrito was soooo good, but then the heavy big squashed potatoes and 1/2 burrito did it for me. Blah. Felt bloated. BFFs said her french toast sweetness was good the first bites. Great hangover food but if you're wanting to eat healthy & light, dont get what we got. Or go elsewhere."
fk22hzP1XaDFYVQtdgDiuw,5,"Delicious. Quick. Cheap. 

I feel like Ramen Hashi isn't very well known yet. Which means that the prices haven't been hiked up compared to other places and there's hardly ever a line. Very easy to be In and out if you need a quick delicious meal."
sDh669RuFID_fh3pfeFOjQ,1,"Dr. Kelly England was very controlling and rude. Our questions were regarded as threatening I guess. For one example, my son was uncomfortable with a procedure and when I asked her why she needed to do it she made no attempt to be reassuring or give any information, she just said, ""it is my job!"" I supported my son and asked her not to do it, so she said I need to find another doctor. 

In addition we had to wait in the lobby for 40 minutes and it was an hour total before we saw Dr. Kelly England. I have definitely experienced medical office staff that was far more professional and friendly than this office too. The office we went to was1450 South Dobson Road, Suite B220.

I canceled my other kids' appointments and we will never go back!"
7MP1uCTOeqXtrM-yJ3V6Kg,5,"Such a great place! We came across it by accident and are so glad we did! Our group had the buffalo chicken wrap, boneless wings, 'The Hangover', cheese pizza, chicken BBQ nachos, and fried mozzarella. Everything was delicious and the servings were perfect."
DCbPR8NBz38L_SIgY1jjbg,1,Several times I have received quotes from this dealer and I felt that I was being severely over-charged. This last time I received a quote to replace the EVAP purge valve. The total was $230 but I was told I could get a discounted price of $190. I wound up doing it myself. The part cost me $55 and it took 5 minutes. I will not let this dealer service department work on my vehicle again.
kJLu0xaENyozx2JEM5vEAw,1,"WORST experience i've ever had with a delivery compay. I was supposed to get a package delivererd between 11:30 and 3:30 on the specified date. The package never showed up between this time frame so I called and explained the situation where I was promised that it would show up before 7:00. The online status never changed and continued say it was on time and will be delivered by the end of the day. I took the day off work and not only that, the package was a gift for a wedding out of town which is why I confirmed the arrival date so many times. I will never use UPS again EVER!!!!!"
R9q_-7--inON7dr9h33q-Q,5,"We had a bachelorette party here of 8 girls. The hotel staff was really great and accommodating. Rooms were fine. Lots of mirrors everywhere for all of us putting our ho outfits on and vegas makeup at the same time.

We got a cabana one day at the pool which was amazing! Highly recommended. Pool was fun with a live dj. It was a weird mix of a crowd- babies, children and the regular Bach/bachelorette groups. 

Taxis easy to get and when we called housekeeping and the bellhop they were a,ways helpful."
pqt2a0jOd2B7NjnCmUBhog,1,"Visited Burger's Priest with the GF one sunny Sunday afternoon. We were unable to make a family BBQ which left us craving burgers.

The first thing you will notice upon entering Burger's Priest is their religious theme menu with selections such as ""High Priest"" and ""The Vatican."" Hopefully the second thing you will notice is that they only accept cash. One of the other patrons in line caught without cash, like us, asked the staff whether they knew it was the year 2016. Why do they only accept cash? I can think of a few reasons but do not want to speculate however considering the prices I found it ridiculous.

Returning to Burger's Priest with cash in hand we both ordered the ""High Priest"" with fries and a drink.

**Disclaimer** if you enjoy such restaurants as Holy Chuck you may wish to take the rest of this review with a grain of salt.

The ""High Priest"" is Burger's Priest version of the Big Mac. An interesting concept because the Big Mac costs roughly $4-5 dollars while the High Priest cost $10. I question whether a ""high end"" burger joint should be trying to replicate the taste of McDonalds. Why would I not just go to McDonald's and pay significantly less money?

The burger meat itself is where I hoped there would be a significant difference. Unfortunately, just like Holy Chuck, I found the beef extremely greasy and soft, basically mushy. I don't care how high grade, organic or fresh the meat is. It is borderline inedible, mushy and excessively greasy. 

Our two ""Big Mac"" combos cost us approximately 34 dollars. Insane. I cannot see the allure of this place and will not visit again."
ZCO8HYjl-Gg6KDRWAFJ7GQ,5,"King of Prussia, Marilyn Monroll, and the calamari / jalapeño App were awesome!  Great spot for Saturday night date night :-)"
K0ea_C3v8I26h_BeqDEgYw,1,"This place is a real disappointment.  Rooms suck, AC broken, room service during daylight hours?  Who the fuck in this town eats then.  No after hours Service.  The only thing good is the bars.  Odds are lousy, won't let you win more than $40.  Next time going somewhere else. Place is over 20 years old and needs a facelift.  Still advertising Titantic artifacts. Didn't that movie come out in 1997.  ???  The display is lame anyways. Some broken dishes and a left-over lift vest??  Who died wearing that. Appalling they even display it, let alone make money off it.  Better yet, they should provide free booze to stay here."
JP9nuAGxBDVumI_v4FZ9qw,5,"I've dined at other Mario Batali restaurants and B&B did not disappoint. During the break during his conference, my husband kept me company here for lunch (he already ate). 

I ordered the orecchiette with spicy sausage and rapini and it was simple yet delicious. The pasta was cooked al dente, the spicy sausage gave it a perfect kick, and the portion was a good size for lunch -- I wasn't overly stuffed but I felt full by the end of our meal. Even though the restaurant was busy, my dish came out quickly.

The service was friendly and quick. We were able to sit on the patio area so we could people watch. I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas to try other dishes here."
EhvpZ1-MzemK1EMBUf19gQ,5,"I came here for my 40th .First of they offer free limo service to and from which was really cool.  When we first arrived we were greeted by the manager he walked us up to the top floor where the male review was and told us we had the choice of seats wherever we wanted.  We were also given two drink coupons per person so we ordered a drink and got seated. The show started off slowly but what I really liked is the guys came out to sit and talk to you, also they were really cool about taking pictures. By the end of the night it was so crowded but it was amazing had the best time I definitely will be back. I hope soon."
V1_y3toVJn44WYpsKJCfXg,4,"This charming bakery has gelato, coffee, and great baked goods. I had the half ice cream sandwich, with a peanut butter cookie and chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. My wife had chocolate and raspberry gelato and my friend had an ice cream cone with banana red pudding ice cream. They all were great. 

I also had a cappuccino and although I'm not a coffee specialist both the women with me assured me it was very good. 

The only critique I have of the place is that it does not have enough seating. There is only one table inside (we got it) and benches outside. On a nice day it's not bad, but even then you can't sit around and talk easily. So it's a small place, but so what, check it out and get a treat."
5fyFfoRzwod7pQbHERuscw,5,We had a great night here. Ioana was an awesome bartender. Her cocktails were amazing and service was spectacular! Ask for her when you go in!!
h4iKDWTGao24S0P0-6FiDg,4,"We stayed here over Valentine's Day weekend for a little staycation. It was our first time here and it was a very enjoyable experience. Upon entering the resort and driving to the lodge/front desk, you get to see the natural beauty that the Boulders have to offer. Most of the units don't have parking, so you valet or self park (both are covered in the resort fee) at the lodge and then they drive you in a golf cart to where you're staying. There's nothing bad to say about this, as all you do when you need a ride to anywhere on the resort or back to you vehicle is use the phone in your room and they are there to pick you up. I believe the longest wait was around 5 minutes. 

The casita and pretty much all areas of the resort are very nice and clean. The only negative I have to write about that keeps from a 5 star review is:

Lodge pool - the pool entrance was a big turn off, as there were many dead bugs, dirt and some kind of oil/film that covered the top. 

Romance package - the food and drink vouchers were nice, but the sparkling wine really just made me laugh. It was a twist off cap and can be bought at the store for $5.99. While the presentation was nice and who doesn't like having a bottle waiting on ice when you get to your room, it'd be better to bring your own. For a resort of this caliber, I expected slightly better

Poolside service - there were about 15 or so people poolside, but only one waitress, whom also was helping inside. We arrived and waited close to an hour before we received our drinks. Waited to be acknowledged, waited for the waitress to find and menu, and then after ordering was about another 20 to receive them.

Overall, was a very good experience and we will probably be back again, but hopefully will have a 5 star stay"
e03TLm7X3Zc7XZtQeRuBEg,3,"The interior is really beautifully designed, the staff is pretty nice, and the food is great.  I do think it's a bit more expensive than it should be... but that's pretty much standard in Vegas.  I have eaten here twice now, and the first time they gave me grief for taking a photo in it so it can't be a 5 star (they wanted me to buy a photo of the interior... come on people you SURVIVE on tourism)."
xe18fSt6RalVY_2LwLmGiA,4,Love the lazy river and the cleanliness of the rooms ! Love the food and entertainment at the House of Blues but the hostess at the front on sat at 8pm on 5-27-17 was rude not like our waitress that was super sweet and made sure we where well taken care of !
NKb6Laz5wj4xyz8U1p5sww,5,"Best Pizza in Streetsville, Meadowvale area. Only problem is its a take-out and they are very busy. Love their potato pizza ""skinner"". The dough is traditional and cooked in a wood fired brick oven and not oily at all. Must try brick bread. The website does not say its a take-out only and also does not indicate they deliver, but they do."
frYWD5bbfqysVVXNeAZFdQ,5,"Wow!!  Amazing food - super fresh - everyone in our party loved it.  We order the Mexican chili as an app - super tasty.  I has the pulled chicken burrito, which was out of this world.  Will DEFINITELY go back next time I'm in Vegas"
OEytne2IN8Ut9gMcmy0Nxg,4,Cosmo park is great and a good idea for Gilbert. We use to take our dog Gidget there all the time but she gets to nervous around other dogs and it was causing he lots of stress. But the facilities are nice. Especially now that they have a timid dog area. The only downfall is lots of the dog owners are borderline retarded and don't watch their dogs to make sure they behave which has caused problems almost everytime we have gone. But overall a great place to take your pooch.
gaRT7S86kjp33QXJPcTtgA,1,Lost all my dollars and the House of Blues Restaurant was terrible.  DON't Bother going there.
vFn4CJhF_VWkYV9rb2UQag,5,Excellent South Indian dining and among the best Indian restos in Montreal. This is one place that knows what perfection when it comes down to creating their dishes. Definitely a place worth dining at!
d4Z7hH1QEGfngCXdvayFQg,4,"It's Starbucks and it's Vegas, but still no excuse to overcharge for a cup of coffee.

Usually a long line in the morning, even if they serve up cups of coffee faster than my local Starbucks. Friendly service too. 

I soon found out there was a coffee shop in THEHotel lobby, I think it was just called ""THE Coffee Shop"", that served a good cup of coffee for about a buck cheaper, just as friendly, without the long line."
g4ovWEkUfP5-qhO0SgHp3Q,3,"Good, but should have been better.
The Decour of the restaurant is beautiful, and the location is perfect right in South Park. Also, all the sides we ordered with our meal were amazing.  But there were a few things that bothered me about our meal. First the service, our server was very nice and professional. I just wish he was a little more tentative to our table. I felt like I was constantly looking for him to order a drink.  Speaking of drinks, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails that the waiter recommended. It was very good just weak.  At $15 a pop, I'd like to taste the booze in my drink. 
Now on to the steak. I ordered the bone in aged ribeye medium. The first steak that came out was chard pretty bad and lacked flavor. The manager came over and offered to cook me another one. 20 minutes later a less chard steak came out. The second steak was a lot better and had some good flavor. It was just unfortunate that we were all done eating by the time it came out.  Overall, our dining experience was good just not great. And i feel that when you go to a high end steakhouse house everything should be great.  That's why you pay $15 cocktails and $60 steaks..."
uZh5HMLOvm6AAZw5O4BvMA,4,"If you haven't tried Rosati's you are missing out! When I came here I had a meatball sub and it was the best I've had thus far. The meatballs were so tender and the bread was perfect, not too crisp or too soft to leave you with a soggy mess!

I finally brought my boyfriend here and he loved it! Call in your order ahead of time so it will be ready by the time you come or you'll have to wait 10-15 minutes. There are only counters inside and if you can bear the heat by now there are tables outside. It's not a sit down and eat place. If you're looking for authentic Italian give Rosati's a try!"
zVxvRxgWJF4iH6Wr7n6Jlw,5,"Great place for lunch downtown during the work week! Great salad bar, plenty of pre-made sandwich's/wraps, sushi, there's also a counter where they will make made-to-order sandwiches wraps and rice bowls. Always fresh food, and quick service."
5JIeaRfrYen_OhUhf_WwBA,1,"I used to love MM, but they just seem to continue to go downhill.  I took some guests out to lunch there, on a slow day when there were a total of 3 other tables there, and STILL received ""so-so"" food and service.  

First, not only did our cheese bread app take forever, but when it finally came, it was cold and dry.  And we couldn't even eat it until the waiter decided to finally bring plates and utensils.  Why this was not done right away, or anytime during the 25 minute wait, I don't know.  I actually got up to go get stuff for us to eat it with, along with salt and pepper that was also not on the table, and as I was coming back to the table, the pizzas were arriving.  WTH?  There were seriously THREE tables in the whole place...thats not even acceptible when a place is actually busy!  And if your app comes within like 3-5 minutes of your appetizer, it should be free!  

Then, we specifically ordered our pizzas with extra cheese because this place has been very light handed with it in the past.  Not only was there still not much cheese on it, but one pizza was burnt, while the other was still doughy.  Gross.  Too pricey a pizza for what you get. I'm gonna have to throw in the towel on wasting anymore time or money here."
lqKZ7CQu93s6zhedzabXtw,4,"Nice, cozy, good selection of pastries and drinks, polite staff. Non-dairy choices of latte which is awesome! We came there to warm up, and to have a quiet corner to sit at with our drinks after a long walk, and we definitely got what we came for."
rMlQztL9Ot8ayRxTeo78tA,1,"Diana Shoemaker you were my grandmothers Nurse 7-24-2017 floor 1 B room #158 , My Aunt was there all day with her and mentioned you had only been in that morning. When my boyfriend and I got there we were looking for you as to find out result from the day before and when my grandmother would be transported to the rehab. We were there for an hour before my Aunt found you in a room and asked that you come in so that we can speak to you.  When you entered the room you had a horrible attitude and talked down to us in a very condescending manner. You had said you hadn't been in yet as you just were informed as to where my Grandma Lila would be transported to. Funny as we had the name of the facility 3 hours prior to you being pulled out of your computer room. We were just waiting on you to have the papers filled out and transport team get her. You left the room and none of us knew any of my grandmothers results still and you had said at 6:30 p.m. they would be there to transport her between 6:30 and 7:30. I went to drop my daughter off at home and meet the team at the rehab. My boyfriend stayed behind with my grandmother and said they didn't show up until 8:35 P.M. he mentioned you left without saying a word. By the time my 95 year Old grandmother arrived at the rehab it was almost 10 P.M. The staff at Sante informed me that the Nurse they spoke to at Thunderbird was very rude the whole time and they never dealt with that. I asked what her name was and Ironically, they said Diana.  They also told me it's unusual for them to have a patient arrive that late. I understand that people have bad days, Clearly we have had a few bad ones our self as our Queen B is sitting in a hospital and to top it off with a nurse who could give a s&%t less about being there.  The inefficiency that we experienced with you as her nurse was mind blowing. How was our whole experience exceptional until you became her nurse? I sure hope this was an exception to the rule and you had a VERY off day.   

I also understand the hospital was very busy, However, we expect accurate communication through the staff and the patient. After all, that is your Job."
EgYnr4o3VuisBpEiuegTqA,4,"Delish! I have yet to go to an ice cream place that is as satisfying as a Ghirardelli! So when we saw it, we had to stop in! 

My husband and I shared a Lands End in a waffle bowl, which was pretty much a brownie sundae. It was plenty big to share so we are glad we didn't get anything else! The brownies were warm and gooey. YUM!"
aQVcPTkAGlCjOw78biJNQw,5,"Katsuya restaurant offers a great dinner menu for restaurant week with 4 courses at $50/person and the portions are all very generous; our server are very nice and professional. The food was very good, the chicken salad got me, it's a bomb."
GFz7L1Mm1rw434tBBZFwwQ,5,"I had a chicken salad it was so good!! I can't wait to order food from here again. The salad was fresh, plenty of meat with cheese and banana peppers."
VKuWmvvaPJzNHuJOaeWilw,4,"I ordered a double patty burger and anything that has avocado, I do tend to order.  The presentation of the burger is dramatic with a serrated knife stuck in the middle of the burger to keep it all together.  

My burger was a little big salty for my taste, but it was juicy.  I had a side salad that came with the meal and it was a decent portion with minimal fixings, but still satisfying.  I like to have a little greens with my meal and they did a great job with the salad too.

The plating and presentation is dramatic and served in big portions."
kp-XHErt-9aZIK1OqBDZEw,2,The service was terrible. I constantly had a empty cup and had to ask several times for refills and was overcharged for our meal. Sad sad sad. The food was decent but not what I expected. Alas it is what it is.
HmuKGrmqiIAqlpCfJa-qWQ,3,"I order lunch from here today and it was not awesome. I had a chicken parm sandwich and fries, which is usually a go for me when I try a new place because it is really hard to screw up.....unless you haven't changed the oil in your fryer since LENT! My sandwich and fries tasted like fish fry. The fries were soggy and greasy (which happens with old oil) and my sandwich was over cooked and chewy.
The place is actually cool and in a great location. It could be a great place, but if this sandwich is any indication they need help. Probably an ok place to grab a drink before a show. 
On a side note:
When you order take out you have to walk to the back of the restaurant were the waitress pick up the food for the table and talk to what seems to be a cook who rings you out.....kinda wierd, this is usually done at the bar.

I will give them another shot and update my review later."
v9kO7G4R2SmZFvnhfgB0Qg,4,"Had a very enjoyable dinner that started off with a delicious Hong Kong style milk tea, Pork Lo Mein and a Wonton noodle soup as main dishes.

The best was their home made noodles, that remind me of Hong Kong.

The service was great the price was even better.
Definitely recommended. Next time I will try their dim sum.

Cons: little place and decor is minimal"
V3R-27ikOW1N2wxe9jpuww,1,"Huge disappointment. I would give it a 0 star. Ordered food and waited over 1.5 hrs for main dishes. When asked for an update on status waitress never came back to our table to provide an update. Horrible service. Food never came. We told the waiter we were going to go elsewhere for lunch.

We had 2 apps that they said they wont charge us for when asked for the bill as we were going to eat elsewhere. 

What a disappointment as the 4 of us were looking forward to it."
unIs51vO7qsMGorPviTyjw,5,"Nate truly saved the day!!

I had grown up with dogs my whole life and had just gotten my first dog on my own and expected everything to run smoothly, as it always did. My husband and I moved into a new house and my dogs behavior began to change. She became aggressive when we were outside together and even cornered me once. I felt like I had no control and was extremely anxious when I was around her, a feeling I never wanted to feel with my dog. I immediately reached out to Nate who spent a few hours with me over text talking through ways to handle the situation until we could meet up. After our first session I couldn't believe how much better I felt around my dog. We worked on simple day to day activities first like walking on a leash, and not having my arm pulled out of it socket, and how to answer the front door with and excited, anxious dog. We then moved on to the bad behaviors outside and ways to correct her. My dog has truly done a 180 thanks to Nate and has even been given compliments on how well behaved she is. I would recommend Nate to anyone especially if they are struggling with a dog, as they are suppose to bring love and excitement into a home not fear and anxiety! 

Thanks Nate for all you have done!"
SiRkkkqOicnAxcBM503Pyg,4,"Today was my first experience using uber during the day to run a few errands.  I've been in uber  cars previously but with friends using their account and I can't account for how quickly we were picked up or what the cost was.  My once old reliable car sprung a few leaks from various parts of the cooling system so it was towed to the shop and I'm stuck at home but had a doctors appointment close by so decided to give it a try.  For the trip there I had a car at my house in 3 minutes, on the trip back around 5 minutes, paid $5 each way, much better and faster option than bothering a friend for a ride.  When I finally received a call my car was fixed and ready for pickup, again had a car in 5 minutes for a cost of under $7.  I would assume rides around old town at night would not be as much of a bargain but I am pleased with today's service."
Hfefz12vNBOhNEVCzJirWw,5,"I've been watching this place waiting for it to finally open for awhile. The wait seems to have been very well worth it. The interior is nice and clean! It would appear to be a fast food restaurant at first but everything is super fresh and cooked to order plus the inside seems comfortable enough to sit in as well. 

The customer service was perfection!!! I loved the warm welcoming smile and personality of the cashier. He's awesome! 

I ordered a carne asada quesadilla that seemed unique from any others that I've had as it included lettuce. The combination of the ingredients exceeded my expectations. It may sound weird but I liked the way that it was served on a plate topped with foil lol. For some reason it made it feel and taste even more authentic!! Like bringing a to go plate from your Tia's house or something lol. I will be returning for sure and trying out more items on the menu. If you like what seems to be authentic Mexican food, this is a great place to go!!"
av2fNOSbwC8dky6B59vclw,4,"Wow is the word for this sexy Mediterranean restaurant! Felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant in LA 

The food was good too and very reasonably priced .. but just loved the ambiance and open dining area .. I'll definitely be back"
4br8qfT8Bw7njhMjp6WytQ,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Best italian in town for the price. That chicken sandwich with a nice big side of spaghetti. Oh man...just so good. Wait staff super knowledgeable and friendly. And the food...amazing!
fQngxfSG8iW5EaY1lKs7Tg,5,"Came in for an oil change and a tire balance. They called to let me know that they drove around to feel out the car and do not feel a tire balance is necessary. No other mechanic in history would have said ""you don't need this service that you are asking for"" because usually they just want to make money. I didn't get up-sold a filter, etc. like you do everywhere else when you get an oil change. Love this place."
AZQNd84q7iTq1MQ2sZMkhw,1,This damn place is freaking horrible!  How the hell do these people get a license to cut hair?  I will NEVER EVER take my sons to this place again.  This place isn't worth the damn real estate it's built on.
tgpv8uCmBlKGlg2oX2ARWg,3,"A place where 90% of the customers are seniors. They have renovated the place and you can definitely tell that it has moved up a notch in terms of class. The service was great! We asked about the complimentary salad that used to be a part of the main dish we ordered and even though we were told that they have discontinued it, and they don't even offer Parmesan cheese because (manager's quote: ""cheese price has gone up"") with pasta, they made an exception for our table and gave us free salads.
We had 3 different guys coming up to our table asking how the food is. Honestly, the food was good, but it was quite average. It can get really annoying when they keep asking the same question over and over, while you're trying to talk with your friends and eat. 

pros: free parking in the mall parking lot, good service, decent food, reasonable price 

cons: can't think of any, other than the fact that the vibe is too mellow. After all, it's located inside the most boring mall I've seen (but for others that can be a pro), Also, there's nothing on the menu that excites me enough to comment on (very average meals)."
zYkKTXXFpcmYN-BLZn-zZw,4,Great steak! Like this place better for dinner than lunch. Salads are just ok.  Cool place great service.  The baseman bar is unique
a9Mz7BJkLklIRIk-ZYX1wg,4,"So now that I've been to New England, I'm writing a more fair review. I've more respect and appreciation for Lobster ME. They've changed many things since the last time I've been here. New menu items! The freezer in front where they house their lobster ice cream is now in the back. That ice cream was the reason I fell out of love for this place.

Price-wise, it's inexpensive for the amount and quality of lobster you get on their lobster rolls...and you're saving money for not having to take a trip to New England! They'll charge you the same price for a lobster roll in New England anyway. $17 for a regular Maine-style lobster roll or $23 for large. But wait, if you're local, you get 20% off! 

The bun on the lobster roll is buttery and toasted. Generous amounts of lobster with large claws on top. From their new menu, I tried garlic fries. It was very garlicky, yum! 

And now the Benadryl is kicking in...can't write anymore. Zzz..."
Eym771X8KCkkKgTEuVbwjg,3,They have a nice display of there menu.  Came here for lunch with a friend.   The chirachi Don has Uni!! Which I've never found elsewhere.  And there were many high end sashimi in the rice.  The only con is that it was premade so the rice got a bit dry and cold.
HP6NEsv8ePTtmYqgaDZ87g,3,Nice atmosphere and reasonable prices. Food was just ok...not bad but probably won't be in a hurry to come back. Restaurant was empty but they had the check on my table before I put my for down...wierd service.
TVGaZ1nl_JI9Y21zP5YBlA,5,"An excellent Filipino restaurant that won't break the bank. I'd say their portions are very good, and the food is very tasty. I've tried the tapsilog, longsilog and lomi and all were delicious. The place is a good size, not too small or huge. Just enough for this type of food place. Highly recommend it."
nELVPMglUtA7vpOoREX_XA,4,Always get friendly fast food service here. Patio super convenient for kids and dogs.

G9dOIAnzRGt5xpL6JM85QQ,4,"I love coming down to OTB; it's my go-to place in the south side for a bite to eat.  I have to admit that I was a bit intimidated to go inside at first, even though I'm a cyclist--somehow, everyone looked so tough!  Don't be like me and let that hold you back for YEARS before heading in and trying one of their delicious burgers.  They do a nice job cooking burgers less than well done here, which is something I appreciate.  I do wish they had more than eight beers on tap (even as an IPA fan, there have been times when I have been disappointed by what's on), but their lengthy list of bottles and cans always has something to satisfy."
H2z_UkcFSYnfB3On5b3jkw,5,"Really happy I switched to this place. The staff is friendly and the salon is modern and comfortable. They also offer a lot of great products. Also, they have a lot of different ways to earn discounted services and that is a plus. I would definitely reccommend this salon and I will continue to patronize them."
yHvVB8wxfD71ivfP-OEIFQ,5,"Loved this place. I visited a place like this in Vegas. You order boiled seafood by the pound with your desired spice level (mild was spicy to me). The tables are covered with paper for easy clean up then they give you a bib, gloves & a bag of steaming hot seafood. 

We ordered the ""handful"" with large head on shrimp, clams, sausage & crawfish. Order extra potatoes & corn upfront you'll need it. I had fresh shucked oysters. I heard the crab was good too. They offer fried seafood. Prices are on point. 

The place is McDonalds casual and they just got their liquor license too. You'll enjoy it."
ViPHiO7GUGeBa6ggY0ROCA,2,Their sandwich scared me. It was way too overwhelming. i'm still contemplating if I ever want to go back....
XW4Q06Wf93-ThtXURydJWA,3,"Food was very delicious. We ordered Rib eye steak with asparagus, atlantic salmon scampi, and iceberg wedges. 3 stars is for the super slow service and we had to requests 3 times to get a simple straw. I do commend the server named Alma for her assistance on her service. She was not our waitress but next time we come back again I will personally request her to be our server."
YlUwmCCeW513xbpEhkiHoQ,5,This place is awesome for kids and adults. My sister and I took both of our kids both 4 years and they loved it at first they thought they wers real creatures but over all lots to see i didnt feel like we were there 2 hours . The prices were the best and worth it.
-0NM6uef1HjFC8CwEVDO2Q,4,"I have been a member for about a year now.  I have wasted few $$$ in the beginning in finding the right therapist for me. I had to go through 4 therapist before finding AC. 
In massage... its either you have the touch or you don't, and AC definitely has it. 

AC is always fully booked, you will have to make an appointment in advance. 

This place is newly renovated too. Lobby got a lot smaller but they add a private waiting room inside."
kaPIEgoDsqPra_Gmpv1XTg,5,"I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first since most of the pics were from the owner.  When I am on the road I always enjoy finding local places and this is one of those that when I return I definitely will be coming back.  Pittsburgh is full of local gems like Pamela's, DeLuca's and Primanti Bros to name a few and I would add this to the list.  There really are a lot of choices in the downtown area but this trip I did not have that luxury.  On my last night here I decided to finally to give in and I am glad I did.  This is hands down better than any Subway by far.  Also, for the price I got 2 nights worth of food.  The bread is probably the best selling point since it offers a light airy texture to the sandwich even though it has the appearance of being dense.  I didn't get to try the sides but the fact you have a choice is much better than any Panera Bread.  Anyway, this is must try if your in the mood for a deli sub and when I come back I will be exploring other options on the menu.  And the fact there are no pics, well it's probably because there's nothing to take a pic until you realize it's too late."
ApspQmkdMnspO4Qu8IYkwg,5,"Ok, so yes publix can be on the more expensive side - that being said I use the online app for coupons. And shop sales and it's nice. And they Still cheaper and more friendly than HT.

The publix dairy brand is impressive, they have my family's favorite yogurt & ice cream. I enjoy their fresh fruit and veggies.  And blue apron samples with easy to follow recipes and shopping lists are nice. 

Overall I love to shop at publix!"

They have several levels of wash starting at $3.  We just chose the $6 wash we just needed to get bird poop off the car. 

WOW..... probably the nicest drive thru car wash we've ever been through complete with a towel dry off at the end.

The attendant who started us off in the beginning to the  attendant  who dried off the car at the end were very professional and friendly!"
_hYAbcXPpXaXUKTV_vz0lQ,1,They failed to give me the bonus promised and wouldn't even refund me a single trade fee as a customer courtesy gesture after the hundreds of dollars of bonus I lost. They are not to be trusted!
l4_e-8oy0iRr0Kk77k-1Hw,4,"What to start with, Gilley's was alot of fun.  We ate there on more than one occasion and usually got the appetizers (Nachos and Chicken tenders).  Loved the food, a lot more than my husband and I could eat and the waitresses really took care of you even when you were just ordering drinks.  We sat out in the bar part by the mechanical bull and had great sevice even during the busy times.  

Every night they have a special theme, we really enjoyed World Famous Bikini Bull Riding.  There was a DJ and 5 girls rode the bowl and they had promotions where you could get free stuff from their sponsors.  I had a lot of fun both because of what I was drinking and the entertainment.  They have line dancing classes at certain times, you can ride the mechanical bull or just watch others partake in it.  If you want to have a seat you need to get their a little earlier than it starts or if you don't mind standing don't worry about the timing, either way you will enjoy yourselves at Gilley's.  

The waitresses are all dressed cute and they get on the dance floor at times and are very good at the line dances.  They are willing to take pictures with the customers and it makes for a great memory of your trip.  You are encouraged to wear your western wear while you are there, but not required.  

I don't have any complaints when it comes from Gilley's whether you are just looking for inexpensive food, drinks, or entertainment you can't go wrong with here.  It is located in Treasure Island on the Las Vegas Strip."
aMt1bTkLyjNGTxDZ_dtarA,1,"Avoid at all costs!  Place is dirty, the food is garbage and staff cannot be found when needed.  My Dad was there and I met several times with different department heads and the administrator,  a joke.  Every staff member I met did nothing but complain.  My poor father passed away due to the inferior care provided at this place.  Should be shut down and entire staff should have their licenses revoked permanently!"
b05hLfpPE6vcFMEoWtjGPQ,1,"Rented a car thru Hotwire and was setup with Budget Rent a Car - I compare this with playing Russian Roulette and actually getting shot.

When picking up my car at Budget, I was assisted by a supervisor named Roosevelt,  who immediately tried up-selling - which is understandable because it's his job, but he was very rude. I purchased rental insurance through Hotwire, but Roosevelt kept interjecting that i'd be personally liable for damages and that Hotwire's insurance didn't mean anything. He also kept interrupting me and telling me that I needed to purchase Budget's insurance to be covered.

Setting the up-selling aside, the car given to me was a different class/size than promised. My email confirmation from Hotwire said Budget would provide me with a Ford Fusion or similar, however Roosevelt dismissed everything and said I'd have to pay more for a Ford Fusion. In the end, I was stuck with a Chevy Cobalt that had no radio antenna. I asked the people in the garage about the missing antenna and they said they get stolen and never replaced....

It's the combination of poor service, wrong vehicle, and missing antenna that earns them a 1 star."

BARB'S BAKERY THAT IS!!!!

Happyland abounds, They have a huge assortment  of goodies at fair prices that allow you to try a variety  w/o  gouging your pocket book.
I tried a Lemon cupcake, delicious. lemony-goodness with lemon curd surprise baked right into cupcake. I love surprises in my cupcake!  
I also tried a ice cream coned shaped sugar cookie that smelled like a sugar wonderland & was so cute & delicious. The cookie's price  was worth it in  the smell alone! 
The actual cake of the cupcake here is really moist and some of the best cake I've had."
cIkxS9nbnSSq30d3VBfAiA,2,"I only give this place an extra star because the decor was awesome. All the staff I spoke with were super friendly and helpful except the guy I dealt with the morning we arrived. I had called the previous evening and told them I would be super late sometime early Sunday morning like 3-4 am. Well nobody specified if I wasn't there by 6am they give your room away. So they still charged me $180 for the first night, they did give us Sunday for $40 but that was still ridiculously expensive for only having the room one night. 
  We were super disappointed to find out our ""suite"" was really just the same amenities as a motel 6. Just a bathroom and a bed basically. For being so far off the strip and charging so much you would think the room would be unbelievably amazing! Wrong. We will never stay here again."
iJ21sawtiD7aDTvBm8D7Gw,5,Best Persian restaurant in Vegas. The food and service are amazing! Would come back if I lived in town.
FS3pSmlNDTduJ3geGjCRbw,3,"This is a pretty good burger place, but it's far from the best.

Their interesting combinations makes this place better, not the meat. I really enjoyed my Kobe burger with bacon what not, aka the Gold Standard. The bun was nice. But the meat was slightly above average. Not great, but pretty good.

The onion rings were decent too. Nothing special, but good."
VDkqBpD56edJYmsWGNIGQQ,1,Ordered take out last night for my parents . Ordered a large bacon cheese classic pizza and starter fried wings with new flavour sambala chilli. The total came to $48. My dad said the price was too expensive for a large pizza and wings. The wings came with 2 sticks of celery instead of fries.

ko10pm0dMZkQiMh-RnGHsQ,2,In the past I have enjoyed this establishment sent all my family from out of town this way but now I have seen changes have taken place that I am questioning.....The quality of food has went down. My food was pink and raw quit a different flavor that I wasn't use to.  Really sad I guess I will try Gordon Ramsay Pub I haven't heard anything but G R E A T things about it.  I certainly don't think chef Ramsay would send anything R A W out of his kitchen.  I was afraid to ask for a re-fire since I couldn't get a hold of my phantom waitress.  The only good thing was it was easy access to my car to leave.
XX1hzXG1E-g9doCUVtUWjQ,4,Flapjacks is a great family restaurant for breakfast with a laid back quiet type environment. They have various specialty pancakes which require a little bit of extra time and love before they make it to your table. If you get there during busy times then you will have to wait for table to be cleared before you can be seated.
LTujggA0VuEe-IGc_EhebQ,3,"i would have liked to get the whole pickle not just a quarter of pickle slice.  The burger was fair, possibly frozen patty?"
rR7Voso5xaHEiwc7sdmtXA,3,"In the historic setting of Mainstreet Unionville, this small cafe is a nice location for visitors to grab and go with their selection of coffees and teas.
Issue I had with this place was its not a very large space and seating were limited. Although I did enjoy the comfy chairs they have set out, the table seems to be set too low for a venue that serves cakes. Therefore while seating was picturesque, it lacked a bit of functionality. 
But I guess for place of that size it bods well that people don't linger. The Mille Crepe cake and Latte was good. Generally a nice place to visit on your own or with a friend. not for large groups."

Dr. Bramley has a lot of experience as a vet. Our breeder trust him, so we trust him completely. 

We would recommend him to other animal lovers!"
nf0VZVS2IpBp-aP-6ELyAA,5,The place is great. I got schnitzel and the size of that dish is huge. Me and my girlfriend shared one and wow definitely worth the money. Staff is great and atmosphere is very relaxing. They dim the lights making it seem romantic which my girlfriend appreciated and so did I. Overall great service and food. 5/5
qJi27gGjZPNrxU1V8Rl7Eg,3,"I like this place.  My friend knows the owner, otherwise I would never have come here.  I try to never take guns through North Las Vegas because the laws there are not gun friendly.  New Frontier Armory has a nice selection of guns and accessories.  A lot of gun shop employees are know-it-alls and straight  up jerks.  I have not had that experience at New Frontier Armory.  Their prices seem fair.  I always use them for shipping firearms.  Give them a try."

4gQeL3VVgf5rjxGP3u4QwA,3,"I am going to have to give social house 3.5 stars and here's why. When we arrived we waited outside at the valet service for 5 minutes and no one showed up to take our car. We didn't want to wait any longer so luckily we found another spot on the street. The interior of this place is breath taking and I really did appreciate the level of detail that went into building this place. The food was excellent nonetheless; however, portions are very small. I can't attest to all of their dishes being this way, but what my mother and I ordered was small. I left the restaurant still hungry. The flavor of my dish was incredible though and I could have ate more of it no doubt! My dish was the short rib yaki noodles ($16)! My mom ordered the scallop pad thai ($19) which she also really enjoyed but also agreed more noodles would have been nice. I would like to come back for a late dinner and drinks. Maybe try out their sushi options or even the ramen."
xuJF7dIBQzpsOzEATlr0IQ,3,"Great atmosphere and wonderful staff. I ordered the shrimp po boy but was extremely disappointed. Tiny piece of shrimp, bland flavor, wouldn't order it again. Because Az lacks good seafood, I am going to try once more with what they're famous for, by the pound seafood. Try this spot, just don't order the po boy."
6nz4M9pP30BGswme9h0WSA,1,This place was great until I went to the front of the store to check out and this black haired woman was rude to me for no reason. Worst woman in the store hope they fire her.
j64tP3EI4VnfmTpKOaK57w,1,"Rude barstaff, drunk customers, great for the regulars not so good for anyone else. The liquor board should shut this place down, they don't seem to realize there are serving laws in this province and when a drunken regular starts arguing with a sober patron it's the barstaffs job to remove the drunk from the premises regardless of how good of a friend they are. It's unfortunate places like this are able to fly under the radar. I guess we'll have to wait till one of these patron kills someone with their vehicle before something is done. Be careful when driving near this place, it might be you."
RorOGrkuz3hCYz2hrZaj9g,4,Great Breakfast! Could eat here every day. If ordering through Yelp just make sure you check your order as seems like it can be a little confusing to the employees for some reason.
pnyEMkrDbgdRYi7DmtAJqA,3,I just headed down to Collegiate Lunch but it's shuttered - green garbage bags carefully cover the window and glass door - looks like it's down for the count on a rapidly gendrifying strip.
1D8hb7iV5hb8-XAhxKLg9g,5,Small family shop. Tom was recommended to me by my father in law. Who was recommended to Tom by his boss. This is the kind of loyalty Tom inspires. Good honest work without all the flash. His office / waiting room is very cozy. Leather couch and bar stools. Walls covered in pictures of family and other auto decor. Free soft drinks in a fridge.
cBrK9670QR-90658TU3G3g,5,"This place rocks! A very inexpensive breakfast bar that satisfy ones adventure in finding a new twist on the first meal of the day. I landed here based on the great reviews from Yelp and as always, I am not disappointed. Today, I tried the hot chicken & honey butter French toast biscuit with a cup of latte with almond milk. If you love waffle chicken, then this dish is for you. The biscuit is flaky and light that is lightly dipped in French toast batter. In between the biscuity is a deep fried chicken breast smothered with a spicy butter that provides a little kick of spiciness. That's not all, the biscuit is perfectly coated with a honey for a sweet and spicy explosion.  Wonderfully amazing!"
mUjByKeaY_KFIx6aZn-Fag,5,"So much fun and SO much food. We had some sashimi and the crispy rice sushi to start.  Very good, very fresh and nice portions. My husband and son shared a BBQ combo of short ribs and bulgogi. They loved it! Came with all the little bowls of goodness, shumi, soup, rice, a veggie pancake and some veggies and salad. Literally too much food. I got a bibim bop, with a squeeze bottle of gochuchang on the side. So good! I haven't been this full since 2010! The service was exceptional. I tried a soju and it was pleasant but i don't have to have that again. They brought a little Korean dessert drink with the bill that tasted like iced apple pie. It was good but too full to enjoy. I can't wait to go back and pace myself a little better next time."
gLWwKE7kByMjH0DZ0k13LA,4,"The food at this Laredo's is not as good as the one on the westside of Madison. I have been into this location a handful of times and it's ok food. Not super great, not terrible. Somewhere in the middle. It has a decent bar with a nice drink/beer selection. I like the guacamole made table side. A cool way to start your meal. We had lime margaritas on the rocks and they had pretty nice balanced flavor. I love their fajita quesadilla lunch menu item. I've had it multiple times and have not been disappointed. I think I may have had a couple of dreams about it even. Love the queso on top and the edible garnish on the side. Add that sour cream and guacamole to the top of that quesadilla. Don't be shy. Just add it on top. You will be pleased you did. Slice through that layered goodness and take a bite. Delish! They have some really good combination plates too. A nice variety for your palette. I like that this one is convenient for me, but I think I would make the drive to their west side location to get a better tasting meal."
xcyWhOUjub5cQLuQy75hzA,4,"Came here for the Bradley vs Marquez fight. Im excited because this was my first ever live boxing match and my first time ever at T and M. Was all ready to pay for parking but pleasantly found out that you didn't have to. Parking was half full but we had a disabled person with us so we got to park right in front of the arena. 

Like all hyped up epic boxing matches, there are always undercards that go before the main event so that whatever drama that has been building up since its announcement can marinate in everybody's minds. 

Of course, until the main event comes around, the arena is only half full. It's like a party atmosphere until then no matter who is on the undercard. I would say about 3/4 of the crowd were Mexican pulling for Marquez. Lots of Mexican flags being waved around not the mention all the cervezas flowing.

The sound system is nice and loud especially when they play music for introductions and videos played on the big screens. The only bad thing was that when they actually spoke into the mics, it wasn't as loud and not very clear.

What makes this a 4 instead of a 5 star review is not because of the lousy mics, its because of the lousy overall design of the parking lot logistics. Earlier, we were ecstatic because we scored a disabled parking spot. Only problem was that getting out was a total nightmare. Since we were basically parked in front of the entrance of the arena, a massive amount of attendees were all over the place walking back to their car. This was probably the only time that cars did not have the right of way. You had people all over the place walking around like zombies. Yes you had parking attendees directing you where to go but it didn't matter because the people walking around didn't care if you were trying to get out of the parking lot. They just kept on walking like there were no cars at all rolling around. This definitely has to be redesigned. Im sure this is not as bad as a problem at other arenas.

Overall, I had fun up until we had to leave. Maybe next  time we we just wont park so close to the arena. Oh btw, the fight went the full 12 rounds and Bradley won by split decision."
Skwszj0aeFZxvJDFuhc12g,5,"Amazing - went for a friends bachelorette party and was blown away by the food stations, everything was so delicious! Warning though, it is very easy to fill up there so temper yourself. The meat selection was endless and again everything tasted so good. The service was impeccable, the show with the acrobatics was great. Just remember to go and relax this place is not fast food, take your time and enjoy the experience because that is exactly what this place does in a spectacular way .... Provides you with an experience"
mv2x8L6-O4zziohxnn6KCw,4,"Disclaimer: I came here first time for Summerlicious 2013 with two others.

Wow, the apps were good and the mains were amazing. The sweet and bitter salad was really great; a great mix of the two flavours. The rainbow trout melted in your mouth, and the duck confit was good as well. Flavours were not too subtle, but not too rich either; just right. Everyone was really happy with their apps and mains.

I will say that if I had to pay regular price, I wouldn't be so impressed with their desserts or drinks. I ordered a mimosa ($8) and someone ordered soft mojito ($11). They were both not very good, and the portion was really small (mimosa came in a very skinny glass, and was portioned for like, 4 small gulps), so a double whammy on both drinks. 

The desserts were also very simple; not like ""awesome because it was so simple and amazing"", but like, ""just simple and meh"". Like I said, I think this place has good appetizer and great mains, but not so much for dessert and specialty drinks.

We sat on the patio, and it was really cute; birds singing, music playing, leaves and twigs falling on to our table, which made us giggle. The bee was pretty scary, but I seriously recommend the patio.

Server was very busy, so we understood that he wasn't always there. He apologized on his own and he was very courteous. Left a great tip, because I think service at regular times would be fantastic."
E5DyQ-8AWhq0tuvKgCU1yg,5,"First time visiting the one on Central Avenue. The Croque Madame was utterly out of this world. Such a large portion with a savory blend of meat, cheese, eggs and sauce.  The person with me had the Shrimp and Grits.  He was not disappointed.  Service was quick and the server was on the mark. Definitely,  one of my new favorite breakfast places."
p8VR7t8xCouBLttAWMyoFQ,4,"This is a pretty nice movie theater that has XD sound, similar to Dolby atmos theaters but the Century version. It's a bit confusing in terms of locations as it is located in the back of the casino and up an escalator. This isn't really too terrible since you can make a nice walk through the casino and do some people watching. 

The theater itself is very nice and looks to be recently upgraded. The food court area has two sides as does the hallways featuring the individual theater rooms. Customer service at ticket pick up, entry, and the food area was satisfactory as well. 

The actual auditorium seemed a bit outdated in terms of seats as they felt almost like airplane seats with close proximity to the person in front. BUT the actual screen and sound are phenomenal which warrants a 4 star rating."
8tr26ILaUFDrl67AeROGIw,5,"The best lechon kawali!  After all these years, I still haven't found another that I would willingly inhale fast enough.  Always crispy and moist at the same tome, you can never go wrong!  This paired with garlic rice and atchara (pickled papaya) can get me to smile ear to ear afters.  Definitely my favourite stop at downtown Toronto."
OIhZZxI3RES2PI84QGT50w,1,"Horrible experience on our last visit!
We went there on a Saturday evening and checked in for three haircuts. This was around 5:10 pm. There were two ladies without their name badge on. Both had poor customer service skills but one of them was worse! Rude looks, snobbish attitude, blunt talk, not at all pleasing in personality and worse when it came to giving a haircut. She was not at all accommodating and we came out disappointed. Infact, decided not to go ahead with third haircut too. Never again with that lady."
pu95OOHKjGlJVT9HR5E8YA,4,"I love coming here to get the baby back ribs, pulled pork, collard greens, potato salad, corn bread, and fried okra.  The meat falls off the bone and is just easy to devour.  I had their chicken too and found the dark meat more desirable than the white meat.  To appreciate the white meat, I needed to dip in to the barbecue sauce, which by the way has a zing to it.  

The pulled pork sandwiches are also to die for.  I'm not normally a fan of pork, but I'll eat it here over other places that serve it."
UwJzuXrpN3pHtDmgBeEKXw,4,"Fairly new to the Las Vegas area and haven't tried nearly enough restaurants but know a lot about restaurants in general. The atmosphere is very casual and calm. Plenty of TVs in the bar area and a friendly staff. What brings me back though is a few of the menu items. Namely the Fish and Chips and their amazing Prime Rib Dip Sandwich! OMG, a must try if you are a French dip fan. The fish and chips get the same review from me, a MUST try! As far as I know almost all their menu items are homemade including their desserts, lasagna, dressings and even some awesome Italian sausage! A bit out of the way, you will feel like a foodie guide bringing people here, who otherwise  would never have known. Deans has gone through some staff in the last few years and seem to have found a great group of people who really care about giving a customer a great experience.  Overall a wonderful dining experience!"
kuN9FI2NtLigw8g-vKid8Q,5,"1st time... it was PACKED.....and I must admit, I was concerned that it would impact the service...BUT the service was exemplary and the food was fabulous!  I will definitely be back and recommend it to friends and family!  Thank you all for an amazing experience!"
UwANBc01orad7QtdIKyE6w,5,"We hosted a happy hour event here in the upstairs room, and it was fantastic. GM Dan couldn't have been more helpful in scoping the event for us and adjusting as our numbers changed up until the day of. Our bartender for the night, Joe, worked non-stop to make sure everyone had enough (delicious and affordable) belgians and apps and always with a smile. Great bargain, great drinks, and great people. I can't recommend them enough when you're looking for something near the convention center area."
g38vCQfohfUyzjOexrevGw,5,Great coffee and amazing pastries! Love the vibe. Always so busy and pack every time I go. I like the big tables they have there to do my studying.
y0Ia1pRVcoQk07ig1eeNEg,4,"It's right on the strip, you can watch it every half hour starting at 3pm, and it's free!  What more can you ask for?

My wife and I watched one show in its entirety for the first time ever, and it was just lovely!

TIP:  If you're going to wait for a show, go to the middle.  People, for some reason, crowd in the corner underneath the ""O"" sign.

Afterward, stroll into the hotel and check out the Botanical Gardens... also free!"
XdKswjKfVBaip8QHnRFzDA,5,5 stars for fantastic food with justified prices and amazing service. They even made waiting outside a pleasure. Go there if you have the chance! It's worth it.
oGO_wwfSEG7f_ZDk5rtVdQ,3,"UPDATE: I finally got a call back from Friendly Ford after leaving messages with the man who commented back to my post and it wasn't even the guy I left the message with. It was a nice gentleman named Frank in there customer relations department and he had no idea that this even took place. He was calling to see if I still wanted to buy my lease. There was some terrible communication going on there. 

I purchased my lease out from you guys(1/15/18). I was very happy with the terms and extended warranty that i was getting. Fast forward a week later, I get a call saying that the interest rate I agreed to and signed for was wrong and that the rate and monthly payment would go up. This is absolutely BS. If I changed my mind a week later I WOULD BE STUCK WITH MY ORIGINAL DEAL. Unless my rate goes down and I'm compensated for the BS I am being put through, I will never be a customer at Friendly Ford. It was appaling getting that phone call last night.  The worst part is that I was supposed to be contacted by the finance guy and or manager before close of business yesterday (1/20/18) but no one called me back or answered my phone call. The only one I spoke with was the sales rep Stephen who could not do anything for me but was kind and courteous"
zhvoZvmjYLQ4N_fVC05w4A,4,"This place might just be my favorite Fox Restaurant. Finally, an FRC in which the price actually seems to fit the product. The views of Camelback mountain are spectacular at sunset, and sitting outside when the weather is nice or even a bit cool is great (outdoor fireplace)! I loved the inventive cocktails, but I have to say my favorite part was the lasagna in béchamel sauce. Amazing! My honey ordered the turkey sandwich with fries. The sandwich was adequate but nothing extremely memorable. However, dipping some of his fries in the béchamel sauce was heavenly! I'm tempted just to order the fries and see if they can whip up some of the sauce for me as an app on my next visit!"

We have no knowledge of any stain incidence nor did they provide us proof (photo) of any damage rendered by us.  The manager on the phone was speaking to us cuttingly/scornfully and without any customer service regard.

1FXcob1zKBGe-31BGWjW1A,1,Horrible work. I had a deluxe pedicure and the girl rushed. My nail polish looked horrible. Then she kept stopping in the middle to do eyebrows. So I sat there waiting every time someone came in. I understand that she was by herself but she didn't have to rush me. Then got a full set by another lady and she rushed also. Never coming back. Overpaid for the work I got.
Y_23N-jNJiEL51L3pBFMQA,4,"I stopped in on Saturday clueless on what to do. I am only 12 weeks, so I didn't think I was ready for a maternity store, but my jeans are a little snug, and I didn't want to buy a new pair of regular jeans that would only last me a couple of months tops. My husband and I wandered in and were met by Lisa. She told me that anything I buy now should take me through my pregnancy, so I started grabbing jeans. She also measured me and gave me a bunch of bras to try on.

First of all, I did not know they made designer maternity jeans. The nicest pair of jeans I have is from J Crew, so I guess it took the insecurity of pregnancy bloat to push me over the edge. I also had no idea what a nursing bra was, but they had the same brand as the bras I get at Nordstrom, the only difference is they have clips and a little sling inside the cup. Otherwise, I would have never known the difference. 

Lisa was a huge help throwing me in different sizes. It was also great being able to show her the fit of the jeans and bras to get her feedback on if I needed a different size. My husband and I walked in nervous and dreading the experience, but it turned out being a lot of fun. I ended up spending a small fortune on new jeans and bras, but it was such a relief to walk out of there knowing I am covered now that the weather is getting chilly. The jeans fit so well, and the bras are so awesome, that for the first time in 12 weeks I actually feel half way like a *woman* again rather than just some weird alien baby vessel."
ej7CuqL8uf7hWNsPuAU-9Q,1,found a caterpillar in my rolled tacos. im 7 months pregnant and that was quite disquisting i almost puked. luckily i only ate one taco before i noticed it and im pretty sure i didnt eat a caterpillar thank God! GROSS. i wont return. they did give me my money back immediately and also offered to give me something else LOL no thanks! if you guys cant pay attention when making food im NOT interested in coming back!
1_XjAAItEKOEJouKWk_1Ag,2,"The only thing worthwhile about the Red Tomato restaurant is their waitress who had full blossom riped tomatoes...and a decent looking face...

Food was not good...Got crab cakes which were okay...Chicken satay were dry and not even warm...Lobster crab soup is alright...Stuffed calamari with risotto is different, but this one tasted rubbery... The mussels with leek sauce is interesting, but mussels were not tasting fresh...The ginger ale I ordered was a very small glass...All this for $65! Not a good place to dine overall..."

When someone orders food deliver what they ordered this is the 4th time I have ordered food and not rec'd what I ordered. And your fries are soggy and gross.

F2HvgaLBf2t1QLVcWxrLVQ,1,"Very very disappointed with my hair color. I am a brunette and I was expecting to lighten my hair. I specifically mentioned to my hair stylist Dee Lewis that I have to tie my hair at work and I want to lighten my hair. The color is so dark that you can't even notice if I have got any color change. It's like I never went for a hair color at all. The whole purpose of getting a hair color is to change your look and feel good about yourself. But right now I feel like I wish I had never gone to this salon and listened to the hair stylist Dee lewis. She doesn't understand the needs of a customer and frankly I found her a little snobbish and dismissive too. I wish there was a money back option. Never going to her ever in my life. Total waste of money and time. Plus, I feel so angry and frustrated. I wish I could go back in time and tried a different place instead of Evoke. The only good part of this whole waste of 200 dollars was blow dry by the sweet girl named Dasha."

I recommend the walnut chocolate cookie and the gateau basque."

ODDjzWrwABSL-LKLapSr1g,5,"This is the go-to breakfast place in Tempe. Everywhere I travel, I always search for these one-of-a-kind, owner-operated restaurants. When I found Harlow's a few years ago, I was not disappointed. Now I eat here at least once per week.

My usual is #2 Cisco which is French Toast. They also have a lot of good Mexican breakfasts. Always check the board for special, like Eggs Maximilian with chorizo. Chorizo is home made.Or Chicken-fried steak and eggs.

Portions sizes are HUGE and often it is my only meal I need for the entire day.

The cooks at Harlow's are the ultimate professionals. They manage to prepare food for dozens or hundreds of customers every day.

The wait staff is exceptional. Friendly, welcoming and always on the ball, re-filling your coffee or iced tea.

Enjoyment of life is all about simple things like finding a good breakfast place with tasty food and friendly people. You will find it at Harlow's Cafe."
uOdVOHt2IwBpWYpk_WCeYA,5,"My husband and I stop here when we go see family back in California. It's a great halfway point for us, and it's the perfect place to detox and get ready to get in the family chaos or return to reality at home. 
We love the option to use the kid area pool or the adult area pool depending on how crowded either one is. The spa in the kids area is large enough that you can sit and have a conversation with your spouse without feeling like you're sitting right on top of the people next to you (large enough for 70 people we're told). The rooms are perfect for the essentials, you have a fully functional kitchen, which is amazing. The bathrooms are spacious and the water pressure in the shower is always great (this is a big deal for me, I hate not being able to get the shampoo out of my hair or getting shot in the eye with a stray stream of water). The adult area pool has a great little bar, and the prices aren't bad. Best part of that is being able to charge it to the room so you don't have to bring your CC to the pool. Great little gym on property. Gorgeous scenery if you want to walk around. Lots of day trips available for a price. There is an actual spa attached to the resort, and I'm sure the treatments are wonderful, but I feel they are a bit pricey. 
My husband loves being able to check out bbq tools and we will usually bbq a nice steak one of the nights we are there. The people at the front desk are always very helpful and if there is an issue with your room they can usually send someone right up.
This is definitely a place we plan on spending a lot of time, and we hope to get our family to meet us halfway to share in the little oasis in the desert."
wa4KFXsn7HXjyEyszC4yww,1,"Not what to expect for a lounge/club in one of the largest hotels in Vegas. PH should invest in a much bigger venue to accommodate its guest. Staff was terrible and rude. They act like they own the place or they think its the Marquee. Wasn't impressed by the service either. Bar tenders are very very rude, well, you don't get tipped that way, or maybe I will never go back there. The place is so tiny which you feel you are running out of O2. Better yet, they have host at every corner of the casino trying to recruit people with rest band claiming a VIP treatment, once you hit the door, you find out that its all a HOAX. Bad marketing strategy."
jRUJUpoF8IyjdZSaTOgAzg,2,"I've been to this Winking Lizard a bunch of times and think its heading down hill.  The atmosphere is nice and they do have a really good patio.  However, the food and service are not very good.  Had a Patty Melt which I asked to be cooked medium and it came out as charcoal, literally nasty chunks or charcoal grinding at my teeth.  I sent it back and they bartender explained they were Flame Grilled and was pretty rude to me about it.  Also, on another recent visit I asked for my wings to be cooked well done and/or crispy but they came out barely cooked and were disgusting.  However, I was I did'nt want a run it with the bartender so I ate about 5 and left in a hurry.  I also noticed a few other patrons who sent back their food too, maybe they have a bad chef on Sundays.  

Maybe my dad is right when he calls it the stinking lizard, yes I know cheesy, but this places food really sucks.  Also, there french fries are frozen sysco brand steak fries.  

With all that said, a nice place to grab a beer(Huge Selecetion) but stick with the free popcorn!"
8_fPTXSVhcsOgC6Jtm2TPA,5,Love this place! The instructors are patient and kind especially Jamie and Scott! Love the hot room and the inviting atmosphere of the place. Super clean and nice! Make sure you're on time though- the studio is locked during class (which is also a relief to know that nobody can mess with your stuff!)
x4w6ra4ax5KVZMvwQW-Z2w,4,"This review comes a bit late but it's well deserved. I'm kicking myself because I can't remember my bartender's name. I think it was Morgan? Like I said it's been a while. So my friend and I came one early evening I think it was a Friday afternoon and it wasn't packed for the night yet of course. I'm not going to lie. I sort of judged especially it being by/on frat row. My friend and I sat at the bar and Morgan was super nice and suggested food for us. We ordered the sliders and boy were they amazing. We asked her where they would be showing the Mayweather McGreggor fight. She said right there! Of course right?! So next day rolls around and we get there super early to eat beforehand. Oh yeah food was super good. Beer, good!!! Lol. Morgan was very attentive as well as Chloe. So if you remember the Mayweather McGreggor fight took forever to start so we were literally there for hours. By that time our asses were sore from those seats at the bar. My friend and I were expecting to pay $50 to watch the fight and they didn't charge anything for females! Sweet! Pays to have a vagina! Lol. Had a fun time here with good service. Will be coming back here when I visit!"
o7K9KM9UE5_cM7oPM_vIXA,2,"Friday night at Madison's hottest new restaurant, and let me tell you like it was.  First,  it was packed, and VERY VERY noisy, I had to shout to talk to my table mates.  Second, we arrived at 6:30, can't recall when our drinks arrived (7PM?) but our first plates ($3 for 6 SMALL pieces of bread) arrived at 7:20.  The second round of plates arrived at 7:40.  Grits and an egg, which was good but strange.  The bread was long gone, so there I am eating just grits, and an egg.  The third round arrived at 8 PM.  I got the mac & cheese, which was cold; not lukewarm, COLD.   I got heartburn --- probably from drinking beer on an empty stomach and the weird parings becasue who eats grits and an egg on a Friday night and 20 minutes later cold mac & cheese?  Also got a sore throat from shouting and my clothes smelled like I had been in a cheap diner.  (But of course this place is pretty expensive, given the small portions.)  Oh, the wait staff -- there were four or five different people throughout the evening taking our order, bringing food and drinks clearing stuff away -- who is our server?  Who's service do we base our tip on?  They got orders mixed up, who get's what again now? I found it discombobulating.  Bottom line, I did not enjoy the expereince at all."
CsYgNE4nGImXNNh138tPVw,4,"You need to visit this new spot in Tremont for some great food and live music. The place is very intimate and have a small bar, a few tables and a dance floor. The decor was on point. They put a lot of thought into the music venue details, from the large graffiti wall that acts as a backdrop to the musicians, to the actual memorabilia in the bar. There was a fun band there that was rocking it out all night.  I love loud music, however, it got a little too loud at times. All part of the experience, right?! The staff was very friendly and took time to answer our questions. Perfect small bar menu of food choices. We ordered 4 different items off the menu. The beef and onion sliders were very flavorful. Chicken and waffles were awesome, however wish the waffles were a little crispier. The grilled cheese sandwich was yummy- it had spinach and was pressed in a waffle iron, and the Cheetos that came with it were extra special with some spicy flavoring. The tempura onion rings were perfectly seasoned, but wish they were a big crispier as well. The onion ring and chicken and waffles were service on drum stick planks. Cool touch. Ill definitely be back again!!"
Y1CMexEb1bynntTLNWU3Uw,1,"THE LAB IS DEAD.

All that's left is the sad remnants of their burger menu as drably interpreted by a Guatemalan restaurant using subpar ingredients and fast food execution. 

Clue #1: We were literally the only ones there during dinnertime on a Saturday.

Clue #2: More than half the place was set up as an even sadder attempt at a Latin club (see photo). Again, exactly zero people present, other than the ""DJ"" and his late middle aged companion. So our disappointing burger meal was accompanied by blasting reggaeton.

The food: The ($18) surf and turf fries were covered in cheezewiz and overnight grocery store guac, with a stingy amount of ""asada"" and 4-5 shrimps. The wings tasted straight from the freezer with salad dressing ranch. The only passable part of the meal was my El Nino burger, which was meh and looked absolutely nothing like photos from the Lab's glory days.

RIP The Lab. Let's not contort your legacy by trying to house you in a wanna be Guatemalan dance club."
bgxyhBI9TQxcbrZteoYa_w,1,"Stayed last year. Cabin dirty smelled like cigarette smoke manager gave us a free night and told us they were remodeling and to ask for cabin 8 next year. Just did it and were disappointed.  No fireplace. If you plug in the toaster you have to unplug coffee pot. The blind fell down in the bathroom and took out the toilet paper holder. They updated the furnature  to cute rustic wood log stuff but it's oversized. To go to the bathroom I had to crawl over my husband every time. The toilet ran and the sink dripped. Also they put wood floors everywhere. Not so clean and cold take slippers. You couldn't plug in the clock and the lamp at the same time in the bedroom because the outlet was bad all in all wasn't worth the 255 a night
Also the cabins back up to the road so you hear the trucks go by all night."
elWjCQMauJ6GNROEand5wg,4,"Food was amazing especially the breakfast burrito. The novelty of eating at the airport was a nice family experience. The place was really crowded and we didn't get much attention from the waitress. It was nice, however, that there were so many people that no one noticed our loud two year old."
83p_n1HcEIbfJuR1DuUC0A,5,"Recently CLOSED....out of biz...We love this place!  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Food is great.  We have been there 4 times and we only moved to Peoria 6 weeks ago!  Loved the chili relanno , pork enchiladas and V6 appetizer."
xLcq-KNxQjDoYoIuWKbMjw,3,"This place is actually a great place to study while enjoying something to eat. The food was pretty good for the price. The menu had a variety of choices which made it difficult to choose from, but the choices all seemed fairly delicious. If none of the items on the men seem appealing to you, they do have build-your-own waffles and wafflewiches. I do recommend checking out Groupon as well for other deals that are offered here. Spend more, eat more, be happy! 10/10 highly recommend."

Not only are the kids mesmerized by the tricks (they are quite amazing!) but the jokes are absolutely hilarious... for both the kids and adults alike! It's kind of like watching a Disney movie, the jokes are on two levels which makes it super-entertaining for the parents as well. if you're looking for terrific entertainment, especially for a child's birthday party, Magic on the Run is definitely a great choice. Highly recommended!"
jDqvHTYMiRmCRc0EuIbLug,3,"Due to it's small size, this McDonald's location located in the Greenwin Shopping Center at 345 Bloor Street East serves mainly the lunch crowd (mainly from Rogers) and the residents of 77 Huntley Street (the residential complex located above the shopping center).  This store lacks equipment for lattes that other McDonald's locations that have been recently remodeled now have, leaving only drip coffee as the only option for coffee lovers. Service is good and staff are friendly.  Seating space is limited due to the small size of the location.

7RmVHtHC9G_g_h4Q0CZ72w,5,"Great cupcakes, pastries, baked goods, and breads.

The workers here are super nice and the shop is clean and cute.

I wish I could have tried more stuff, but I only had the chance to try their cupcakes. They were moist and full of flavor. If you're looking for a sweet treat, make sure to come here. They are also on the outskirts of Uptown Charlotte, so parking is so much easier here."
BeSePP_5hHpfwIAspqCE1g,2,"Had a bit of time before work so I decided to give this place a try. I asked the waitress for recommendations. She told me that everything was good except the Sausage Patties. I didn't see Turkey bacon on the menu & I haven't eaten the yolk of an egg in so long and now have an intolerance for it so I ordered the Skinny Omelet, sub Goat Cheese for Parmesan. The omelet was mediocre. Looked like something I could make at home. And they just kind of threw some parmesan cheese on top instead of cooking it into the omelet or even inside the fold. Also i couldnt find a single Garlic Clove. No effort at all. I saw some other omelets that I'd like to try on the menu but the little omelet I got today came to $12 & wasn't even that great. I think I'll stick to the Omelets at The Flying Biscuit in this area for now."
9_Dd5hC6ALBU20yM7g6Csw,5,"By far, the best pizza spot in the area. Been coming here for a while since they opened up about 2 years ago or so, and they never disappoint me.
They simply have salads, pizzas and pasta.
Have only tried their salads and pizzas so far,
Portions are very generous when it comes to salads, but if you're not into gourmet dishes then this might not be a good fit.
My favourite is their chicken pesto pizza, in my opinion their best on the menu.

Very small place though, can take up to 25 ppl maybe at max, 4 or 5 smaller tables with like 3 or chairs each. It's a cool modern little place setup, with their Tomato sauces, pop bottles, flower all stacked up facing the dining area."
v-F7zOzQnltVQW1KdzGE_A,4,"I kept meaning to leave this place a review! Anyways, about a month ago I tagged along with my bf for a business trip and he had told me that the hotel room was at The Rio. After yelping it I was immediately hesitant bc of their reviews... ""Oh no! This is going to be horrible! Someone even mentioned their room was by the outside dumpster!"" As soon as we got in, (after making our way to the hotel elevators   strategically placed on the other end of the casino) I was pleasantly surprised! The room was great! Well I believe it was a suite actually, on the 18th floor. It even had a couch, dining area, and vanity despite the other sink and mirror in the bathroom. I was totally comfortable, and had to make sure to give my two cents. I don't gamble... But next time there's a show out this way I know where I'm stayin!"
K_k5lh3w881Op3ExwZFgSQ,1,"Compared to the location on walnut street. They have the absolute worst costumer service!!! I called to tell them I was trying to find the place and asked if she could give me directions from mcmasters way. She told me she couldn't because she takes a bus to work. I ended up finding it on my own. It was literally right around the corner. But I was frantic I wasn't going to get there in time to get my cake. There was a mixup with my cake. I ordered it to be picked up at the walnut street location, and here it was delivered to market square which put a dent in my day because I had to go into town to pick it up. After telling the girl at the counter about the mixup, she didn't even apologize or offer a cookie to help ease the problem. The girl who waited on me had a personality of a rock. Unbelievable. I will never be back to market square location. They don't seem very kind nor congenial. Boo...market square location. Boo."

Well 7/31/12 called to check on the status.  Took my information and said will call back.  I will update when I hear something.  Sounds like this is regular business practice for this company.  Im thinking they are hoping that people forget."
imTKtmxIl54MLIXkDyLk_g,2,"This place is located next to the M Buffet. I hate to admit that I've been there twice and I still dislike the place. Service is snail pace, there are hidden charges on the menu, and the food is so-so. On a plus side, the portions are huge and nicely plated, but BEWARE! If you start tasting your neighbor's plate you could get slapped with a ""sharing charge"". 

What it comes down to is bad service and too many rules! No third visit for me, I gave it a second chance and the ginormous plates aren't enough to win me over. 

Hash House is a No Go!"
EGgqTrbjdKrNK2slN7WNqA,4,burgers on the strip. you get what you pay for a decent burger good view nice scenery. However the weather at that location is hit or miss can be windy can be to hot or too cold outdoor seating is all they offer and that just does not cut it in Las Vegas however they are part of El Segundo so you can share that restaurants dinning room if you cant hang outside. Also it is a lettuce entertain you entity and therefore I will remain loyal. Go mon ami gabi GO . In all honesty run across the street to Wynn go to the cafe overlooking the golfcourse and have the best hamburger you have ever had price is under 20 $ it is worth stopping by. Plus you have a view of the 18th hole at Wynn looks pretty cool.
U_ati3APse0CgikmdxN_Aw,3,"Husband went here last weekend on a business trip and hit the strip in search of a good burger. The burger was decent, not the best he's ever had but it was okay. He had set his expectations high being it was the ""Godon Ramsay Burger"" and it was meh...so so. Other thing that earned a 2 star rating was the payment error made by the server. My husband had to place the tip on his personal credit card because he can't tip with his business credit card. Though he asked the server 3 times, she still managed to put the entire bill $$$ on his personal card. Now I'm jumping through hoops with the bank to get the charge removed :("
BQfLwN1OW8aKqRzJbySUqA,3,"The good reviews of Hash Kitchen are driven mostly by its trendy concept and presentation.  The food is actually pretty bad.  To give an example, their corned beef hash was made of cubes of brisket.  You can't cut adequately cooked corned beef into perfect cubes because the meat will be too soft.  The only reason they can do this is because the brisket was under cooked leaving the connective tissue in the meat intact and the corned beef still rubbery.  If they didn't know how to prepare it properly, they were better off just using the stuff that comes in a can."
7IRM87i_18zT4fnS4K46lA,3,"I really have mixed emotions about this place. I heard about it from a personality on the Food Network so I thought it was a must have. Therefore, I made the trip.

Upon walking in it is loud and a bit small but there is seating outside. The next thing I noticed were the prices. There were close to Five Guys prices and it was over $30 for a beer, fries, two sandwiches and hush puppies. The sum of my Ranch sandwich was not impressive. It was a bit too much bread and I attribute this to the thin piece of chicken that was in it. It was much thinner than a Chik Fil A patty. The chicken was tasty so I would do a leg or breast the next time I visit if I do again. The fries were good but standard at best. 

After leaving here, I felt underwhelmed. I feel it was overpriced and under portioned."
xpDUQyM54zd2jDNzlcEJLQ,4,"I love breakfast and I love The Farm House. It is a bit cramped and busy but since I'm usually dining solo, the counter always has a place open. The daily special scrambles are very tasty and each order comes with home fried potatoes and whole wheat french bread. The coffe is also very good as well as they use Illy coffee. One thing to look out for if you sit at the counter is that you come face to face with two of their fresh made chocolate cakes. It takes every inch of my will power not to order a slice, but alas chocolate cake has won out a couple of times."
vVSAiyMuqgl2K2fik9QPXQ,5,"The people at this location is always soooo fun! And lively! Always having a good time, and it's barely ever a long line because their time management and preparation is so efficient! Love this location and I try to come here anytime I am close"
-6GFD0CfOitXMUDOG1rqaA,1,"Will never eat or have drinks here again,first time I went here the bartender didn't even acknowledge I sat down for no joke 15-20 minutes. So I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. I just went back to the same location, played $80 in the machine and the bartender didn't comp any of my 3 beers. I said ""what's up, you don't comp drinks for people playing"" he said the best he could do was take off TWO DOLLARS!! Fuck you. Horrible place to go in a real shit location. Never anyone inside and now I know why. Wings are still good though. Just not this location."

It was like a minute before close but the guy just stared at me getting out of my car I was parked up front and the girl was waiting to lock the door. I work retail I know you want the close the door right on time but if someone clearly pulls up before closing, atleast at my job we ask the customer if they knew exactly what they needed. The girl ran to the back to turn off the lights and the boy just stared at me when I was asking if they were already closed, as if I was speaking a foreign language and couldn't even mouth to me that yes they were closed...all I needed was gloves and I'm not invisible...you looked right at me, and also like the teachers say...use your words bro just say you're closed!"
ChdxmpG2T6xp-xKPEqv7uA,4,"The BEST thing about Shake Shack is the size of the burgers ! Not those huge things that we all eat, but regret as were takeoff the last couple bites....Shake Shack does offer multiple patty options, the single patty works BEST!! In my opinion ~  Their buns are soft and remind me of an Kings Hawaiian roll....which I LIKE, ALOT!! However you have to ask for pickles....ask for xtra Shack Sauce too!!!!
   The Crinkle fries are good! Not FAB, but good . Their shakes are good too! AGAIN not Gr8, but good and also come in a smaller size so your not SOOO bloated after eating~"

Still full of flavor and with the Green or Red Sauce it's on point. I will definitely be back soon with some friends."

Q9LiHbRcw2sN1f-AGqYw1w,3,Food is priced well and tastes fresh. Staff waits to be told to do things rather than being proactive. For example: clearing plates bringing menus and refilling drinks. They are friendly and efficient otherwise.
By0kxUxO3nFRd2O1ZSBcbw,5,Love coming here for the produce early on the weekends. Always fresh and they have good deals. They have a great selection of fruits and vegetables and organic if you choose to go that route. All the rest of te food I think is always a bit pricey.
hZ1gHTiG6OZ3s-6xXomVSQ,4,Haven't been in a while but def super yummy.  Especially the eggs. Do not miss the opportunity to try their burger also.  :)
meGIj_SRPzTvwwniUuUgeA,3,"Ordered a bottomless regular coffee (very good), a spicy mocha (pretty good), and a breakfast sandwich (just ok). The kids play area is a big plus. I was able to eat while my child played contently. However the food was only so-so for the price. Almost $6 for a microwaved sandwich. Sticking to just coffee next time. Cute shop though."

I spent over $20 on a half a grilled cheese sandwich, a steak sandwich and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. I got to work only to find that I recieved chicken noodle soup, which was very disappointing because I was planning to dip my steak sandwich in it.

My stake, bone in ribeye, was more than OK, as well as the cocktails!
Some of us had oysters, they were good!
The crab cakes also passed the quality mark, but the scallops as an entree was sub par!

VUWonMWPCj4u5c9yJc-CTg,5,Super impressed with this company! Called last minute for service 2 days before Christmas and they squoze me in AND did not skimp on the service! They went the extra mile to detail my escalade I had just repossessed back from a friend who couldn't make the payments.... it was GROSS!! They didn't complain at all though and got right to work with a smile to get it ready for my parents to drive when they got in town for Christmas.... I'm sure it took way longer than expected but they didnt cut any corners and worked into the dark evening! I'm sure my tip wasn't enough to compensate so I wanted to give them a shout out on here.... thanks Shineworks!!
iPwcJIvlhK93TTRsXdiCBw,3,"So my friends live in the area around here (Wychwood Heights its called? I unno. St Clair West seems better..)and this is their go - to spot for brunch. I suggested we go to Brunhworks, but they told me this place was a lot cheaper, so $$$ yes.

We waited about 45 minutes for a table in that super cramped little area. That was a mission and a half on its own..plus the cost of being hungover and it was snowing outside (As usual) so I wasn't the happiest per say.


Anyways, we sat down to a cute booth (super props to them fro having a booth that I actually fit into..super props for that)

We had :

1. The Westtern Sandwich - This was.. okay. The eggs were overcooked for my taste, and there wasn't a top of toppings. The bread could've used some butter, but yea. The boom frites were amazing though. Super super super good.

2. The Chick-a-dilla - This was a a breakfast quesidilla I guess. It was quite tiny I guess, bbut the guac was AWESOME.

3. The Power Breakfast - Standard fare

4. My friend's Omelette.- didn't get to try this.

The place is cute, but the breakfast was under-whelming. The servers were super super cute though.

Don't come here during the rush rush hours like we did, but it's a decent place I guess. We'll be back here soon"
guIH5-N7CarDyH0YaSRCsQ,5,"I was a first time mover and was nervous because of the problems friends have had with various companies. I figured I had nothing to lose by checking Yelp. Always Professional in Moving popped up. I was impressed by their reviews and website so I contacted them for an estimate via website. I got a follow-up up call and email within an hour. The price was very reasonable, they kept in contact with me throughout the week and verbally confirmed the move date and time the day before. I was given a window of 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. on a Saturday with 3 movers. They showed up on time, all 3 hustled, wrapped and blanketed the furniture, protected the front door and patio door from any damage. I was moved and unloaded in less than 3 hours, no furniture damage at all. I have a 7 foot bookcase that didn't fit in the hallway and they made it work by using the bedroom window (which was on my suggestion). All my furniture and boxes were placed where I wanted. Because the move took less time than scheduled I was credited the next business day. 
I was definitely impressed with them and have already referred a friend for their move coming up. I would absolutely use them again!"

This has a great collection of books and I'm glad it's around.  It may seem unorganized by appearance but that'd quite the opposite. It is organized like a classic librarian (having worked at a library before).  It's easy to find books that you need and I have no complaints.  

However if you are allergic to cats be warned this is a cat friendly environment.  Also if you have spare tuna give it to the cat because that girl looks hungry."
IjUC2mKkiF1BqgZ5GSQV9g,2,"I went here for the first time in a while two days ago. We moved to a different part of town and this is far away but I still wanted to come back. It has definitely gone down hill unfortunately. The dining areas are full of tons of home made signage that look cheap and dingy, there were tons of menus given to us that were dirty (how many menus do you need for each person? I got three total).  The fish quality has gone down and the fish portions were disappointing. A tiny dab of spicy tuna on top of a tiger roll with so much sticky rice you'll gag. The staff looks well over worked and irritated in general. I probably won't come back even if I'm in the area anymore. Sad, because it used to be really great."

While I'm the shopper who doesn't want to be bothered if I DO need help my expectation is that I can 1) easily find it and 2) be helped. 

That said...I was recently here and for the most part left alone. Several employees made an issue about my being in a CAM walker, wanting to know what I did, etc. turns out there was an employee in a very similar situation as myself and we talked for awhile, sharing stories & experiences. I am quite familiar with her doctor in that mine is in the same practice...

Funny after that exchange how suddenly all the employees were friendly & helpful. All because I had something in common with one of their coworkers. 

I have noticed this store does a rotten job of pricing items that are on sale or marked down. Having worked for Williams Sonoma I know they get a list of items to retag...they just don't. I would have spent wY more money here on this trip had things been priced right. I came in for pillow covers...turns out all the ones I wanted were on markdown but I didn't know bc they weren't tagged accordingly. I ended up ordering these online a few hours later when I saw they were on sale & now must wait for delivery when I should of had them that day while at the store!!

Always double check the price of the item you are interested in. It very well might be a lower price then what its marked."

This class put a lot of emphasis on the decorating portion, but that was great because I am pretty confident in my sugar cookie making abilities. 

This class was held at their new location (on Greary) and the space was absolutely stunning. It was a huge open concept kitchen with work stations. The decor was very ""Pinterest"" and I absolutely loved in. Our instructor, Taylor, was funny, thorough, and most importantly a great teacher. These classes are perfect for the absolute beginner or even the experienced. Everyone's sugar cookies turned out incredible and I will definitely will be looking to taking a cake boot camp."
YwuYjJDYV7iWiJl4l_TihQ,1,I made an appointment with this company last week for today at 11:00.  At 11:20 I called them to see if they were still coming out.

uNXphP64bE9ULiPhIOWDig,1,"Took my auto there for four new tires.  We had made an appointment, and still they were 1/2 hour late getting the car into the bay.  They replaced the tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) on each wheel as well.  On our way home, the TPMS light came on on the dashboard.  Once we arrived home we called them and reported the problem.  They said to bring it back and they would take care of it.  Just for grins I checked the tire pressure on all four new tires - each one had a different pressure and all were wrong.  When we drove the car back to repair the TPMS problem, we were told to come back in 30, no, 45 minutes and it would be done, as well as adjusting the tire pressure appropriately.  We came back in an hour and they had not even touched the car.  Of course they apologized profusely, but still, a truly incompetent mistake.  The tire sale came with free realignments for three months, so my wife took the car back in the other day for her final alignment.  During that process they managed to screw up something and the Traction Control System light came on and it took them 3 hours, yes, 3 hours to figure out what was wrong and ""fix"" it.  The light is now out, but I don't know if they actually fixed the problem or just found out a way to turn the light off permanently, which can be a major safety concern.  It is rare that one runs into an establishment that seems too exude incompetence to the degree this one does.  Think twice about taking your vehicle here.  At least they always acknowledged their mistakes without argument, but what a lot of mistakes!"

This will be short and SWEET unlike the Crepes I received.


First of, if I'm ordering Crepes from a place that has plentiful desserts, I expect the fruits to be sweet and ripe. 
I ordered the basic Crepes with strawberries and chocolate. 

Sadly $10 dollars did not provide me with sweet strawberries. Rather, I received what seemed to be frozen, watery, un ready strawberries. They were even pale in colour. 
This completely ruined the experience for me, as I am a Crepes lover!
The size was not even that big, and they did not put enough chocolate on the top to balance out all the bitter tasteless strawberries. 

I expected more from a place whose supposed to provide specialty dessert. 

Sad to say that even though this looks like a hip place to hang out with friends, the lack of a decent simple dessert does not make it worth my time. 

Sorry but I was very very disappointed."
zDx3aI9QDtNzMLGKVRFdQA,5,"I really enjoyed eating here. The staff was very friendly, my food did not take long at all to get to me, and it had so much flavor. I had the falafel wrap and it was super tasty and prepared wonderfully! Would definitely recommend this place."

gJ-bqT32hkP77pVEwL93Hg,5,"An excellent restaurant with impeccable food, service, and scenery. I've been to Altius twice and both visits were an all around A+ experience.

I was very satisfied with the sea bass and salmon entrées, the diverse bread selection, and generous appetizers. I also enjoyed how the chef sends a complimentary bite-size dish to each table shortly after placing your order. 

The waitstaff, bartenders, and hostesses are very polite and eager to make the guest's experience comfortable. I highly recommend paying Altius a visit!"
0y6f7LhStGkt5-0_rCpjeA,1,"Never had eaten at this establishment but it being so close to the rogers centre, decided to try it out. Food & service were good but the manager on duty was unbelievable. He was rude as soon as we got to the front door. We had a guest inside waiting for us and he basically called us liars and said the resto was full. We walked right past him to find our friend. Tons of seating available inside i might add
Called him over to speak with him & again he was rude, unprofessional and a poor excuse for customer service. We will NEVER EVER return to Hoops. What a disgrace"
TIovTq4TNlDxXFgNLHheJQ,5,"I visited this location always because of the customer service they provide, RODRIGO!!! Is a top notch in customer satisfaction, he take his time to make you walk out of there with a happy face he reset my new iPhone cause the old one was freezing up an the insurance company send me a new one !! Rodrigo did the restore and back up of my pictures and settings AWESOME!! Thanks!!! I will recommend this nice guy with all my friends."
hS8nM3lFIuX3373Yw-vK9A,5,"Wow! First visit to Smoke Pit and Stock Market. What a treat. We are regulars at another BBQ place but this food is the best BBQ, brisket and cornbread I have ever had! Huge portions. And it is busy because it's so popular and well received. I got there at 2 and all the tables were full. 
Don't miss this one if your up that way on 29 near Popular Tent Road."
snsk6TiSu9pDUaJWJuMjEQ,1,"It saddens me to see bad reviews on this place. I've been coming here for years and I've been treated almost like family. The staff are friendly and courteous. Always asking the questions to ensure the best service. They do walk arounds after a wash to make sure the customer is happy. So if you're leaving and writing a bad review, shame on you. If you say ok then there's no reason you should write a bad review. I've always had good quality work from this hardworking staff. This isn't a chain, it's a small business and we should support locally. I love EcoWash!"
9eaj08gSIxquraTDI_CosA,4,"We came her for lunch today. Based on what I've seen and heard I had some high expectations. They were mostly met and surpassed, though one pretty big aspect of the meal really bombed it for me.

We headed in around 12:00 and were basically ambushed. We were greeted, sat, had our drinks ordered and chips and salsa were on the table within less than one minute. So right off the bat I can say that this is a great place if you're in a rush for lunch! But I wasn't in a rush, so I felt a bit pushed through the meal. The chips were fresh and crisp, and both salsas were pretty good (you get a mild, liquidy salsa and a spicy thick salsa). 

The food is very affordable and comes out pretty quickly (a little too quickly for me.) They had a special of the day for $5.00 and majority of the basic combinations on the lunch menu were $5.50. I ordered the #5 combo which consisted of a taco, enchilada and rice. The taco was pretty darn amazing. What really did it for me was the fresh-made shell. This isn't the usual hard shell you find at most places...it's a puffy, crisp holder of goodness. The ground beef (you can also choose chicken) was really flavorful and packed with spices and some kind of pepper (either bell or jalapeno, I couldn't tell since it was chopped pretty fine.) It also came topped with lettuce and some kind of white cheese...I don't know what it was but it wasn't your run of the mill cheddar. The enchilada was also very tasty, and huge! It had the same ground beef as the taco and was covered with a tasty sauce and cheese. The enchilada was cooked perfectly and made for a pretty darn good lunch item. Then came the part of the lunch that was most disappointing...the rice.

I don't want to trash this wonderful restaurant for messing up a single little side item, but when it is a Mexican restaurant with lame rice, then that's just not cool with me. I could actually tell it wasn't going to be good when it came out because it was all kind of mushed together. The rice was definitely waaaaay overcooked and I just detest mushy rice. Not only was it overcooked, but I think the flavor got cooked out of it as well, as it was fairly bland. 

The miss' went with the #1 combo which had a taco, chili relleno, guac salad and refried beans. She went with the chicken taco and it was a flavorful, tender shredded bit of meat. The chili relleno was a bit different as it is entirely surrounded by a mass of scrambled egg. The egg was good, and the chili stuffed with chicken and cheese was pretty darn tasty. If anything, the egg made it a bit much in terms of richness but it was a very good chili relleno (sure beat Monterys.) The guac definitely tasted like it was just made and was very refreshing, with a bit more lime bite than usual. The beans were right on par with other beans I've had...pretty great but nothing too fancy or special.

All in all, I enjoyed the meal very much and will most certainly go back. Despite being a tad bit rushed (I'm assuming it was due to the time we went) and the lame rice, it was definitely some top-notch Mexican. And I definitely have to say that they have some of the best tacos I've ever had...those shells and the ground beef crammed in there is the stuff dreams are made of. Actually, I can't wait to go back and give their carnitas a whirl!"
dtGdMmIZUvF932Ax1zkxaw,1,"Severely understaffed. One employee for the entire restaurant and the chef in the kitchen. Went here at 3 AM, there was garbage all over the floor and all the tables. Never saw anything like it. Was told ""sit anywhere, over there maybe"". After waiting 45 minutes and not even being asked if we wanted drinks, we left."
ddZzAS_7EpEbuLECxDGb9w,3,"Heard good things and went for a business lunch, don't believe what you hear. Service was good, my guest had the salmon salad special, I guess if you ask me for a temp on salmon I expect it to be freshly cooked, not true. Anyhow he liked it all the same, I had a salmon blt, only way I knew this fishy substance was salmon was because it was pink, the bacon was pre cooked, dried out and cold. When you put that little effort into a wrap I can't imagine what a finer item would be like. Bad taste still around, even know."
ydYGViAIqR1C5v-mMGFa_A,3,"I have gone there only because my wife wanted to go. Not sure why people like this place so much except for that it is a good hangout spot for young adults which is fine but I did not find that they have a big collection of deserts. 

They have this pudding in a glass container which is kinda pricey for the two bites it has. The container can be useful after on but then again, if I need a container, why would I spend $7 for it.

There are plenty of other places that are better."
gtnuZTUgfFoqRIekXfCHBw,4,"Mount Royal was very tiring but well worth the trip. Make sure you have water, bug spray and a really good pair of sneakers when hiking up the mountain. It honestly wasn't too bad, but the slant was pretty steep coming from the metro and the stairs were long going up from the entrance. However, we survived it and the view was simply breathtaking. The view of the city was unbelievable from up high. I'm really happy that we stopped here during our vacation. Our legs were sore for 2 days afterward, but I would do it again if the opportunity presented itself."
p8mlY-eFepT7To-0EQqbAA,2,"Food was not bad, Very overpriced. 
There's really not much to say as it all tasted very average. I don't think I would come back as it was nothing special.

We ordered the french onion soup which was not bad. The lobster Mac & Cheese was not tasty - there was no flavor. The Caesar salad was not bad & the tacos were very mediocre. 

On the plus side, because it was Mother's Day - they were giving out a slice of chocolate cake with caramel sauce. The cake was not moist and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a while. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
gwx_3yZh1GBDyb003sIeHQ,3,"It's a little frustrating that movies are now split between here and the Scotiabank Cinema. The movie watching experience here just lacks something, but it makes up for it by having all their cinemas in digital quality, I enjoy the popcorn here (but lack of shakers is a downer for me), I wish they had a bit more range when it comes to the concession stand, it IS in the heart of the city. 

The system is a little unusual with the box office located 3 stories below the theatre, with automated machines at both locations. And as someone that comes here around twice a week, I am more familiar with their loyalty program than most people that work the box office, which is a little frustrating having to explain their own system to them, but the staff at the customer desk are always very friendly.

The midnight release experience here is clearly inferior to that at Scotiabank as they cannot accommodate large lines inside, and had people lining up in the food court for the Harry Potter release, it was the same for tiff, rush lines would be in the food courts and it gets confusing very fast. 

The IMAX experience at first glance seems less impressive than what I'm used to, but after a few trips to both this and the Scotia one, I'm coming to realise the disparity is not as large. 

Their ETX seems larger than the Scotiabank Ultra experience, but the lack of seat assignments makes this lose out on that front. 

If you watch a movie (even if it's once a month or so) it makes so much sense to sign up for their loyalty program which trumps the scene due to the reduced ticket prices, although the rewards come in smaller portions than Scene's, but AMC provides free popcorn via emailed coupons every Monday - Thursday if you pay attention to their emails. 

But this is a massive complex, their movie options are questionable at times (having 3 Indian movies playing in the same time period for e.g.) but it does deliver on the quality front which is enough for me."

For dinner we had a ahi, shrimp, and grilled fish tacos & a chipotle chicken quesadilla. The habenero margarita was delicious and not as hot as I expected. Loved  the up beat atmosphere. We will definitely be back."
_9WMAQorigmKs74xWka3vg,5,I love this place. It very very nice and clean. They all are very friendly. Dr. Boyd and Dr. Ma very good dentist. I would recommend for everyone to come here. I have been with them for 10 years. You will love it.
gyBA_jtftKbBGLUCwvlW6Q,4,"I have had a gym membership here at the Robinson location for about 3 months now. Before, I was making a transition from Planet Fitness to LA. I'm sure some of you have gone through this as well when you hit a wall in your fitness journey. That's how I felt at PF, so I knew I needed a change. I began to look at the Robinson location closest to my home. It didn't take me very long to come to a decision. At the time there was a promotional going on for $0 down and all I needed to pay up front was my 1st and last months monthly fee. 

Once I got my membership set up it was finally time to hit the gym! First thing you notice coming in is all the cardio machines; treadmills, bikes and ellipticals were on the bottom floor. Along with a studio room w/ punching bags, and a spinning class room. Of course the pool as well. Then when you head upstairs are all the weights and lifting machines. Overall, a pretty big gym which took me some time to get used to where everything was and getting the most out of my workouts. 

Fast forward to now, I really enjoy this location LA. The staff is nice and courteous. The equipment is well kept and clean, along with the locker rooms and sauna area. If you are like myself, and you are looking to take your fitness to the next level, it's time to head down to LA Fitness and start taking advantage of the many amenities they have to offer. Let's go get these GAINS!"
EA9s3w5XRFNgql8VU5m0Sg,5,In order to get 5 stars I really have to be wooed so to speak. However this restaurant was great. The server was on point and the pizza was some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. The crust was nice thin and airy. Probably will be a must have every time I want pizza in Vegas. We also had wings. They were good. They have their own flavor combinations for their wings. So thats was a plus. I like to experience different and new things. This was definitely a  pleasurable one. Give it a go. You wont be disappointed.
pewCqQvIw_UdPTAS075O0g,1,"Please save yourself a headache and do not call them. 

System installed then a major leak that destroyed our brand new cabinets. The remedy was to give us a $200 credit. Hardly enough to fix the problem. 

We have had the unit in our new home for 3 months and continue to have issues with a pink staining in the toilets and shower in addition to problems with water pressure. We had a plumber and our home builder look into the issue to find the issue is their tank. At this time very unresponsive even all the way up to the president that has made zero efforts to remedy this problem. We have spent endless hours trying to get this resolved and now await a reply to just taking the equipment and refund our money. We are not happy with the customer service, product or the way they ignore issues and avoid calls. I hope the warrantee they offer is not as defective as their business practices.


Thanks for a reply. Your responses are not aligned with what has happened. Please let me know how to use your warrantee for full refund and you can come get this equipment that does not meet expectations. Jim"

When Frank was a puppy we really struggled with crate training at night, walks, and basic obedience. When Lindsay was done with him he slept through the night, didn't fight us while on his leash, and now knows commands like sit, down, stay, etc. Our little guy has kept all his personality and gained so many manners. Lindsay exceeded expectations and we couldn't have asked for a better outcome. Thank-you!!"

YleMI_VDrx5Tp9_dIVz9Lw,4,"I am pretty open-minded about pizza. I prefer it with a pretty thick crust and no meat but will try it no matter what is on it. This weekend I was without a vehicle (but with my three kids) and not in the mood to make any more PBJs. I wanted somebody to bring me some food, but I was also not in the mood for pizza. 

I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing. 

One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with). 

The kids enjoyed their pepperoni pizza and I loved my pasta (fettucine noodles with pesto sauce, broccoli, and mushrooms. The broccoli was pretty well shredded, but it tasted very good)."
xj_NjzOLgyJgFQbYF-hHpQ,4,"Love the cake they made for my boyfriends birthday party. It is a little pricey but well worth it for the amazing work that they do, they put so much detail in it. I had a hat made with his company logo on it and it came out so good that he did not want to cut it. I had to make him cut it the next day cause I wanted to eat it. The staff was very nice and helpful. I will for sure go back to them for more cakes."
cclQi81H15bucOA_zgd0dg,5,Really liked this place! Came here when I was on vacation for lunch. Ordered the cashew chicken. Very flavorful and filling. Service was really good. The people there are great! Will have to go again when I visit.
mGixbSxoGfezJP49tVp7xw,4,"What a treat! When visiting Tempe in recent years, I always seem to  bemoan the loss of its charm in the midst of its over-the-top success. Then I go to  House of Tricks.
Yesterday's lunch was no exception to the great food, service, and ambience I've experienced at Trick's over the years.  The fresh smoked salmon Caesar salad recommended by our lovely server  was mouthwatering, to say the least. My dining partner and I shared an espresso gelato for dessert which was the perfect finish. This culinary experience is enough to entice me back to downtown Tempe again and again."
urwDt7cSfLXoeDnwNoeWcw,5,"Our boy Nash had a horrible swollen eye and infected ear, so we wanted to find a vet close by to be our regular vet since he didn't have one yet. We adopted him about 4 months ago from the Humane Society, golden retriever/border collie mix. I called this morning asking if they could please fit me in this morning, as I was very worried about him. I told them I didn't mind waiting, I just needed to have him seen this morning. They said sure to come on by and they would try and fit me in soon, which most places would not allow. Very happy, I took Nash down there. Office was clean and office members were friendly. I waited about 10 minutes, no more than I feel like I would've waited had I made an appointment. The vet assistant was wonderful and helpful. The vet, Ms. Ruiz was also very friendly and informative. I did not feel pressured or oversold on anything like some vet offices do. They also took time to examine him properly and do sufficient testing to ensure they knew what the problem was and if there was an underlying reason. I was very pleased with the level of professional service as well as the reasonable prices. This will definitely be Nash's regular vet office from now on."
RyDYFdIu7QbGIjlKPAkW2w,3,"After reading all the good reviews, my friends and I went to try this place out. We all ordered different bowls of non-vegetarian pho and also their rice noodle rolls with mushrooms to share. I had a raw beef pho and while the herbs/garnishes plate was generous and fresh, I didn't really like the pho itself very much. I think the main problem was how thick the beef was sliced and it was a bit tough because of that. The rice noodle rolls were pretty tasty though and I would order them again. 

It's hard to find Vietnamese restaurants with so many vegetarian and vegan options so I think this place definitely works well for that. However, as a meat eater, I think I can find better beef pho elsewhere. I probably should have ordered a veggie dish instead but if they have something on the menu, I expect it to be good."
IdNWzASaYQhUvENmbSxyLA,5,"I highly recommend this place. They have taken great care of my car and is pretty much the only place I will take it. They are honest, friendly and always recognize my car when I drive in. I recommend them to everyone."
uQzbnGtDiOOS21T95BwGkg,2,"Ordered 6 plates to go for my team last month.   I ordered the classic loco moco add mushrooms and onions.   The $1.99 charge for mushrooms and onions was extremely disappointing when I opened my box.  There were 4 small slices of mushrooms and about 13 cents worth of sliced onions that were very tough.  I added the shrooms/onions on 4 loco mocos and all were lacking mushrooms and had bad quality onions. 
I ordered the special ""rib eye loco moco"" which had tough pieces of steak.
Just overall low quality for such an easy meal to put together."

Clare is the best bartender since the TV show Cheers. Oh and the Pinot Grigio there is sublime. 
Do NOT NOT miss the bean dip. 
Dinner there is amazing. I had the Mexican Ceasar salad with mesquite grilled shrimp on it and a side of Fideo, the only place in town that has Fideo. They could cook it like crap if they wanted to but they don't

qYMHd8hLezFSW-vRKrBfUA,5,"The bad news is Publix items not on sale are over priced. The good news is that the sales are great and plentiful. I love the seafood counter here the best. I used to think that they sprayed an Old Bay mist over the seafood to make everyone who walks by hungry. I later learned that they will steam your food for you and that they use Old Bay among other spices while doing so. The seafood here is the freshest of all the grocery stores in the area. Customer service is best. Lastly, the store is bright. It feels clean. There are often samplings. The deli has a huge assortment of meat and cheese options for all of your sandwich needs. I'm probably here 3x a week and it's becoming my favorite grocery store in the area."

And complimentary food/drinks, alcoholic too, is always appreciated. 

Located by Gate E2 on the international side, this lounge is awfully bright, like an office.  Didn't have the Restorations-style super comfy chairs nor any private areas.  

Good egg & tuna salad sandwiches on the go, that's the saving grace. Actually didn't feel pretentious at all compared to others. 

Decent sized, with a light-wood themed communal table with power charging outlets."
cl1CZgXE9XqctFg7kGkxoQ,5,"C'était ma deuxième visite : j'ai des bons souvenirs de ma première visite, elle date de quelques années.
À ma deuxième visite, ce fût moins concluant. 
La nourriture était très bonne dans l'ensemble, pas vraiment rien à redire la-dessus honnêtement. Très bien réussi.
Par contre le service.. Si vous prenez le steak, vous ne pouvez pas choisir la cuisson: c'est saignant, pas moyen de l'avoir medium. À prendre un bon steak au restaurant, ça serait la moindre des choses de laisser les clients choisir leur cuisson.
Le service était in-ter-mi-na-ble. Ça a pris environ 30 minutes recevoir la seule entrée commandée, soit un plateau de charcuteries.. On s'entend, il y avait 2 petits trucs à frire et le reste, c'était simplement du ""plating"".. Ensuite pour les plats principaux, on a du attendre un bon 45 minutes après avoir terminé l'entrée. Et la cuisine est à aire ouverte, on la voit depuis les tables: les cuisiniers n'avaient pas l'air rusher pour deux cents, ils jasaient et rigolaient avec les clients au bar.. 
Jamais de retour de la serveuse pour nous demandé si l'entrée ou les repas étaient à notre goût. On s'est servis nous-même notre vin toute la soirée.
Factures qui sont arrivées avec des erreurs, malgré qu'on avait 4 items pour 3 personnes.. 
Malheureusement, un excellent service peut rattraper une nourriture moyenne, mais un service tel que l'on a reçu, malgré la bonne nourriture, fera en sorte que nous retournerons pas. Pour être sortie avec une facture de 55$ avec taxes et service pour avoir manger un plat principal seulement, mon expérience ne valait pas ça. Pour des prix semblables je préfère Chez Lionel à Boucherville."

The customer service is lacking majorly! I went in to get a fill and the lady who worked on my nails took the original polish off but left a mess, there was nail polish still all over my nails and all over my skin. I asked her if she could get it off and claimed that the polish that was on was too deep and couldn't get it off! I've never heard of that!!! Plus she left my nails all crooked and when I asked her to fix them she made a big deal about it. And she filled my nails down so bad, that they are throbbing now. So dissatisfied with my latest experience and so disappointed to see this salon change."

The issue was not fixed to my satisfaction. -- I ended up just moving the couch to a different part of my house and buying a cheaper one that we actually use. I decided it wasn't worth the aggravation of arguing with the Salt Creek rep any further. Their customer service guy, Tanner, was completely apathetic and rude. Pretty much as soon as I gave them my money I was no longer their problem anymore. He even suggested I call the out of country manufacturer of the couch to have some of my very basic questions answered. Such a headache and a very expensive lesson learned."

With that said, I don't think I'd get the steaks here, I didn't really like it too much.  The steaks were not as charred as I liked, and those frittes were under seasoned and underwhelming.  The pate was good, and the escargot was yummy, but like I said, underwhelming.  I will give them props for their service, the waitress was really sweet and attentive.  Don't know if I'd go again, but it was good."
XWjWTtNIfhj4EFlF7XiPvA,1,"I used to enjoy this location but it has seriously gone downhill the service is sub par the food is cold and bland and the manager is a jerk. We came in on Wednesday night at 6pm there 
was no wait we were sat immediately and it was not busy we sat right by the entrance there was never a wait the restaurant was pretty empty. There were 6 of us 3 adults and 3 children they were out of crayons ok
so 3 Super bored children, the waitress took our drink order and which took a while to get then we placed our order and waited with 3 hungry bored kids when the food arrived it looked like crap on the plate there was nothing about it that was appealing and everything was cold especially the eggs they were like rubber. Any time we needed a refill or extra napkins we had to track down our waitress and when she brought the bill it was $71 dollars. I looked at the bill and could not figure out how 3  kids breakfast meals and 3 adult 1 breakfast, 1 dried up hockey puck Swiss steak and one fish dinner added up too 71 dollars. After I got home I studied it closer and decided to call and are if the manager could explain. He was SO RUDE he told me we ordered the wrong stuff it was not on the kids menu and I said ok well I must have misread the menu but the waitress could have told me or mentioned I ordered it differently so they were charging me for adult meals. He again said it was my fault and hung up on me. Yep I am calling corporate a dinner out with family turned into a ridiculously expensive mess!"
zcNJUnvgFmlU2CTJWhZdBg,3,"A decent Korean place, though it's tough to compare with places that are actually in Korea. The seafood pancake was a bit too small, and it didn't have enough seafood in it. The pancake itself was a bit mushy.

The tofu with seafood was okay - wish there was more of a fresh tofu taste, and wish there were more seafood bits in the soup. The pork bone soup was somewhat better as it seemed to be boiled for a long time, allowing the soup to absorb more of the flavor.

Generally decent! Would recommend.

Also, I think they serve food till late. Went to a show, walked back, and seemed as if people were still eating there!"
UUPa11Y1FGG4dqxEIMiwKA,5,"This store is awesome.  I don't typically leave reviews, but I must say this Lowe's store has by far the BEST customer service on the planet, not only were they helpful in choosing a washer and dryer for our family...we left something at the store by accident and the staff went above and beyond to return it.  The staff here is top notch and definitely some of the best people in the world.  Definitely getting our next appliances at Lowes Again!"
k_HzgYL5hcVKGUcuFoD06A,5,First time here and we are very pleased!! Great quality and very good customer service!! Highly recommend my kids loved it
VYX0OuBXGFhS5meDzcPzag,4,"This store location is much improved from what it was a few years ago but it still lacks many of the items found in a full sized HT. But, (YEAH!!!) they will be expanding soon which means there will be lots of construction and an even tougher time finding a parking spot but it will be worth it in the end. I too was someone who tried out Bloom only to be disappointed in their prices but this is about HT.

I like the selection of fruit & veggies and found many organic options which I loved. The meat aisle offers little more then the expensive Angus Beef options but if you look around you can pretty much find what you want. I have never special ordered meat there but I'm sure they are more than willing to take care of your needs.

The deli section has a great variety of lunchmeats and cooked meal options and even have a smaller sized make your own salad bar. I would love to grab more lunches there freshly made but the parking almost makes it impossible to get in and out and back to work in a reasonable amount of time. 

Their frozen food section is getting much better. I spoke with the Mgr. about 2 weeks ago asking about a new item I wanted to try and yesterday when I went it was there along with another item I had told him I liked but never found in the store. 

If you coupon clip and get the e-Vic card then you can definitely find some great deals. I really like this store and the weekly deals and specials, if scheduled by me right, fit well within my budget. With coupons I saved quite a bit of money on their weekly specials. 

The store is always clean and the service is pretty good and can be really good if you go during odd hours otherwise it can be busy, packed and tough to park. I highly recommend trying this store."
8ni_WJnGWmJ19ggsX12IBw,3,"Visited Scottsdale for the first time last week and was looking for a nice coffee shop to stop at. I ordered a latte and also an aero press coffee. The latte tasted average. The aero press took a little longer. The worker started on other drinks before ours and had given them to customers that had ordered after us. Not that we mind but he didn't bother telling us that ours would take longer or what not. When the aero press came, it had an interesting taste, almost a sour after taste. Not sure if it was the type of coffee we chose but it wasn't really to my liking. 

Quite a hipster place, the staff too. The place is quite small. We came on a Saturday and there weren't much people at the cafe."

I recommend this hotel highly!!
Thank you guys!!"
ruNf0JsW9IvJE0t5rrpcDA,4,"The sushi was delicious and the cooks were real friendly. My only negative comment on the place was they don't have the AYCE option. We all know sushi is expensive, especially when you go for dinner.  Usually an AYCE sushi place for dinner will run u 25-30 dollars. For 3 rolls including tip my bill just for me was around 50 dollars. If this place had AYCE, definitely would've been a 5 star rating from me."
WIhdToUlydcRLWljwuKE1A,5,"Tonight I tried something new and it was amazing! I ordered the Steak Diane and it was yummy! The flavor combinations were perfect and my steak was cooked exactly how I asked. The best part was desert. I typically say I'm going to try a new cheesecake and then get my tried and true Oreo cheesecake. Tonight I decided to go out of my comfort zone and went on description of our server: Chris' Outrageous Chocolate Cheesecake. It was amazing! If you like German Chocolate cake, this is a must have!"
AQ6xy-OyBQ8PqEkeTdFCeQ,5,"Found this place using Yelp and decided to check it out. Nice little place with good ambience!!
Tried the 2 & 3 meat sampler which covered all meats available.
The Brisket and Rib Tips are the Winners!!
Tried 4 sides and the Bourbon Peaches are like eating Peach Cobbler without the crust!!
I will be visiting quite often!!"
EwTDOUDXD11ODsZLk05qJw,5,"This place was awesome. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. We went around lunch time on a Friday. There was only one table with customers, but hey we got a good seat next to the garage window and it was a beautiful sunny day. We split the mac and cheese and if you like creamy, this is it! Heavenly, and so delicious. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and boy was it worth it! My dad ordered the Fish and chips and they were absolutely fantastic. From the customer service to the food, I will definitely be coming back. We were too full to order the apple pie, but we will be back so we can make room next time! Thank you for a great first time experience!"
MCSHxeSvrGakr2mrBV-xxQ,4,"Orange chicken is the way to go. They have a variety of meats (steak, chicken, shrimp). Different rices or chow mein available. If you haven't been to a Panda Express before, you order from the line and they serve in front of you. Ask for a sample if they don't offer one!

The parking lot is large enough and the location is near a light on South Blvd which makes it easier to turn left. Overall a good value for what you get and pretty consistent quality"
M1hrt5sS4nhAXsP_riBeXQ,4,"No need for fancy clothes. Ain't nobody got THAI for that. If you're hanging around Henderson and looking for a casual, appe-THAI-zing place to grab lunch, Gata Thai is a good option to THAI on for size. Don't worry, the puns stop here.

Their lunch special is from 11a-3p and a steal at $6.95. Included items: soup, salad, egg roll, and steamed rice (except on noodle dishes). I was sad to see no pad see ew is offered as a lunch special, so I went with pad thai. Honestly, it was a little too sweet for me. The service was friendly though and decor was just enough for a pleasant vibe, so I'll come back to try another dish.

Bonus: Free thai iced tea with yelp check-in!
Another bonus: 10% off if you pay with cash. 

Win-win."
3YWer3rNHdFxF51kmKI7CQ,4,"Casual place. Smells are fantastic. We sat at a window and had a nice view of the strip. Eats okay. Had the veal marsala. I hate to say it, but it is true, this doesnt hold a candle to the same dish at Caraba's."
g-BJ0iIoHd3Jeggr5GmPRw,5,"I have been going to Lifetime since 2007. I really enjoy the gym! I have 3 small kids and they really enjoy the child center. They try to keep it clean and fun for the kids. They have different activities such as rock climbing, Zumba, a playground outside, a huge maze inside, iPads, and a separate room for babies and toddlers. 
As far as equipment, they have modern machines and a good variety and quantity. Even during busy times, I have always been able to find equipment or machines to work out. 
The classes are great too. I started in 2007 with Zumba and got hooked to coming to the gym everyday. I have also tried water aerobics, cycling, and a group weight training class. I really enjoyed all of them. The instructors were knowledgeable and made the classes fun. 
The cafe is excellent! I love the food! It's fresh and very healthy. My kids beg me to eat there every time I take them. I love the California chicken and the protein smoothies. 
The pools are excellent! My kids love the water slides and when it gets too cold, they really enjoy using the inside pools! I also enjoy the saunas, the steam room and the jacuzzis. Seriously, lifetime it's my second home! There's so much to do, I could spend hours there! 
I have also tried the Spa with my lifetime points and have enjoyed a very good massage for almost nothing! Overall, I would definitely recommend this gym to everyone, especially if you have kids!"
phobT4NgQbRsma8_jHdlZg,4,"This place rocks. I am so happy I can get turkey dogs and turkey corn dogs here, done up all fancy with so many exciting and imaginative fixings. Prices are fair. Place was popping on super-fun Tuesday night trivia night. Great tap list, too! Everything everyone ordered was a hit. Things sounded great and WERE great! Only complaint/only reason not to give 5 stars was that the food service was really spotty on trivia night. Food took forever to come, and waitress failed to bring mustard for corn dog (after I asked) for a long time; eventually had to walk up and get it myself. Casual, fun environment. When I have gluten-free or vegan friends visiting, I know where they can get cool food!"
aSBcEfO7sMP6K2nXUVOopw,5,Thanks this place great food and service. The girls at the counter very nice and friendly and helped with order. It's casual place great for lunch.

Tasty doesn't begin to describe it. 

As far as price goes, you'll save a heap and not go home hungry for lunch!
The gumbo is fabulous and the mac and cheese is a definite yum!"
G112Hg_YYBWHAnUqJ7safQ,5,"My Ram 3500 Longhorn Mega cab dually 4x4 is a ton of sheet metal.  Michael showed up early, set up his job, got to work without hesitation, and did a beautiful and thorough detail to my big old truck. Even the white lettering on the tires shined through. No excuses, disciplined service, and on a Sunday as well.  This worked out well for me after a surgery,  thank you."
YmfGS1oKpnUjHlK7gCi4hg,3,"The $5.99 Large Cheese pizza deal is a steal.  That being said, this isn't the greatest pizza out there but for that price, it was pretty good.  The pizza was big and the sauce to cheese ratio was good.  I also got Caesar Salad that I threw away because the lettuce was wilted and gross.  I wasn't too upset about it because of the cheap pizza.  It is definitely worth a stop if you're looking for a cheap pizza."
gB5PVzwfn41nHuh4BsJTcw,4,"I travel for work so I'm always looking for good food thats not fast food. I've been in Arizona almost four months now and this place does not disappoint. Every employee is very nice (just one not so nice one), the food is always great and cooked properly, the salad bar is always fresh (no green lettice) and there is a nice selection. 

The one thing I would say is that it would be nice to have the chilled plates for the salad, but it's a little thing. Definately won't stop me from coming to this location."
4tSb_vhowd3znHnHHlpeMg,5,"Twice used, excellent and honest service. 1st x, Father's Day 2017 our garage door springs failed. Matt came out that day and replaced springs. 2nd x, garage door opener failed 1day prior Super Bowl. Called Matt; he tried to save us expense to troubleshoot over the phone to determine if replacement was needed. Without success, Matt serviced and replaced opener the next day/Super Bowl day. (His pricing for replacement opener was comparable to HomeDepot pricing for new opener.) Very happy with his service and honesty."
hYV9y5igOJqdZeDBYyiAtQ,4,"We went to this place once. I have ordered a crepe with a scoop of ice cream. You can choose whatever you want to put in it like banana, strawberries, nutella, syrup, whipped cream etc. My partner had a waffle. We paid around 15 bucks which is a reasonable price. It was very tasty and filling! Might pop in there again next time we come to Vegas!"
cf2ZFMQmKjwajcNQ1n0AbQ,4,"Went there for lunch they were busy but sat us quickly. Lots of families out eating there. I had the steak & shrimp and salad with mashed potatoes w/ gravy it was good. My husband had the steak & shrimp with a baked potato. He liked his food too. The service was friendly and helpful. It was a nice place to eat at, will return soon."
8WK1i602j4CEQS5R7tzKJw,5,This place had the best burger in Vegas. When I go to Vegas I will definitely come back to try out their other burgers. The waitress was very helpful and told us what was good and the best choice everyone picks. She also kept refilling our drinks without us asking. Best service ever hands down. It was this young skinny female with glasses.
uFV6FGeCbSb2pq9LeHwgkw,5,Brooke is amazing at what she does. She has some skills! She has done my ombre and my daughters hair for a few years. She recently just did my son's first cut as well. She is very patient and takes her time! I will always recommend her to my family and friends!

jcEFxtTIGtBUdDEc4R-hCg,1,I will only speak the truth. Tandoor Chicken is not from a Tandoor or the Naan or Tikka.. It is FRIED.  You are better off going to a restaurant that has the proper  ingrediants and equipment to cook the food in. The owner is a nice oerson though but probably just order the wine

The line up is outrageous just to get a number, you still hve to wait to be called after that. The line has over 50 people in it and there is only one staff member handing out nunbers.

QXCtUayeVowt1jNX_AnQAQ,5,"Fabulous salon! One block from the strip on East Flamingo. Easy to find, and for tourists its an easy block to walk.

I first came here in July of 2018 before they were on Yelp. I waited for them to open for months. And finally a salon that is open late hours! Sometimes we like to get things done after 6pm. Not everyone works 9am-6pm. So, super happy a salon that caters to the late night crowd. We are a 24hr town!

I have started to love pedicures only because 'Frank' makes them so enjoyable. His massage and delicate approach have me half asleep in the massage chair. He truly is the best I have ever had. Request 'Frank' you'll be happy you did. And tip them! They go above and beyond the service you request.

The salon is beautiful with large flat screen tv's, massage chairs, chandeliers, comfortable waiting area, extensive color selection and excellent customer service.

Happy customer, happy feet! 

Thank you."

I could almost say I love going to the dentist :)"

Over all this is a really good place But wish they got more dessert option...."
UaTvHUNL56J7ZSTYo5X5WA,3,"Spencer's:  Great                   
       Extended Warranty offered by Spencer's:  AWFUL
I have purchased many appliances from Spencer's over the years for my home and two rental properties.  Their prices are very competitive with other stores.  Their salespeople are some of the most knowledgeable out there.  I know that extended warranties are usually not worth the money, but I don't want the hassle, and Spencer's does have the best prices if you do want to buy an extended warranty.
When I bought a new refrigerator for my own home a couple of  years ago, I purchased the 5 year extended warranty, for fear that I would have trouble with the in-door icemaker. 
Sure enough, the icemaker went out in May, 2015.  Only one adult uses the icemaker, so it is certainly not abused.  I called the warranty company that handles this.
     THIS WARRANTY COMPANY HAS BEEN TO MY HOUSE ELEVEN TIMES SINCE LAST MAY!  They have repaired or replaced just about every  part in my freezer.  At Thanksgiving (2015), they asked me to empty my freezer and defrost it, so they could replace a water line they believed was frozen.  I had to ask two neighbors if I could borrow some freezer space for a few days (this during Thanksgiving).  Not enough freezer space from the neighbors, so a lot of my food went into ice chests on the patio (some food just didn't make it).  After all of this, THAT repair did not work either.
They kept trying something new at each visit.  Each repair did not work.  Still no ice.
Finally, in early January, warranty company says they have tried everything.  They will order me a new door.  A new door??!??!?!  They PROMISED me a new door would take care of the problem. But, I would have to wait 2 months for Whirlpool to ship a new door.  I really like my refrigerator (I just want it fixed!!), so dumb me says OK.   In March (2016)  - Warranty company calls and says my new door is in (I have a side-by-side refrigerator).  FINALLY!  My nightmare will be over, and my every-other-day trip to the store for ice will end.  I can't wait.
Warranty company shows up and says ""Uh-oh. We ordered you a stainless-steel door, instead of black.  We are sorry.  You will need to wait ANOTHER two months for the correct door to be shipped from Whirlpool.""  When (or IF) I ever get the correct door, and IF that works, it will have been a total of ONE YEAR since I first reported my icemaker not working.
        In defense of the warranty company, the repair techs. have seemed truly sympathetic, and are very nice. But, this warranty policy is the worst.  (I happened to be in Sears the other day - they said their policy is to replace the ENTIRE appliance if it could not be fixed after 3 attempts to repair.)  
        My recommendation:  If you want just an appliance without any warranties, Spencer's has great prices and knowledgeable salespeople.  But, if you want to purchase an appliance with a warranty, you may want to shop around.  DO NOT buy the extended warranty from Spencer's."
hOP6t-AzvGZ3w589rjIc5g,5,"OMG, the reviews of this establishment are DEAD WRONG. This awesome spot is open 24 hours a day right smack dab in the middle of the amazing Caesars Palace. Not too big and not to small, we came in late night for a bite. In all honesty, I was a bit hungover from the night before. I ordered the dumplings, they are made to order, by hand and took a little longer to hit the table. My family ordered two beef stew, Kung Pao Chicken (no peanuts) and a pancake wrap. Excuse me that I don't remember the fine details. It's Vegas, I had a bit too much fun the night before and I really wanted to crawl back into bed. 
When our food came, literally- the heavens opened and the choir of angels sang. My dumplings were amazing little purses of flavor. My sister was able to share a slice of this pancake that immediately made me regret my choice as well. The stew, with it's hand pulled noodles, rich beefy broth soothed me. And my dad, his Kung Pao chicken.. to die for. I came to life. Suddenly, I was okay and thought to myself, this is a bit of heaven. I wish I had ordered more. 
After getting home, I found a few celebrity/ food network shows that had visited and sang praises to this place. They were right on the money. If you want, authentic Chinese cuisine- go here and take a chance. They take pride in making food that pleases your soul. No, it's not American-ized. It's good Northern Chinese food, done right and good in a small, but delicious space. The staff is super friendly (my sister had fun taking photos of the girls making noodles) and willing to help you choose something you will like. No shortcuts. Seriously good food made from scratch, authentic and they don't mind if you want a few tweaks to fit your taste. Relax, good food takes a little more time so use those extra minutes to smile, talk to your friends and just breathe. Vegas is so fast pace... this place is certainly a ""stop and smell the roses/ dumplings"" place. Nearly impossible to leave unhappy."
A5HBXgp9UV0knydSg7tKFQ,4,"I wandered in here after bar hopping. The food was so amazing, I decided that I had to come back when I was sober to make an actual judgement on if it was as delicious as I thought it was.

It was.

This quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on East Carson. I honestly think this taco place beats out the famed Las Palmas, in Oakland, as well as Reyna's in the Strip. The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing. 

I think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good. However, my favorites are the pork tacos, and the chicken nachos. The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 a taco, $5 for nachos), and they take cards! They also serve soda in glass bottles, which is nice. 

The place is open late on weekends, making it the perfect drunk munchie sort of place."
yeLXSfYGsVuk9U63WFj0iQ,5,"Really good food at an authentic spice level. The green papaya salad was great, as was the larb. I will definitely be back.

Great little patisserie at the Gare Centrale."
7DTaadb1MWue2ttwnvBSSA,4,"A huge underground mall, which makes sense considering how frigid Montreal gets in the winter. Lots and lots of shopping to be had with plenty of restaurants and movie theaters.

The Eaton Centre also connects to the Underground City, which is worth seeing itself too.

Had a beer and don't remember what I ate. Towards the end when we had to do a diaper change and they didn't have the facilities for it, they helped us out by letting us use a booth in the back. Bonus points for helping out. I would go again."

The burrito itself is 3 stars but everything else about Sneaky Dee's is 4 stars.

The burrito was very bland as it was just meat and refried beans with cheese melted on top (yeah I know that's the traditional Mexican way but I'm going to bitch about it anyways).  The plate came with rice and a ""salad"" which was a great addition to give the meal some flavour.

The vegan pumpkin cupcakes were awesome (for a vegan cupcake).  The service was pretty good but not anything worth cheering for.  The beer specials were great also ($3.95 for a pint)."
r9yn9hZx9d2gyOehmGs-5g,5,This is the best Cora's in the GTA with impecable service and very consistant food. Most Cora's I feel seem to not have enough staff working and feel very disorganized. Anyways I highly recommend and I personally eat there every week.

j-q_wk6K2zZgethr-Nhy3Q,1,"Red Rock is where my husband and I spent our wedding night and we enjoyed it so much we decided to come back. We came back for our anniversary and were quite disappointed. We found out all pools and hot tubs were closed and it was nothing that came up while making our reservation on their website. Apparently it was noted in a side link about their pools but because we stayed here before, we weren't reading all the side links. That is a huge amenity to not have available and its a big part of why we came since my husband is recovering from a back injury and we looked forward to utilizing it often during our multiple day stay. We are quite deflated at not having better communication about such a large amenity being gone. We drove over 5 hours just to stay here and we were going to book an additional night this weekend but will be looking else where. The front desk didn't answer our call and when I went to the front desk, they had nothing to contribute to a better stay for our anniversary.
We are very saddened."

_r4X7n5QVdQOX2_VhczSIw,5,"I had excellent service from two different people at this Firestone.  My first experience was for a tire rotation, balance and alignment.  I had purchased tires from a Firestone in another state and they came with lifetime rotation, balance and alignment.  I took my car in and they were very prompt and recommended service that I could have done on my car (standard procedure I'm sure) but were very helpful in providing a quote (good for 30 days) if I changed my mind.  They also guaranteed their prices and said if I found the same service for a lower price, they will match it.

My second experience was with my husband and he took his 2003 Honda Civic in for a water pump replacement and timing belt replacement.  They were very friendly and efficient and even honored our coupons from the website. They also offered price matching on this service.

I would definately recommend this location based on customer service and price."

Kaylee (possibly Katie, or even Kathy. Blonde one with the aggressive eyebrows) did a great job. Very friendly. Even made drink recommendations when I was unfamiliar with a certain type of liquor. Great job by bartender and staff around. 

Will definitely be back."
5M8O5bYiCj6Kp1Nb7R8dtg,3,"This a chain. You know what they have, you know the price point, no big surprises there. There are so many chain pharmacies in Charlotte and they seem to do very little to differentiate themselves from one another.
 
Thankfully, I only have one prescription I have to deal with and just have to go by once a month. But, on that monthly trip I'm immediately irritated if I go inside. Generally I'm the only person at the Rx counter and there are 2-4 employees working. No one acknowledges you for at least 1-2 minutes; it's like they have a timer and can't speak before it goes off. Then, all they say is ""Be right with you"".  When someone does finally ask your name they dig through, find your Rx, make you sign the insurance book and cash you out with no more words. It's really amazing how little communication goes on. 

The drive-thru pickup, if it doesn't have a long-line is slightly better for some reason. Not personable at all but at least a bit quicker. 
I'm really just rather meh about the place and wish there was a local pharmacy that took my insurance."
VZfHjcFA5P05WWdxt8_aKQ,5,Great southern Ms style soul food. Huge portions. You may wanna consider sharing. Love the smothered chicken.
F9QCOGwDDYqheklviSSY-Q,5,"I will ALWAYS take my car here for work that needs to be done. I have worked with Matt every time and he is awesome! 

I got ripped off at the dealership down the street (Pinnacle Nissan) because they charged me HUNDREDS of dollars more for work. 

Sun Devil Auto has honest guys who give a fair price and work with you on parts and labor costs. They do a thorough job and they are very friendly and help you understand exactly what you need and what you don't need. 

I highly recommend Sun Devil Auto for any car repairs you need done. They won me over and hopefully you give them a shot and see for yourself. 

Thanks for the great service, Matt!"
aWWYF5PW2sIVy6nynzhLUg,4,"I love Future's, because it serves oh so many purposes. Their breakfast is pretty generous and if you take your student card it's something ridiculous like fifty percent off. You can drink, you can eat insane amounts of perogies, you can get a coffee, you can rock the patio. Most importantly though....you can get CAKE. Like insanely good cake of all different kinds and pieces so big you'll want to finish them so badly but just won't be able to. Yeah....I mean it's pretty hard to go to Futures without being tempted by everything on display behind the counter.

I've spent plenty of nights here just talking with friends for hours, so I've got some pretty fond memories. It's a great place to grab a coffee, chill out, and not be rushed or anything. Also good if you want to bring a book and sit by yourself. Only one qualm, which I think somebody also mentioned too. They use cheap, store bought orange juice (which is totally fine...) except they make it look like it's fresh squeezed by pouring it into separate containers and putting it in a little fridge. I was tricked! 

So, if that's my only bad thing to say, then  Future's has pretty much got it going on ."
BEqZVWYtxvQnqomtOd-02Q,4,Very casual place. Good food for good prices. This is a place to take the whole family and not break the bank. Camarones empanizados and a pilsener beer is my favorite! And I always take some pupusas to go. Service is also very good
oN4vhSJeM69fRITR8HWqdg,2,"Garlic Balls (or whatever they call them) were tiny, crunchy pieces of dough. Not even worth $2.99. Sausage on pizza tasted microwaved. Pizza was good but not good enough to make me go there again. Ranch on the other hand, was damn good. But they forgot it and I had to go back."
b8QdM2mniV7P_A5LKK4cjw,5,Friendly staff and good prices. Love the sushi! Have been looking for a good place since moving from CA.
Mhmzdg4jIJvZrbnLEch6Fw,5,Los Gallos is a real authentic handmade style Mexican food. This ain't no Taco Bell! My favorite spot for Mexican food !
Ey5qvCIzmEV9g5yeQ2f3yA,5,"OK, this is the first review I have ever written, but I felt compelled to do this one.
Udder Delights is the BEST ice cream!  I have been there several times and each time I have tried a different flavor.  I have a new favorite each time I go there!
I was there Saturday night and it was ""standing room"" only...so I think the word is getting out about their great ice cream.
Their pastries are also very yummy.
Keep up the good work Udder Delights!  I will see you soon!"
sMOiXkzwVesm1s72HY6sOQ,5,Visiting from Los Angeles and my friend brought me here. This place is amazing. The staff greets you right when you come in. We were helped right away by a very enthusiastic guy! He put on a good show and was really friendly. The ice cream tasted AMAZING! I had the pineapple delight... sooo good and creamy.
phFKZFSwxl8HZ3c4MKzEBA,4,"I ate here for the first time last night. Me and friends came in around 530 and were the first customers. Customer service was prompt and attentive. The chef even threw in some delicious fried chicken skins. We were the only customers for a good 30-45 so I can't comment what service would be like during a full house.

The was pretty good. We had the okonomiyaki (pancakes), shumai dumplings, fried oysters, and delicious takoyaki octopus balls!
We also had the Tonkontsu Ramen, lamb skewers, and pork sandwiches for the main course. Ramen was pretty standard when compared to other quality Japanese ramen shops. 

I'd come again to try the other skewers.
This place is also great for sharing with friends. So everyone can try something different."
lQP9_f_mGFfnak2ZLVn9YA,4,"Came back for an anual Smog Check. This trip was for my MR-2 Spyder. As usual, great friendly and professional service. I was offered a free tire rotation but too bad I didnt have my lug nuts key. But I still ended up getting a usual courtesy inspection even a nice quote to replace my battery l, rear breaks and 90k service. I dont know how they normally run as my husband and I with the help of my dad usually do our own maintenance. A 90k service it just a bit of a hasssle for us to and we had been postponing it. So I more likely will take it here since they had been good to us with three vehicles. Thank you for the great service today Charles!"
uVBO8dWU7Rf2Koy29McakA,5,"If you have any bit of skepticism on staying at this place, you are correct. It is s an outdated dump."
Hg-dkw5gMn6hBTaiu-slrA,4,Great Mexican food made like my Mama & Nana did it! You can't get any closer to old school home cooked food unless Nana cooks it! Love their fresh chips. GREEN CORN TAMALES are Chicken MOLE is the Nest in Phx IMO. Service is good & beers always cold!
vW5222Ipfqmj2On231v7FA,4,Really nice old school hardware store. On one occasion I needed a part for my very old bathroom faucet. After getting nowhere fast at the big hardware stores I came here and the gentleman not only knew what part I needed he had it in stock... I was in and out in 5 minutes.
FqD3YmBo0Thoe_qRGQ_QOQ,5,"I finally tried Bella Vida for the first time and it was every bit of amazing all the other reviewers are saying! I was referred by a friend. You know how sometimes people will talk up a movie or a song or a restaurant and then when you finally hear or see it and you're like it was good BUT.....well not here. No disappointment and was everything my friend described and more! You will not leave here disappointed. Alex cut my hair today and what I loved was that he showed me what 2"", 3"" and 6"" was to him before he cut my hair as I was trying to decide how much to cut off. Excellent approach to setting up trust. I 100% felt comfortable and pampered."
gvbM5P2RuCmLZER-GGBqpQ,2,The patio was great and the server was nice. The food was so bland and expensive for what I got. I ordered the seafood papardelle pasta special. It was a pile of dry noodles on top of a little flavorless olive oil with a few shrimp and small amount of crab for $26. So disappointing.
drRk_aLOr-fNTj-l6iLzRQ,5,"This is perhaps the fastest Internet connection it has been my privilege to use since I left University. It's insane how fast stuff downloads - I am the envy of most everyone in my office for the speeds I can get, as well as the transfer cap (300 gig!). The price is more than competitive, I feel, though the recent price hikes certainly reduce the edge there.

The installation experience was as painless as you could hope for. The installer came towards the end of the window that was specified. Fortunately, the window was 15 minutes wide, and when he was done inside of 20 minutes I had four Ethernet jacks with 100 megabit Internetty goodness. Since getting the service in April, I've only had one minor outage - while I was at work - and a minor billing issue that was quickly resolved.

If you live in CityPlace and get some other Internet service, I can't imagine what your reasons could be."
rfsmGq2SameQjmflznllqQ,4,"You know what , this is my to go place just to lay out . Gets me a bucket of corona and a quick dip. Refreshing! Not a place to actually do laps but a place to hang out for a bit. It use to be where locals can come in for free but things have changed for the last couple of years. Now its a big 20 if your not a guest. But if you can spare a little but sure 20 is not that tight either. Besides we can spend that 20 elsewhere quicker than 4 hours that you'd be hanging out here right? So shed that dough and dip in !!!!! Happy swimming!"
4tEGZ9ALN0UKINTHxxgIFA,5,I love this med shop! The staff is so friendly and accommodating! I definitely would recommend the monster cookies or lavender when coming here. They have more than enough strands as well as other eatables and treats! Prices are reasonable for a great product!

VjxYG8AX8fpQmn-OxXK7Xg,1,"My wife and I just left after having a couple's massage. That was one of the worst massages we've had, ever. I'm a big guy at 6'5 and 260 and that woman seemed to take pleasure in hurting me. I had back surgery several months ago and can't take it too hard and wanted more time working on my back. Negative. I think I need surgery again. wife and I  both complained that it was too hard and both masseuses laughed at us as they were speaking to each other in what I  assume was Chinese. My wife had a male masseuse and she even complained to the manager partway through but the torture techniques continued.  We are actually going right now to get massages somewhere else because we're in so much pain. Lastly, it did not smell pleasant in there.  I  don't often post on yelp but I felt I had to."
Bf_shKruXvfeFPSfAk6LSw,4,"I can't believe how inexpensive all of the food and drinks are!!! Better than that, they give generous servings and the food actually tastes good especially for the price of under $5. I got the nachos for one which had more toppings than most other nachos (it even had corn on it). Plus I was given the choice to add guac and some meat for just over $1. The atmosphere is great. I love the set up of the place, it's more contemporary and edgy. The music was played really loudly BUT to compensate, it was a really good playlist"
wdEFJmyA4ToO9XSx_OshtA,4,"I have been extremely pleased with this office from the front office staff to the doctors. Our initial visit they took lots of time to map out a plan for our daughter. They used visuals and answered all of our questions. The wait time has been acceptable during our office visits and they have been easy to schedule emergency appointments with. We have already seen huge progress with the movement with our daughter's teeth.  My only complaint is that they are not open at our Chandler office daily. However, I would highly recommend them and will use them again when my son needs braces."
cdJfb9BBmFlg64JKZVLgyA,5,"Absolutely fantastic! Make sure to get it fully loaded! Happy employees as well, always an important addition to me. Been twice and both times it's been just as fantastic. Great prices as well!"
fV3N-_zFbHpB3IDlP9cyfQ,5,"Some of the best gelato I've ever had!

This place is jammed packed full of sweets, most of which I've never even heard of.  Which was awesome!  The only thing bad about this place is they close so early.  I can't tell you how much more our group would have spent if they were open until 3AM.  Probably better for our waistlines that they weren't though!

We also had a quick dinner here as well one night and the sandwiches were good.  All were about $10 a piece and huge.  We didn't finish our food.  Stuffed!"
mdD39IK6W5VjdXNZvkaAFg,3,"Let me just say, I don't care for the park very much. However, I have found some cool quartz pieces on the hillsides. Be careful around rocks, as there are rattlesnakes obviously! The disc golf is awesome and even beginners get the hang. The park itself is usually crowded during peak hours but it dies down when kids are in school."
Ms_SFAZVw5aoO3G-jp2FYA,5,"Wow I am so sad this place has new owners! We brought our food home today and upon opening the container we noticed the food has changed. The new owners are not doing things the same and I will not patronize this place anymore. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am to have lost my favorite kabob place in town.

My steak was dry, the saffron rice recipe has changed and tastes nothing like it use to. Different salad dressing, which was the only change that I sort of enjoyed as it was refreshing and light but I still would have liked the old Iranian style yogurt/ketchup recipe they would give me. They forgot my hummus, which would have never happened with the old owners. Now they are skimping by not putting bell peppers and onions in between each piece of chicken, really? Peppers and onions are so cheap! The pita bread was not as soft either and hard on the edges like it sat out too long. The chicken flavor and the fries seemed to be the only thing that remained the same.

This place will not last since all the regulars that come here expect the SAME EXACT FOOD they have been eating forever. I personally have been there dozens of times and I have always received the best service and food and they were always so consistent. I am shedding a foodie tear tonight and if the old owners are reading this please let me know where your next restaurant will be!"
wRL0Ft3GBfBHbZsTbbjAMg,1,"WORST place ever!!! DO NOT go here to buy a car! They lie and scam and try to hide stuff from you but yet want to act like their ""helping"" you out by giving you more then your trade is worth, but when you finally look at the numbers trust me they are not helping you they are getting their money PLUS some. The car I was looking at was listed at $21,890.00 WELL the paper work in finance shows up as $28,881.00 WTF! I had already been there for 5 plus hours and was super tired and hungry but who would have thought the price would have changed so drastically? So once I went into finance to sign, I thought it was so weird that he did not go line by line over the charges like new car price, trade value, negative equity you have to carry, rebates, how many years the terms are for, and final payment ( iahve bought about 5 cars in last 10 years and NEVER have they not gone over every line in finance) but I was so tired its 9:30pm by this time so when he knowingly slides the paper work just right to the bottom to sign it kinda triggered me the next day and I said you know what I need to review all my paper work. So I get the papers and OMG yupp sale price of car is $28,881.00 so that is HOW they are ""helping"" me by selling me a $21k car for OVER marked price of $28k .....I am truly at a loss of words, I knew yea I was going to have to carry over some negative money from my trade in but dear lord not $7k more. They think they can get away with murder because Nissan does their own financing/banking. Also not to mention finance guy said yeah you get free ZAKTAX sun protection every 6 months on the car too, but again there was a paper showing I was paying $397.00 for this $5 car paint protection YET again never told to me i was paying for this. I know my bad for being to tired and stupid for not asking to see each line of cost but never in my life did I think a human could be this shady and scamming with a dam smile on their face. I hated car sales people before but now this is at a whole new level of hate, and they have made car buying an even more hated thing to do. My car sales guy was Eddie Ysai, manager Cameron Akins and finance guy I cant remember his name but I have his card, ALL these assholes knew what was going on here and all did it with a smile, they are all liars, schemers, money taking fools....ooooo and I cannot forget that they also ask for your debit card during the app time, to verify you but then take the card to the back, and I could be wrong but I really think these people call the 1-800 number to your bank to check your balance, because then the pressure came with are you SURE you cannot put any money down. Everything about this place was all shady as hell. I should have read all these reviews before ever going here.. BEWARE people!"
N017G2kVJT2o3WHEK-KSpQ,4,"Even though it was delivery, it was a very Italian experience. From the person who took my order to the marinated olives I had as an appetizer, you can tell this place has some authenticity. 5 of 5 for being a great delivery option; prompt delivery, hot food, good food, and courteous staff. I hope I get the opportunity to visit in person! 

I had the assorted olives as an appetizer, a small side salad w/poppyseed dressing, and the vegetable lasagna for an entree. The salad was a typical garden salad, but was very fresh. The dressing was also very good. My lasagna was awesome. All food arrived hot (salad was cold & crisp), and although I finished up some work and allowed the food to cool down before eating, it was still very good."
Yi0dPgRzeUxG0ObecZC3RQ,1,"This place is so far away from the strip and next to some very shady apartments. We, along with many others had our phones pick pocketed from the casino floor. The phones all end up in these shady apts next door and no one will help you get them back. We drove over to our pinged iPhone location to find security outside the rental office. When I approached the dude to explain that our phone was stolen he told me I could try to approach the apt complex myself to figure out where the phone was but I needed to avoid the active crime scene nearby(I'm not making this up)... We contemplated what to do for a min but then a SWAT truck drove up... 


I digress, time to review the hotel. There are hidden resort fees, the hotel room and bathroom are super dusty, dark, hard water stained, and the cleaning staff won't replace your towels if you don't leave them on the sink counter apparently? 

I'd rather spend my money pretty much anywhere  else. For your own sanity and enjoyment id choose any other hotel over this one."
nt0FdBcROlafp7H2q1yCgw,5,"Marco and Jerry came to move a large, heavy built in refrigerator out of our home.  It was a very difficult strategy to remove it from the house. They did a great job! They were courteous, careful and very professional.  I highly recommend this company. The price was right as well! Excellent service!"
7enpZI3XVH7afOQXRb5psw,4,"I had given VETSBuilt a one star review previously for not contacting me when I ask for a quote. I am retracting that review and apologizing to VETSBuilt for not seeing their response via email through Yelp. They also tried calling me and I did not answer because I didn't recognize the phone number with an out of area Area Code. They also left me a voice mail that I did not see till later.

So since they have contacted me with an explanation and it was within 24 hours so I am giving them 4 stars. We worked things out and DJ was very courteous on the phone. They are now coming out tomorrow to give us our quote and we are happy."

zVQEj2Klvjjmpudh7VmXtg,3,Matcha soft serve in a cup because im just not a big fan of cone. They do have freshly housemade cone for everyone who is into it. Not much aesthetics in a cup but A+ for taste. Matcha flavor is strong and texture is creamy and thick. Cute place with a photo station set up with props and backdrop.
z0erYBfN4qGzuug3Rks1RQ,5,Always loved the Main Street location. Was very excited about the Summerlin location! Wonderful atmosphere and great good.
avJee8_AT6ayfj9Rhp2jwA,4,"Just stopped in for my first time, and really enjoyed the food. I had a New Yorker which is basically a cheesesteak with bacon. Between that and my cajun fries, I couldn't finish my meal and I'm a big guy so you know the portions are decent-sized. The employees were friendly and it's a cool old-school diner."
sQhjjsM7jeO3ZTs0khzZ9Q,3,"Not my favorite live music venue in town.  They pull in good local acts weekly, and the drinks are tasty and inexpensive enough, but it's a bit too loud to enjoy the performances without blowing out an eardrum.  Do stop-in to see Moose, though - he's cool."
8vlx2Idy4elEzZu2DA4J7w,4,"Sunday Happy Hour ALL day, do I need to say more! 1/2 priced Oysters and Lobsters and 1/2 priced small assortment of Appetizers along with cocktails and beers. We've been here on other Happy Hour days, but I think because it's all day on Sunday it doesn't get quit so packed, a stream of people throughout the day, maybe?

I can only speak for Happy Hour seating at the bar is very good along with service. The Happy Hour selection is very good. My friend and I had a dozen Buck & Rider Oysters, Steak Tartare, and the Dixie Chicken Fingers. My only complaint and I don't know why: The Flies are out of control in the Bar area, the 3 times we've been there so far (always sitting at the bar by the back entrance). I don't like flies near me or landing near my food. Maybe fly strips or something?

Atmosphere: very nice, Food: very good, Service very good"
awqyiRCqyUnEPSWeFVumuw,5,"Shoe Therapy brought my beloved Botkier Black Rose handbag back to life, after what I feared was an irreparably broken handle. The straps on this bag are made of 3 strands braided together; two are leather but one is a kind of mesh chain, and this is what snapped in half. The whole strap needed to be re-braided and the mesh chain re-attached, and since it's metal it couldn't be glued. Somehow, they managed to re-connect the chain and wrap it with a thin band of black leather to match the rest of the bag; the repair is barely visible, and my favorite bag is back on my arm! They also strengthened a couple of places where the mesh had lost a few links in the same way. I'm so happy to have my bag back and the price for the repair was only $30 - more than reasonable, especially since it sounds like it was a lengthy and tricky repair. The service was friendly and professional. I will definitely bring any future handbag or shoe repairs to Shoe Therapy."
epSXF0S60WfQx75nFaJn7A,1,Scheduled an appt for someone to come out and clean our windows and also for a bid on monthly cleaning... he never showed and didn't call to reschedule. That is NOT  the way to run a business!!
VX9fN5lNiCBrMtmMQxsSww,5,This place always has friendly staff. It's a very clean and beautiful setup inside. I love their desserts. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!
L8sDd2gBevCPb-2BnSbxCA,5,"This was the second Wrangler I bought from these guys. I initially ordered one from Larry Miller Avondale, which is closer to my house.  When I went to pick it up I was told my trade was worth $5400 less in just two months. I was given a great deal last time from the Surprise location.I called them and they said to come on in. They ended up putting $3000 more in my trade than Avondale did."
PC2pYOiDMXfEJEuuaGWJjA,5,I'm so happy to have my grandson and my son and daughter in law living here. We all love the shaded property which is so hard to find in the desert valley of Phoenix. The staff is very friendly and attentive to detail. Thanks for being an oasis in the driest state we have ever lived in!
ORPYunLFJ3x1vRkDzhx2tg,2,"What the heck happened?! Ended up here for lunch today, around 11:30. Keeping in mind my last experience, I expected this to be a tasty deli lunch experience. Ummmm jokes on me I guess. Everybody's food was SO BLAND. You know how the best food is the restaurant food that taste homemade, but honestly you know you could never compare if you actually made it at home? That is what I wanted, but did not get. ARGHHHH. 

My brisket wrap did not have any horseradish despite the menu saying it would. I choked on the meat it was so dry. And the chicken salad was mostly egg salad. IF I WANTED EGG SALAD I WOULD ORDER EGG OK?!??? The marinated mushroom was just a chewy mass. Like they just whipped it out of the bunch that they marinated and put it on some bread. Not even grilled. So disappointed!!!

I am still giving two stars because it was fresh, just not good. So learn to work with the quality and you'll be killing the deli game. 

p.s. Sauerkraut balls were good, but probably only because they were fried. They were made with mostly corn beef anyways, not sauerkraut. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"
N4qGWLMVnSinc6G3ZO8EvQ,4,"I've been coming here pretty frequently for a few years. I used to work down the street which made popping in for a post-work beer very easy.

I've since left that job but moved closer to Angel's, so I'm basically a Sunday evening regular at this point.

32 beers on tap, plus about 5 wine selections on tap as well. I'm more a stouts and porters girl, but you never know what you'll find at Angel's! IPAs aplenty, stouts, porters, gose, sours, fruit beers, ales of all kinds, a cider or two, and seasonal beers are all common finds. There's usually 2 on the nitro tap, and a rotating selection of a few Arizona beers. 

I mostly sit at the bar when I stop in, and the bartenders are all quite friendly without being overbearing. Some forget to give you a glass of water unless you ask for one, some give you one automatically.

The place is not a sports bar, they have two TVs playing some manner of sporting events (usually football or baseball) with the sound off and closed-captioning. Music is also usually unobtrusive, thanks to their random Pandora offerings. If you're the type who prefers a rowdy, sports-centric bar, Angel's ain't the place for you. If you want a somewhat lively bar with a nice, large patio, extensive beer selection, and solid food options, this is the place.

Oh, the food. Their menu isn't huge, but it delivers in unique-ness. My favorite thing on the menu is the Central, a fried chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, pepperjack cheese, bacon, red onion, jalapeño ranch, and cucumber. The cucumber is what makes it, for me. Their fries are quite tasty, thicker than shoestring fries with a house seasoning that may just be seasoned salt for all I know. Be warned -- their ketchup is made in-house, and it's nowhere near the usual Heinz stuff. In my opinion, it would be more complemented by mozzarella sticks than fries, but if you go in knowing it's not your usual ketchup, you might be pleasantly surprised.

I've also tried their soft pretzels app with beer cheese and beer mustard. Very good, light and fluffy hot pretzels. The Outlaw burger is also a solid selection (pretty standard BBQ sauce/bacon/cheese/onion string burger), as is the Matador sandwich (brisket, cheese, horseradish, peppers and onions, if I recall).

I'll be back. Obviously."
-vtnclv-CC6iDlSfnMt4hg,5,"This used to be Flame Kabob but they have since changed their name to Fresh Kabob.  But everything still tastes the same to me. 

I love their chicken and beef kubidehs; packed with lots of flavor.  When I grab lunch from here, I scarf it down quite fast when I get back to work.  It really is that good.  My ultimate favorite side here is the Baba Ghanoush!  OMG!  I can't get enough of it, you can really taste the eggplant like it's been roasted.  Yum!

I love this place and come here at least once a week for a fresh lunch."
4-fWXP0eel-HtzrX0JFuLA,4,"Highly recommend the stir fried beef ho fan (flat noodles) with taro crisp layered generously on top. Once mixed in, it offers much more flavor and texture to the noodles. I suggest also trying their BBQ pork with rice - good portion and also very succulent! Moreover, the chef's are more skilled in making dishes on the wok than their steamed dim sum."
S-MbjOBtU_g-wNhU_LTJXw,5,Loved this show. Talented down to earth rockers doing a wonderful job of telling the story of classic rock. They Did a ticketed meet & greet before the show and a free meet & greet after the show. They interacted with the audience and all did a great job. We had a great time and would highly recommend this show.
OEyqEso9rDAdZt7tH0MZQw,1,"It was one of the driest and most flavorless meals I have had. I had ordered quarter chicken 1/3 rib combo with a fresh vegetable medley which apparently was neither fresh nor flavorful, it was sad looking frozen vegetables that were blanched in tepid water. 
The chicken was dry and without any flavor and the ribs were so tasteless that I cannot explain they were barely touched with the bbq sauce. 

I will never goto a swiss Chalet ever again."

v3D3fZdLmu0nFp_l7LhgWA,4,"The owner of our bed and breakfast recommended this place, and we're thankful he did! We were able to get an outdoor table with no wait even though it's Saturday. The server was very helpful and enthusiastic. We tried the calmar- it wasn't what I was expecting, but the sauce was so good I could have eaten it with a spoon. We both ordered the chicken leg quarter. The chicken was tender, moist, and flavorful. I had medium spice and felt it was just right for me; I'd say it was equivalent to most Thai mild- spice levels (when a no-spice option exists). Overall, this was an excellent vacation dinner."

Overall, a very good experience & Enterprise does have the highest online ratings of all the car rental providers at CLT. The staff was professional, efficient & gave me an unexpected free upgrade when in the parking lot b/c it was my birthday. The woman was kind enough to check for vehicles with lower milage since I'd be traveling alone in the mountains of Asheville. She also took the time to teach me how to operate the SUV's features. When I picked up the Buick Encore,  it needed washing & did have multiple scratches on the back bumper. (I purchased the additional insurance for piece of mind though.) The SUV was also out of washer fluid to clean the front windshield & it needed it!!! The woman at the booth exiting the airport helped me clean the window w/windex & a rag. Grateful for that! Overall a good experience but in a competitive market, it's the little things that make a big difference. Again, staff was very professional, gave quick service & courteous."

MgTEd79BeA79ZgyqwajUkg,3,"This company was called to clean,seal,and repair some grout. We were told all can be done on same visit. They get here and proceed to tell us it can't. So then we make appointment for following week and leave a grout color chart with us and say to match your grout color and a tech will call the night before and find out your choice. Nobody called and now I just received a call from them saying... ""This job was just dropped on me last night and I didn't realize it was an hour away. We can't seal ceramic tile and..I don't want to drive out the for a grout repair"" ummm ok...beware of the fake 5 star reviews made by his buddies."
rv4grebCzYZww2g6GRYmhw,2,"The hotel and a business efficiency seemed decent enough. However, upon entering the room, it was filled with the stench of mold, floors were wet, and decor looked like it hadn't been touched up in 10 years. Not even was the envelope inside the welcome book clean. Everything looked as though it's been stepped on and clearly marked from other usage. 
Service was barely helpful so we checked out, canceling the remainder of the stay and booked another hotel room.

The rest of our weekend will be spent coughing up phlegm and downing antihistamines to avoid getting properly sick from our allergies to the mold."
l6HNLh_SEjy-vkMDVwq9vQ,5,"I just discovered these folks again - I used to go here years ago but moved and sort of lost touch with them. However, after going here yesterday - this is the place I will come back to from now on. I was so taken by how much they paid attention to detail and went back several times to make sure they got this spot or that spot.....and it was SO HOT outside - but they didn't stop until they felt they got it done correctly...I was SO IMPRESSED!!!  You can tell the folks who work at this place have integrity and a strong work ethic that you just don't find anymore. What a treat and the car looks fabulous!!"
6bwF5DvGHFJGwCuuAFcQQA,4,"Thus far every time we've gone to Donut Bar, we've pre ordered the night before in order to get the donuts we want. I love the Crème Brule donut! My husband is a fan of the Butter Beer Donut and anything Chocolate. We tried a couple new ones this time and they weren't that great...i.e. The Apple Fritter (not Apple-y enough), Pumpkin with filling. I thought the Strawberry Split was fabulous though and would certainly get it again.
We do the free coffee with Yelp check in each time and we've never liked the coffee.
Whether you are a fan of fluffy donuts or cake donuts I'm sure you'll find something to make you go mmmm!"
FHXL93hg82IbsZY3x_vZwg,5,"GORGEOUS STREET!!!!!  So much to walk down or bike ride and day dream.

We used to live near here and you could tell when the Suns players were home and when they weren't.  All the Escalades were there when they were in town, and it was dead when they weren't.  Two of the Suns players live across the street from each other.  We even ran into Shawn Marion in the gas station."

hWttD4lZDajDG-R15Uo9GA,4,"We had dinner during our first night visiting Montreal. All the food was fantastic. The portions were ample but not over the top, and the dumplings were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I would have liked a little more variety on the menu, but I can understand the need to keep things concise in a small establishment."
Rr_oF6-yaQ_LkV8FCTfiYQ,5,"We picked up our new Lance 1685 travel trailer this past March 2017 from Tom's Camperland in Mesa, Arizona and we love it!!

We had a great experience overall with Tom's Camperland.  We drove all the way from Connecticut to pick up our new trailer, since our sales rep Allen gave us a very competitive deal on a fully loaded new unit we could simply not refuse.  At the time of our pick up, we had plenty of time to do our orientation and the pre-delivery inspection.  From the moment we walked in the door, the receptionist and people on the floor were very welcoming.  The service staff (with particular shout outs to Adon and Andy) was very accommodating and they showed us all the systems inside and out, with water and electric hooked up, including the AC.  I was also pleased they went over the hitch setup process with great detail.  Since I am new to towing, one of the staff rode with us around the city neighborhood to get a sense of how the rig would handle, how to handle turns, braking, backing up, etc., which was greatly appreciated.  Throughout the entire process, everyone at Tom's was responsive to our many questions and concerns.

We spent 10 nights in the Mesa vicinity at two lovely desert parks, Usery Mountain and Lost Dutchman, for our local shakedown.  Camping there in early April was delightful.  The camper was very well prepared for us for delivery, as everything worked well with no issues.  Our overall experience buying our first travel trailer from Tom's Camperland was excellent and I would highly recommend them."

Ka80NVjLJZPl6C6btVld_Q,5,Jason did a great job on my tattoo. He is one of the best artist I have seen. The shop is very clean and the quality is the best in town.
_Zq_Jd2tBApvv57pLegp2Q,4,"I love the sandwiches here! I know, not what you would expect from a Pie place but the pastrami is delish. I ordered a medium pie and wings last night and the pie as usual lived up to expectations. I did order the wings extra crispy and they fell well short of even regular crispy. It as like a wet Cheetos and that's not OK. Usually they do a good job on that but this time they fell short. Their consistency to provide a solid array of food keeps them atop my list in the area, just make sure you emphasize that you want your wings cooked a certain way."
IKwm-4JtM9h3kUCGpW-TOA,3,"Despite being crowded the hostess found us a table which was nice to be seated promptly on a Friday night. The service was average, there were times when we were out of water and waiting for our food, but nothing too terrible. We had a chicken and waffle dumpling as well as a pork belly dumpling and both were fair and somewhat pricy for a small portion. We had the pad Thai with chicken and it was too greasy and lacking chicken. We also had the vegetable curry with tofu which was delicious but also lacking tofu and very pricy for the portion size. Overall it was ok."

02rOnhd9yZgHlSTwiZC1gQ,5,"Let me tell you about this funny, delightful little woman, Kim. I recently wore out my credit card at a men's store Going Out of Business sale and brought several pairs of slacks to her shop in mid-December to have cuffs done. 

""When you need them back?"" she asked suspiciously.

""I'm in no hurry,"" I replied. ""After the first of the year?""

""OK,"" she said. ""Just so you don't want them before Christmas. Everybody want before Christmas!""

I took my receipt, went home and thought no more about it. The NEXT WEEK, I get a call saying all my pants were ready. ""How can this be?"" I asked, incredulously. ""I thought you were swamped.""

""I see pants. I thought you should have for New Year's Eve,"" she said.

They were hemmed expertly, and woefully underpriced. (I gave her a big Christmas tip!) I would recommend Kim without hesitation to anyone looking for a caring, professional tailoring job."
5eV6CzI1xAfWQrgmjnv37g,5,"One of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto! There are always lineups, especially during dinner hours and on weekends. Food is amazing - pad thai, papaya salad, pad gra prow, curries in coconut shell. It's one of the few places that serves fresh coconut water that doesn't come from a can."
Eyiwx1JO5vkyrEYeXBpVWQ,5,"Nice intimate hole in the wall mom and pop Pho shop. I only had the Pho, but it was absolutely piping hot deliciousness. They also have bun dishes, com (rice) plates, if it's taste wise to the level of the Pho broth, I'm sure it will taste great. Very traditional Vietnamese Nam people regional food. We also had bun grilled shrimp and egg rolls, and beef jerky papaya salad as well. Thumbs up. I will be back to try the bun bo hue and bun rieu Pho sho! Also the prices are fair, place is nice, clean, great service too. My water was refilled three times so that was excellent. Come eat and you won't be disappointed."
TQ_XZ3znf8o0bIB-OuJx0Q,5,"I'm a major poutine fanatic. Ever since I went to an A&W in Alberta, my love for cheese curds, fresh cut fries, and brown gravy has only grown. This place is amazing. 

Small and semi-hidden location but definitely packs a flavor punch. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone, including vegetarians! 

The employees are friendly and eager to please, and your poutine comes out relatively quick. 

Whether you are poutine obsessed like me, or have never even heard of it, check this place out. It would be amazing for any meal, and especially after a night downtown drinking. (Or the next morning, they have a hangover poutine...)"
zkyEwmxTvACmkxDc_Lag-w,1,My experience at this store is horrible. Customer service is terrible. I purchased a $1000 TV. When you pay at the register they tell you to ask the warehouse workers to show you the item is the correct and functioning item you purchased. I asked them to take it out the box twice and they refused. Said item was working fine. After taking it home and waiting for the the cable company to set it up when the TV came on the screen was broken. I called the store and they refused to honor the warranty and replace the TV. This store is cero stars if that option was available.
6gTAPkOYMDNaCIjTFIVMBg,3,"I came to Ensira for a New Year's Eve dinner and was surprised to find the place serving a few full tables at 9pm on this celebratory day--it shows that people will come here even on a day where it's excusable to have an 8 course meal--I'm assuming this is a relatively popular local restaurant. 

My companion and I (always) order the vegetarian platter, which was $18. We asked the owner/manager if it's $18/person (a popular way Ethiopian restaurants seem to charge for their dishes) and he said it's meant to fill one person, but we may as well order 1 and see if we would be full. We were not. The platter is enough for 1.5 people(person?). The owner noticed we were not quite ""satisfied"" and when my friend asked if we could get another bowl of the sides, the owner gave it to us on the house. Now this is how you do business!! With the extra side, I had a very satisfactory and filling meal. So (you know what I'm going to say next), the service here was exceptional, including the waiter and waitress.

Food wise, the injera (which is gluten free) was very delicious in terms of flavour and texture. Also no upset stomach yay! The sides were not oily but was not as flavourful as I would have liked. Their best side in the veggie platter was probably their beets and this one side (that I cannot figure out what it is from the taste/appearance) that leaves a bitter after taste but is quite flavourful. The other sides were meh--again, not enough flavour.

Overall, food is a 3.5 (especially for the high price point), but the generosity of the owner and service from the wait staff moves them up to a 4."
x4BkZ5ZpheiEr1pP-VQHYQ,2,"L'avenue has great food and strong command for interior design but less than acceptable customer service. Sadly as a New Yorker I was less than satisfied with the host on a Monday afternoon. He gave me a dirty look as I snapped some photo's of the interior and asked me if he could help me as if it was unusual for someone to be photographing the great art on the walls. I ordered a quick smoothie to go and on the way out he walked over the me at told me to be ""smooth with the photo's."" I'm less then impressed with this kind of RUDE hospitality and have to warn others that it's NOT the most inviting of restaurants to visit.  If anything they would want to encourage publicizing the space, right?"
BK3nqJYW5cD_wkjxWU-WcA,3,"pho: huge bowl, broth was ok, not the best but not oily and came out hot. the tai (beef) was on the harder side and the sach (tripe) was too chewy.
pho sate: dad and mom liked it
com bo loc lac: ok but my niece had better. the beef needed to be more tender.
eggrolls: 2 free with check in. crunchy and tasty
overall: standard vietnamese joint. don't expect to be blown away but you will get full. 
probably will not be back as there are other places to try."
VNBURZoV-fG57oJterKeyg,4,I had the Groupon which was a great deal. I ordered the shrimp taco and croquetas and both were awesome. They even have a points program for regulars. The one taco and tapas was just enough to fill me up!
NmYPaAVSmMs8_ik1mBoV7w,4,"Very real very authentic Mexican food.

The tacos are really good, the nachos were tasty and large portion.

The burritos come with beans and rice only and pico,so I would say to skip the carbs and go tacos loco get 3-5 as they are small but delicious."
a1P5N_R0H_Mrd7SMmbCcNQ,5,"What a strange and sad day for Pittsburgh's restaurant scene this has been.

First, I discover this morning that Benkovitz Seafoods has gone out of business after over a century. 

After arriving home from work this evening, I called Krazy Brothers to order pizza and instead got Vinny's of Brookline!

According to the fellow who delivered the pizza and hoagie to our house, Krazy Brothers sold their phone number to Vinny's. So if you call the listed number from Krazy Brothers, you'll now get Vinny's. 

 Krazy Brothers was one of my 2 favorite pizza outlets in Brookline, the other being DeMino's, and it too is empty.

I had a sinking feeling that KB was done when I noticed that the storefront was unoccupied the last few times I rode past it. 

It shoulda been Vinny's. For shame."
nSAHJ53fceiV4FytlLbD6A,5,The pho was great and the vermicelli bowl as well. Service was really fast and our server Nero was really nice and funny! Will definitely come back
66ygicxEUy_M8bosVD7clw,4,"Service was great and I spent the entire lunch staring at their awesome exotic fish tank! Oooh sharks! I really enjoyed the salad and soup that came with the lunch menu, both were very refreshing.

Unfortunately, my sushi was not. It felt a bit gummy in texture which made me think it was not all that fresh. It tasted fine and I felt fine afterwards, so I guess it was ok. Still, I could not get over the texture!"
DAdFTiU5VDnqCrpNryUBwg,5,"Always get amazing food here. Top notch. We were there last night for our anniversary and they gave us a free app, which was so nice of them. The server (Shawn) was excellent. We had a great experience."

mFgBpcJ2zyOEIPNv66GWkg,4,"Very good pho and I had the lunch special..Mongolian (un)beef and was also really good..portions leave a little too be desired but that's my gluttonous American culture coming out..a bit on the pricey side but quality ingredients and good food create that balance..keep in mind, I love and easy meat on the daily"
xBUfz_c-fzsIzGqVEfbzYw,5,"Jason James was direct and honest. He gave a price that beat the competition, had the vehicle & paperwork ready, and follower-up to make sure things were going well. Nicky, in finance, also did a good job. I hate car dealerships, but these guys did a good job and made it relatively painless."
J9zX4qOIPORHAr2dGa4-eA,3,"3 stars for the BEST COOKIES EV-ER!

Seriously, if they had an all you can eat cookies deal, I would go for that.

I don't even know why I bothered with the rest of the buffet."
vki4Nwt-ZKnsvvSNjuMnqA,5,"My husband found this little place near his office a few years ago.  What a gem.  The owner Jaime, is honest, fast and very good.  He knows what he's doing.  Not the biggest of places, but he has a nice selection of jewelry.  He's designed some custom pieces for us, working on one for me right now and we couldn't be happier."
eUn1rhFGaFAsyMyqVVkKUQ,5,"Oh Melt, how I love thee.  Let me count the ways.   I love you Fruity Pebbles,  the Nutella, and Vietnamese Coffee, the Green Tea, and the Strawberry Banana sorbet.  Was truly a flight of fancy for my taste buds.   I love the one of a kind shop itself.   And the service was outstanding.   Btw, the sample of Cucumber sorbet was perfect to round out this treat of a night."
kkNjSgf3sTz7whryQj4ELA,3,"Went to Room 112 a few weeks ago on one of my nights out. We arrived around 7:30 and while the place wasn't packed the waitresses seem a little disorganized. The waiter we had while slow and was very nice and polite.  

We ordered soups(seafood soup), appetizer(the salt and pepper shrimp), and 2 sushi rolls.  The soup was awesome, the salt and pepper shrimp a little under whelming more like the what you would get when ordering hot and sour chicken without the sauce..just some pepper sprinkled on top.  The sushi rolls were pretty good.

Overall I would return if asked or in the area and needing a bite to eat."
x6xidfgcEYOBDr_x06-kqQ,4,"Whenever I go back home, I try to stop by DiBella's. The Godfather is pretty much one of the best subs that I have ever had. I can see how some people may not like this place, but I'm one of the ones who love it. DiBella's has a unique flavor that sometimes you just crave, like sometimes you just need a McDonald's fix or Pizza Hut, etc, even though those places are garbage. DiBella's gives you that craving, plus it's damn good! Their decor inside isn't bad. Nicer than Subway or Firehouse. I usually get it to-go. They would get 5 stars if they were to open one up in Las Vegas."
ULgwd-MNB7qWYtp_mK68aw,4,"This is a chain, and I typically don't rate them. Basically, when you go into one, you know what you're going to get. I just wanted to say that the staff at this location are wonderful. They are friendly and the place is clean. Five guys make some wonderful burgers fries and shakes. If that's what you're craving, don't miss out! I've never tried one, but they do dogs as well. The topping options are vast for both. Enjoy!"
jPhPHfScTkI6eW2IQtNtEQ,4,Really happy with the Greek pizza and the bacon/provolone fries. Speedy delivery to our hotel downtown. Would definitely order again!
PaBKvKo4c6pxlF77EOrjRg,4,"We booked the hotel last minute on Vegas.com and got a good deal, it was only like $200 a night with resort fees.

The staff is friendly as well"

btw. I worked here like 2 yrs ago, only for about 2 months though lol (i had some extra time in my hands so I took it as a second job) the kitchen is so clean!! (at least back then) They use fresh ingredients. I always like to take my friends and family there :)

Also, try the sangria :) soo yummi"
ytvJ2A1vjrAXXtZ0nxJ_zA,4,"the oyster bar is is very good, the gumbo and pasta they make is awesome. there is usually wait because there are only like 15 seats and you must sit at the bar. children are now allowed because it is a bar. they service is good considering they time i went there were only 2 people working, a cook and a cashier that also help bring out food and clean up. must go if your in vegas."
fUpwQMFBylupDZL-w5QZig,5,"Wonderful food, atmosphere and service. I have been here several times, each time is better then the last and exceeds expectations time and time again. From the a mouse bouse that changes every few days to the minarde treat that you get with your check. The teachers are kind and knowledgeable about wines. The amazing thing is that the servers are students. The cooks are students. They make me proud to be a student here at ACI. 
If you want a 5 star meal with 5 star service and 2 star prices come to Du Jour restaurant at Arizona Culinary Institute."
S0yFUlINtvdhARmpWOzNKw,2,"I went to the place for the first time with a friend. Hard to find. Had to go into a shop to get directions even though we had GPS. Once there it was empty... completely empty for a normal lunch hour. We are both hippie eaters, whole foody kind of girls. There was nothing on the menu we found interesting that we couldn't have made ourselves and while I was on the groupon/fine dining list, it still was outrageously expensive. We shared a salmon dish, tiny and bland with globs of sour cream and capers thrown on top.  The quinoa (that was extra) was so cold we found it hard to eat. The waitress was super nice, if a little over attentive (read: bored) and we could not decide what to eat since we have all those ingredients at home. It was $30 for a main course that was not even an appetizer in size when shared, and my friend had one coffee. We tipped 20% but while we are both into bringing organic food into the world more and more, we could not perceive how this place can continue to exist. I think that the cost of owning a place this nice: as it is a really super nice interior, really classy must be way beyond allowing this little business to survive."
0ZkilOst9sFG4eflHO9nlw,4,"Dining paradise in Vegas! Besides buffet and fine dining, there are so many good restaurants on the strip.  I would say Gordon Ramsay burgr is one of them!

In order to avoid the line up, we went to there at 6ish.  Still have lined up when we arrived!  After 20 mins wait, we got seated.  Gordon Ramsay posters and TVs are at every corner.

The music and background was so loud! May be we're too old for that... so we only ordered 2 burgers, finished and left right the way!

Mushroom burger -  the mushrooms were so favorable and patty was cooked medium rare.  The meat still juicy inside and the bun was fresh! Hell's kitchen burger - avocado, oven roasted tomato and medium patty also cooked perfectly. 

Both burgers were huge, we just barely able to finish it.  We need bigger stomach for fries and shakes next time!"

C7g-TDJ4xg00xRvfspt1Xw,2,"I've come to this restaurant once before and their food was amazing. Pricing is great and the service was so so. My last trip here, I was very disappointed. They had changed their whole menu and ingredients. I was also told that they don't serve burritos here. I was confused. I'm from California and the last thing a Mexican food place lacks is it's burrito selection. By the time you get your low quality food, you're not hungry anymore. Our sever didn't care that my group and I were dissatisfied she just rolled her eyes at any request from us. It's sad because we considered this little place a hidden gem. Boo!"
zrCiOlMIK5qdAOYB6THK0g,5,"This is my kinda place. A creepy staircase leading up to a hidden shop with
interesting finds galore. The staff has great taste in music, and the shop specializes in underground and avant garde. You'll also find a good selection of metal, jazz, and an odd assortment of used records and CDs. Prices on new stuff seemed to be $1 or $2 cheaper than anywhere else. I picked up a couple of Severed Heads re-issues, Tame Impala live versions,  another copy of the Top Secret soundtrack for a gift, a handful of 80s 12"" singles and an amazing 2LP Pye Corner Audio which I overheard in the store. 
Will definitely be back."
JWP5i_Eggz49jzfBEh3muA,1,"Sat in the drive-through line for at least 15 minutes, you could hear the guy on his microphone talking junk about everybody that was in the drive-through service was super slow and I'm definitely not coming back."
LNLkORQWyiGAgNzkJqaREg,1,"Terrible price for the location. I recommend that you look at Palladium or the Stetson as you will get a much better place for the same price or less. When I moved out, they charged me $700. My place was immaculate when I moved out as I am not a pet owner. 

They also run out of Guest parking passes the first couple of weeks and if you don't go in to get the current months pass, your friends car will get towed! 

Look anywhere within a mile radius of this place and you will be getting a better deal."
kaam3iZe4G_5vEpKetk3VA,1,"Had partial knee replacement surgery December 15, 2015. Arrived in the morning and paid $295 deductible for the planned 2-day stay in the hospital. I was told that Banner Estrella requires an overnight stay for this surgical procedure. After surgery and recovery I was assigned a room on orthopedic floor (6th floor). PT personnel came to my room and conducted an extensive therapy session.  I had dinner served to me in the assigned room that evening.  I told my surgeon that I felt really good and asked if he would discharge me.  He had the nurse make sure I had meds from the hospital pharmacy and I was discharged that evening.

Six months later I received a bill from Banner Estrella Med. Ctr. for $1,684. After numerous calls to my insurance company and Banner, I was told by Banner that the $1,684 charge was due to the procedure being classified by them as an ""outpatient procedure"".  A procedure, I might add that cost a total of $71,565.  Had I stayed overnight like I was scheduled, there would have been no charge - doesn't quite make sense - does it.  If it was going to cost be $1,684 to have my doctor discharge me early - shouldn't someone from the hospital have told me that. Given the option of paying $1,685 to go home that evening or stay overnight and pay nothing - I certainly would have stayed overnight.

After numerous attempts to get their billing people to review my situation I was told it was turned over to Patient Relations and that I would be contacted in a few days regarding the matter.  I have not been contacted and on July 6th I received another copy of the statement indicating that I owe $1,685.  Still no resolution."

PLOKxNzMxmgt8MXKsFCvhg,4,"Tommy Burger is where you would go if you're looking for a 'gourmet' burger.  It really is different from other burger joints and I enjoy it because of that.

They have every f-ing topping you can think of and you can load as much junk on it as you like.  They have everything from mushrooms to guacamole to fried eggs to chili.  I would almost say it is comparable to Johnny Rockets... which is an awesome place.

The prices of the food isn't outrageous, considering how much you actually get.  I am always STUFFED when I leave this place... almost to the point that I'm ill.  I've ever actually been sick from Tommy Burger, only extremely satisfied.

If you love burgers, and you know how you like them, this place is a great burger joint.  It's different and fun!"

9cmdU5HuSP203qHHCm_B4A,1,"We used to order from KFC all the time but on many occasions, we were either shorted chicken or sides.  Recently went back today after a 6 mos hiatus and again, we were shorted sides.  the chicken tenders on one order was nothing more than hardened batter with no chicken really to speak of.  We returned back to the restaurant to complain and were greeted with hostile employees - were not given the missing sides and insisted on getting a refund on the ""chicken tenders"" that I would not serve my dog.   Bottom line - would never recommend this location. Until they can actually get good help, chick filet looks to be the restaurant of choice."
ORf2AcipZdRtZdVCiSBJEQ,4,"waiting on my oil change, i stopped by here mainly because the place looks pretty damn cool. it's like a little ramshackle shed, with lots of shaded seating areas in the back. 

you order at the counter and then pick up in the back. i ordered 3 fish tacos to go and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. and they were only 6 bucks! how cheap!

but they weren't the street taco size...pretty much standard size! and they were loaded with cheese, beans, cabbage, and fish. i was so impressed, i ate all three by myself!  
 
a definite plus and i'm sad they had to close their shop down scottsdale road closer to us. the grateful dead would probably eat here everyday!"

Within 2 hours they were at my home giving me a quote for the work.  They were also available the very next day to do the work.  I only needed a yard clean-up (weed removal, leaves removal, trimming), but they also fixed an irrigation leak, identified the location of another leak, and reviewed the settings on my irrigation module. Additionally, they haul away all yard trash.  At $180, it was a little more than I have paid in the past with other landscapers, but it was definitely better quality work and service.  I was grateful for how quickly they responded and were able to schedule me in.  I would recommend giving them a try."

I28h_MAEh3NOPa8ph5mEbg,5,WOW. Just saw the Las. Vegas Tenors here and I'm speechless.  What a great show.  These 3 guys got this harmony and accapela music together.  They nailed all of the great songs that they sang for us. This show is the best I've seen in quite awhile here in Las Vegas.
oONW4qvzU9pb-4ZWJC4qtQ,1,I came in looking for bohemian hair today and the customer service that I encountered was less than acceptable. The gray haired sales associate was not happy with showing any type of hair and I was not given an opportunity to look at any of their product. I asked to see a very specific hair I was interested in and was told that it wouldn't suit me even though I was previously shown that exact hair and it had fit my hair perfectly. She was rude and very unhelpful as for I walked away without a much needed purchase. This is the second time that her service has driven me out without help.
BZeSurQyylYfUKX-ZG5Imw,1,"Just left this store and I felt so disrespected and he's lucky I wasn't in a bitch ass mood honestly . I went here to get beer and a bottle of alcohol but I needed to pee really bad. So me and my friend went to the bathroom before grabbing the alcohol and right when I sat on the toilet he comes pounding on the bathroom door to come out !!! So before I can even pee I get my ass up ! I open the door and he is yelling at me like I'm a little ass kid telling ME I need to ask to use the restroom !! So I leave but I come back and tell this guy he sounds dumb and needs to put signs like other places NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS or you need a key to use it !
He tells me that it's an employees bathroom only yet when I walk to the back they're is no signs !!!
So please whoever the owner is fire this guy or put signs specifically stating the restroom is for employees !!! Or you need to ask before using !!! I will never go here again especially because the worker was so rude and unprofessional !!!! 
Do not go here !!!!!! You will be treated like crap"
xYyLMOXwAkgPtLoob12SDw,1,"Avoid this place. They do not care about customer service, nor do they back the products they sell. I bought my girlfriend a over priced vape stick for her birthday here.. and of course when I gave it to her, she didn't like it. After taking it back to the store still sealed in box, with receipt 6 days after purchase, the minimum wage queen who was working the register denied the refund, opened the sealed box because she couldn't understand why it was being returned... after telling this person 10 times its BRAND NEW, NEVER USED she still kept asking is there juice in the unit.. she still denied the return. Bottom line, I don't have time to deal with places like this due to shady stuff, so I simply take my money elsewhere.  After some research I found out this particular unit was $30 bucks more expensive than anywhere else.. so I caution each and every one of you to price check this place.  Ripoff, Horrible Customer service, and bad attitudes. Now I buy my coils, juice and other vape stuff somewhere else. They do not deserve my business, or yours. You have been warned."
3TaKdrpMkUsA1UI-gtxzxQ,3,My first visit...I was not happy with being seated where dishes were emptied...close to kitchen. Aside from that My waitress was fantastic great service and wine selection. The food was served hot and freshly prepared.  There was a lot of food could not finish all of it. I will return but not sitting same table a few over would be great.
dEGOIE7aR5C92wWJjIrchA,1,"I am not sure if this place can even be called a 'university'. It's merely a for-big-profit corporation hiding under the label of an education institution and, worse, a ""Christian higher education"". At the core, this is a place where share holders are the customers and the students are the suckers who've deceived into giving up their money in exchange for some bogus degrees. We brought our daughter here to check out the environment and walked away feeling happy that we decided not to send our daughter there. GCU curriculum is designed by corporate-minded business people - not real educators. They have people on their rosters as 'professors', but in reality, these guys are just robots following instructions from pre-made course material. This is not education. This is a degree mill that produces bogus graduates  in much the same way Phoenix University does. The bottom line: I would not waste my money in this deceptive scheme of an enterprise that hides under the fake label of education."

Definitely worth a trip or two for your gift and smoke concerns, enjoy!"
o6sX-w-l1lpaJKjbI3JM3Q,4,"*4.5 stars* (I'm getting really mean with my 5 star reviews)

Within approximately 5 minutes of entering Bang Fitness I was flat on my back on the turf while a bearded man palpated the bony prominences of my pelvis. And you know what? I liked it. That's not because of a case of pogonophilia (Google it-it's real!) but because this was Geoff, the owner of the gym, and he wanted to see if I was physically OK to do the class I'd signed up for. Somebody actually cared enough to ask about injuries and experience before just taking my crumpled deal voucher and running.

They say they do things differently at Bang, and that was evident even before I first arrived. I had bought a Groupon for classes, and in typical fashion left it until it was near expiry to use. They were prompt in answering emails and after a few failed attempts I eventually made it in for my first class. I was a bit confused by the setup intially. It's on the second floor and I could mainly see an MMA gym. It turns out that the MMA bit is on the left and Bang is in the same space on the right after you round the initial corner. You have to take your shoes off when you walk in the door and in the changing rooms so I erred on the side of caution and brought indoor shoes. You can often work out barefoot or in socks too. 

The strangest thing about Bang is the people who work there. They're all incredibly nice and friendly. They learn your name and remember it. They know when you've been in and what you've done. They notice if your form slips and correct it. They increase the intensity if it looks like it's too easy. They are all super enthusiastic about getting you moving well and avoiding injury. It's like physio and a kick-ass gym combined. I felt like I was being welcomed into a family!

Most of the classes I did were with Steve-kettlebells and Friday morning kick-ass conditioning. I absolutely adored and still adore these classes. Sizes are generally small (max 12, often less). They are always challenging but always fun and you absolutely will get fitter. I will probably always maintain that it's a good idea to actually learn some basic kettlebell techniques before trying a class anywhere; but they do correct form at Bang. The KB class is usually 5 exercises for 3 sets; then a second set of 5 for 3 sets before tabatas. Izumi Tabata is a Japanese researcher who was part of a group that came up with the bright idea of trying to kill you for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 cycles. I looked him up on Google images to see if I could get revenge. He looks innocuous so I could probably take him. I'd have no hope of taking Steve down unless he tripped over me. He's a strong guy. To be fair though, they're worth doing-they've been proven to increase conditioning. And the guys here are all about the research. 

Kick-ass conditioning is different every week. I just love it because I never know what to expect. It's circuit style and I've done stuff like hit a tire with a sledgehammer, I've pulled and pushed a sled, done box jumps, slammed medicine balls and carried a keg.  You never know what's in store but it is always fun and it is always a great workout. It cures any inner rage. Steve is funny and the time just flies.

I did one Olympic lifting class. I was terrible but Ron was lovely. He was so patient, the class was small and technique was heavily emphasized. It's a pity it just didn't fit with my schedule to go to more.

I did one circuit class with Andy on a Monday which was different again-band work, kettlebells, lunges. I knew I'd been working the next day!

I decided on a trial month which included a programme and 3 semi-private coaching sessions. They do a full assessment on you including a functional movement screen and devise a programme to fix deficiencies and help towards your goals. I tried some exercises I had never done before and got lots of useful tips and corrections on things I'd been doing for a while. I'm even trying to put my shoulders down where they should be while I type now. My nutrition consultation was mercifully brief-I basically said I knew I was eating badly anyway. We discussed more habit-based nutrition tips which was nice and has made more of a difference than if they had just handed me a diet plan and expected me to stick to it. As if! I'm excellent at ignoring diet plans. 

I ran out of space to say more but agree with the other reviewers (also read filtered)!

At the moment, my plan is to sign up for a class card because it doesn't suit me time or money-wise to get membership. I'm not willing to leave the place yet though and enjoy the classes far too much to not go again. And I'm not usually a group exercise type! Definitely go, check the place out. Do a drop-in class, have a look around, consider a trial month. Doing things differently is exactly what is needed!

(P.S.: Surprise bonus was checking in on Yelp and being informed that I was the ""Duchess of Bang"". If only Yelp awarded certificates..)"
I20XOU4SvQTMyE2latI_sw,1,"This was the worse nail shop experience I have ever had . If I could give them 0 stars I would . My nails look absolutely terrible . I should have just walked out when I saw the tech's hands, but for some reason I still sat down . First things first, she didn't remove my gel properly ... she had it soak for like 20 mins and it still didn't even budge . There was still spots of polish on it when she started, but I was getting virtually the same color so I let it slide . She didn't soak my hands to do a manicure and she didn't clean my nails properly before adding the gel . My manicure looks terrible and she didn't clean up the edges nails at all . The paint is uneven, has bubbles in it & is all over the place . I asked her to fix it multiple times and she said she would but never did . On my feet, she didn't give any type of massage at all . She just poured oil all over my legs and then wiped it off with a dry towel . The towel left lint on my toes, which she didn't clean with alcohol before she tried to put the gel on. The clear base layer was uneven, had bumps in it,  and there was towel lint on 2 of my toes (which I pulled out myself because she said she couldn't see it). I brought the rough base to her attention before I dried it and she ignored me multiple times even after I pulled my foot away to stop her and show her what I was talking about before I put my foot in the dryer . The colored polish looked extremely streaky and started to clump and bubble as she put the first layer on, because she didn't clean my nails with alcohol first before applying the gel, and she just kept trying to paint over it . She just kept saying ""it will even with next coat"" and I explained to her that it was the base coat and she ignored me . I was there for over 2 hours and I left completely livid . My tech was the only person who was there when I left so I couldn't even ask to have it fixed or re-done by someone else. To top it all off, I saw that she was taking the cotton balls out of the foil that she had used on my toes and SAVING THE FOIL !! That was completely disgusting and unsanitary and I was repulsed . I hope more people will contact the BBB about this place like so will be doing ."
gkoT0YHsGhQUN7Vr2TbXaw,5,"It was just AWESOME!!!! Great new restaurant if you like natural beauty to surround you, great atmosphere, awesome service and amazing food! They have just mailed a great atmosphere, you could bring the kids in the day time, and live it up there in the evenings. I plan to use the private dining floor at some point. It can be used for anything from a dinner for two to a huge event like a rehearsal dinner or huge party. We had a party of five and ordered salads, sweet tea chicken sandwich, omelette and the shrimp. There were no complaints from our whole group. The server, Alicia was very knowledgeable about menu, responsive and recommended great wine. The owner came around to greet us and was very sweet. We will definitely come again. The only grow point would be the wait in between appetizers and the entrée. I think we waited a while, but the atmosphere was great, you almost don't even notice!"
0tqQkaf8_xgnQVPXMWsfHw,4,"Anti-pasta salad was delivered with out dressing.  If you going to play in the delivery world, it has to be perfect every time.  The appetizers that I ordered my kids were mediocre."
mg6kkYVZ9lvqRbMwUk4iqQ,1,Awful customer service. Ordered at the express to go line and dealt with a girl named Viera who clearly needs customer service training. Extremely rude and not helpful. Took over 25 mins to get my to go order. Multiple staff members standing begins the counter talking and texting instead of helping customers. Awful experience. Have been to the restaurant sit down area many times and have never had these issues. If you are going to have a to go area in a restaurant it should run quicker and more efficient and staffed with people who have a personality.
qIycBgOURjrTiirCXQzKZQ,3,"The best part of the entire thing, for me, was seeing the sea turtles in the final tank... where it feels like you're in a sunken ship.  I like the theme it had, but as far as aquariums go it wasn't anything special.  We paid for admission through a discount package bought over at The Luxor which included admission to an IMAX movie, their corny ass motion simulator ""ride film"", the king tut recreation museum, and shark reef.

The self guided audio tour is pretty cool,. but they talk about a Tiger shark with these massive teeth... I figured that'd be the coolest shark to see.  No go... didn't see a damn one, despite spending almost half an hour just in that section listening to the audio information while starring out at the fish.  

Sure it was a bit more worth it than the Dolphin Experience over at the Mirage and the same price, but nothing exciting if you're not overly excited about your typical aquarium."

HsHPvgiQGFtvtyVbcRTXkA,2,"I'll start this review by saying that I have eaten at Vegenation a total of four times, I have ordered: The vegan burrito, the east west tacos, the burger, & the biscuits and gravy, and the buffalo wings.
Pros: I think the environments of both the restaurants (downtown & Henderson) are beautiful and clean. The service has always been great at both locations. Also, Vegenation supports local businesses and stands for great things that align with my progressive values.
Cons: I just don't think the food is that good. I often eat Vegan & Vegetarian, but I have never been wowed by the food. 
The buffalo wings have been the only saving grace, the vegan burrito was pretty mushy and could have used another element that provided texture, the taco was overly sweet, and the biscuits and gravy were nearly inedible (biscuits were great, gravy was gross!). 
Keep coming hoping that my mind will change, maybe sometime I'll try a pop special and enjoy it. I keep holding out.."
gVXIsoi1OOsyVvicnX-wWQ,5,"Facial. Not the kind you get on a Friday night, either. Heh.
Kristen gave me an amazing facial! She wanted the experience to be relaxing, and when she saw my eyes opened, offered to put a towel over them so I could get the most relaxing experience possible. 
She likes using products that are more naturally-based than chemical. Even gave me some tips on things to use from my kitchen to use to cleanse or moisturize. I even went through the things I use currently at home & she told me the pros and cons of each product.
Her scalp/shoulder massage was so divine, I told her she should get licensed in massage therapy.
First time clients get a deal: $40 for a complete facial!
So, it's worth the drive. Ask for Kristen. Go. Go now.

We ordered the cheese toast (best thing we had) one of the oxtail toast which I thought was just ok. And the pot pie which was way too salty. We had the panda cotta for dessert which was really tasty and I would get it again but I wasn't a huge fan of the Chantilly whipped cream on top. 

It was a little pricey, but I guess that's to be expected at a tapas place. Just wish I'd liked the food a little better. I'd try it again."
TCe69z182cH9hfeuft5mnw,5,"I haven't had a lot of luck with finding a regular place for waxing - until I moved down town and asked a friend who lives in the area for a local recommendation. 
I was SO happy with the services I received. I was able to book my appointment online through their site quite easily and received confirmation both via text and email. I had a half leg wax and armpits, we started at 10:15am and I was out before 10:30am. The aesthetician was quick and thorough and friendly but not overly chatty. 

REALLY IMPORTANT POINT: they use a new stick every time they dip into the wax, which I was really happy about. Very hygienic. 

It was an above satisfactory experience! They are currently running a promotion and before tip both services together came to $28.95 before tip. 
Additionally there is a loyalty program, so when I let them know who recommended me, she received 5points equal to $5 on her loyalty card, and my services were kept track of in their customer database and I gained points as well. I can not overemphasize how happy I am with my experience at Prayosha."

My husband is Italian and we just moved 2 years ago from Milan to the States. Portofino was by far the worst Italian restaurant we have been in a while.They try to modify traditional Italian plates to a more sophisticated version putting a high price label on it. We had the lasagne which was burned, cold and with ingredients that don't go with it. The spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste. The gnocchi were warmed up and not fresh at all.
The atmosphere is snob and tries to attract the rich ones thinking to find a great Italian spot. There are better places to spend your time and money.
One star because the wine was good. At least they know to choose the wine."

We parked right at the front door & it wasn't until we got back to our vehicle that we realized we were in a pay parking area. But the deal is, it's $5 for the whole day. You park then go to the parking attendant & pay. So try to arrange your schedule so you can hit up several places in the strip to take advantage of this great parking deal. The shop itself is ok. There was 1 artist's work on display...she made things out of combs & human hair. Needless to say, it was different. There are other items for sale but not in our budget. There was an artist working so I was able to chat w/ him about his craft. This store is close to a Peace Love & Donuts loc."

On the day of she was a great help in giving us enough time to set up and accommodated our last minute requests with a smile. We were able to go in before it was open to the public so we had the space to ourselves for a bit.

lLd2A-X_6TxtXxFpJpQIdA,1,"My partner and I were looking for a good brunch place and we saw some really good reviews for this place so we decided to check it out.
I honestly am really unsure why this place got the good reviews it did. It looks okay when you walk in, modern decor, clean setting. But both mine and my partners food were very, very unsatisfying. I ordered home fries, two eggs over-medium, whole wheat toast and coffee. The only thing cooked to order was the home fries- but the ketchup they gave us was over a year expired. Yuck? My eggs were heavily salt and peppered and over-hard, my toast wasn't even toasted. It was just slightly warm bread. And our coffees were a sickly sweet hazelnut, which neither of us had asked for. We both left disappointed and unsatisfied and walked to the Starbucks down the street to get ""better"" coffee. 
The service was okay, though it was unclear if we pay at the register or the table, since our order was taken at the table but there was a sign saying you were supposed to order at the register. Confusing. I wouldn't recommend."
mRCIWZu9EhZUi-WCv8pEig,3,"After shopping at Mekong the family decided they were hungry.  I thought we were going home, but NOPE!  So checking to see what was nearby I spotted this place with 4 stars.  And it was just across the street!  So we put the groceries in the trunk and walked over.

From the outside it looks pretty ordinary.  A neon sign tells you that you are there.  It was very crowded when we walked in, but a booth was open so we grabbed it.  Within 10 minutes there were even more people and some had to wait for tables to open up.  I figured this was a good sign.

First impression:  slow service. Dive.  Shabby interior and it took a while to get the menus.

Extensive menu. Lots to choose from.  Which is cool.  It took a while to go through everything.  Even then it took a while for them to take our order.  They probably need a third server, at least during dinner.  The wait was unreasonably long.

Once ordered it took a reasonable time for the food to show up.  At least assuming they are cooking it fresh (which I'm assuming).

The food:  big portions, simple but good flavors

I can't really rave about it.  It was good.  We were all happy with our choices.  Mine was supposed to be spicy (it had the red pepper symbol on the menu), but it really wasn't.  It was still good, though.  Was this ""as good as it gets""?  No.

I could probably go to 4 stars if we hadn't had to wait 20-30 minutes to take our order.  It only took 10 minutes to go over the menu, and they didn't check on us at all until at least 20 minutes.  Food was tasty, and portions were large, but the wait was excessive."

U7wJ5tvRKmdEzJpHgLKlPA,3,"I love the convenience of 24 Hour Fitness and the different club options. I visit this gym twice per week out of necessity, it's on the way to work. I have mentioned the cleanliness issues multiple times to the front desk, but the issues persist. Mildew in the showers, dirty walls, dirt rings in the hot tub, etc. I understand that this is an older gym but there is absolutely no excuse for unsanitary conditions. It's obvious that the management and staff have become numb to their surroundings, unfortunate. I'm hoping someone at the corporate level will take the time visit this location and see what everyone else sees. And, yes, all of us talk about it. The hairball stuck to the glass in the pool area, near the hot tub, has been there for close to a year. We may even miss it if they happen to clean it off one day."
mFLJAzXCZmsMAUoLr-CZqw,4,"I've been to HnJs in Vegas and both of the ones in Arizona now and I must say that things are pretty consistent!  Service, that Hot n Juicy sauce [I'll be tasting and smelling of this for a couple of days], and even the decor are all the same.  They even send in the same pretty lady to all their stores to help gets things off the ground given by what she has said at their Tempe grand opening.

Anyways, I pretty much always order the same items:  Hot N Juicy crawfish, lemon pepper shrimp, a basket of their cajun fries, and their oysters.  Their oysters are always a gamble though since you can never tell when they're fresh until you actually bite into one.  After the past few hit-and-misses, I think I'll pass on their oysters from now on.  They are currently serving frozen crawfishes as it's not in season so I say hold off until summer if you can.  If not, they're still big and plump but nothing beats fresh crawfishes.

This is such a great and prime location for Hot n Juicy!  Now the west valley folk can get their fill of seafood and the Tempe location can be all mine... MINE!  Best of luck to HnJ!"

OH3AypcAhgsZkUMA1fFOiQ,4,"I met my niece, her mother, and family here for dinner since it was almost halfway between Midtown Phoenix and Chandler.  What a great place to have a fun dinner.  The burgers are well stuffed but not massive.  It would have been better if I hadn't eaten the whole thing but I was starving.  

My niece and I both had the three cheese stuffed burger.  Neither of us like cheeseburgers but having something between two layers of beef (or chicken) makes it taste very different.  

My sister - in -law had the Hawaiian and really enjoyed it.  My niece's husband enjoyed the mac and cheese stuffed burger.  

The fries were crisp and tasty.  The shakes are beautifully presented.  I didn't have dessert but everyone else enjoyed their ice cream in a variety of ways.  

It's definitely a place I'd return to.  If you live in or visit the Mesa area, add it to your list."

Ordered the haymaker brunch meal - food portions were incredible small, bacon tasted awful, eggs seemed undercooked, and the restaurant doesn't allow for you to substitute out one of the side items. Service was good and the location is great; however, doesn't make up for the awful food.  If you're looking for a quality brunch, walk a couple blocks to either the famous toastery or the Rhino Market."

dmSMUrO5Ml36ah_CMrEG2w,3,"Meh, I've experienced better is a perfect sum up of this.

We waited for about 15 mins to be seated.  Had a couple more minutes to wait for drinks.  

I ordered the goat cheese, tomato, spinach scramble (I think that's what it was...)  BF ordered smoked salmon scramble.  

They got to the table, portions are huge and presented nicely.  I started to eat the fruit  and was looking for pepper for my eggs when I realized there was ham in mine.  Hmmm.  Not what I ordered.  I ate the fruit and biscuit.  Both fine.  The potatoes were actually pretty good.  Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I liked them.  No waiter to check on us at this point.  I decide to at least try the egg mixture on my plate.  Kind of greasy.  Just okay.  Tried the BF's salmon eggs.  Same thing.  Just okay.  Though he did have the pleasant surprise of a bone in them :/

Finally waiter comes by asking how we are.  At this point, I am done eating.  I have eaten enough carbs between the potatoes and biscuit that I don't want anything else.  But I tell him everything is fine, except what I got was not what I ordered.  He looks, ""oh, you are right"".  Yeah, I know that.  ""Do you want me to go switch it?"".  Um, no.  I have been here 15 mins and have already filled up on other stuff.  ""You sure?""  Yes.  ""Was what you did get served good at least?""  Seriously?  Um.  It was okay.  ""I am sorry about that"".  Yeah okay.

Another 15 mins we get the check... No relief.  Seriously?  Then I was annoyed and just wanted to leave... 

It is fine for what it is.  Take the reviews to heart here and don't expect greatness.  Just large portions and good potatoes."
7CDmSZ17ZoG4wAmN-_2eEA,5,"I came here because I love Aveda and whenever I go to an Aveda salon my scalp doesn't hurt during or after my visit and my hair becomes thicker and healthier than with any other product out there. I saw Christi because I was told she is good with blonde and she did not disappoint! She listens to me and what I want for my hair as far as health, color, cut and style and both times I have seen her now I leave with hair looking and feeling better than I imagined!

The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable so I would recommend them not only because they sell Aveda but because they are all wonderful and talented stylists!"
2vmqilRdST06CGp5e30cZQ,4,Excellent wings.  We like the hot ranch variety but they are all good.  The wait staff is fast and nice.  They explain all the options. Get a basket of the home made potato chips! Yummmm...
Xar7Jl4zxYMBpofTIPDpJw,4,"Great store with open aisles and choices.  Was a Fry's shopper for a long time but got tired of product and displays clogging the aisles.  Winco is huge and has a unique lay out but once I figured it out, all is good.  If you bring your own bags, it makes that process much easier.  Most times when there is a long line, additional registers will open right away."
54xPPNzAG9qRXsQ7vRo6jQ,3,"If you know what chilaquiles are do not order them here. The chilaquiles dish here are essentially nachos. Hard tortilla chips and toppings.

I also ordered the pancakes which were delicious and the maple syrup was good as well. They are very filling and are a good shareable size. 

Restaurant was clean, service was okay."
CDcVF62ve5QEHZDSHclbCg,4,"I like to consider myself as a bit of a burger connoisseur - yes, such a thing exists! I will search far and wide (though, I'm not sure that's the actual expression) for a great burger. I've heard many a tale of the great Village Bar burger, that uses the power of steam to cook their burgers. But it is a mere dive bar, surely you don't mean that a cash only location such as this has mastered the art of frying a burger. Aye! I have tasted its divine glory! Now, a burger that can make me feel like I need to write in the style of a medieval knight on an epic quest must mean it's a good eat (I hate the medieval theme so much - it just happened, I'm sorry).

Back to the burger. I don't know quite how to describe the 'moistness' of the actual patty - it wasn't that it was 'juicy' because often juicy means messy. No, this was something else, burgers can easily get dry if you cook it too long, this patty was far from that, in fact it was quite the opposite. Top it with cheese and place the pickles on the side (thank you - didn't realize I needed to ask without pickles, glad to see they weren't served on my burger) and I think I just enjoyed what everyone has been raving about.

The Village Bar - you a quite a vintage little place aren't you? I'm not particularly fond of dive bars, but they had so much classic memorabilia displayed in the table that made for a nice little search and discover during my wait for food. They also have plenty of tvs (even some flat screens) to watch the game of your choosing. I must say, I was annoyed that they don't take cards, though I'm sure my review won't be changing that anytime soon - at least they have an ATM accessible inside the bar.

There is just something about that burger that will have me stopping in again and bringing friends as they stop in town for a visit. For that reason, and that reason alone - The Village Bar has earned all five of my stars that I have to give."

9SobgQutnEPvf52N3ghI3g,5,"This review is for my consultation I had today. From the start of the appointment process everyone has been extremely welcoming, friendly and efficient. The reviews for this place really baffle me. How someone could think Dr. Saxe isn't personable is beyond me. Yes he is to the point and brutally honest but that is his job. He's not there to hang out with, he is there to do an amazing pain free job. Funny thing is after my appointment I met up with a good friend and mentioned my consultation to her. I found out today she went to Dr. Saxe last year for her wisdom teeth and highly recommends him! All the girls that work there are very sweet. His dental assistant Cynthia (I think) was so caring and explained all the forms to me. Deborah who works up front was so helpful and understanding with my previous nightmare at my first consultation at another practice. The benefits coordinator is AWESOME! This office ""keeps it real"" no bait and switch. You know what you are getting and total cost before you leave. I will update after my procedure  but I know it will be 5 stars."
vkn272LeRSkxAc966gUlcw,3,Food was good. I can't say the food or service did anything different that distinguishes itself apart from other ramen places. The one thing that stood out to me was how they made their Calamari Tempura. It definitely was not the traditional version of how most restaurants make it. I had the Tonkotsu Ramen Noodles. I would come back with my family and gladly eat here again.
LDr13WaPafzcgyN1hEyXJQ,2,Make sure you have a reservation. The receptionist was very rude when I just walked in for a pedicure. When I apologized and told her I didn't realize one was needed she was told me that they don't require them but that she didn't have any openings. She was hardly apparently apologetic. Extremely snarky. I won't make a reservation to come back.

M5_4sGRyiVx2VCCpghuWmA,5,"I've been interested in trying Andrea's for sometime now after seeing her elsewhere on Yelp. Tried to get an appointment last Saturday but she is normally booked solid on Saturdays but I was able to get an appointment this afternoon after work.

Glad I did.  For sometime now, I have not been happy with the unprofessional way that area Hair Stylist treat their customers and in many cases, expensive haircuts that were no better that someone just starting out with little training.

Not the case here.  Very professional and a true perfectionist.  She took what little hair I have left and worked miracles on it.  I got more than my monies worth today.

Good service and a great job for a more than reasonable price.

Next time, since I like getting my hair cut on Saturday because traffic on I-77 can be unpredictable during, I'm going to call ahead and get an appointment.

If things continue like they did today, I've found a new place to get my hair cuts."

Even as I entered the property, I felt this wasn't the Palms of 15 years ago. It felt sad. The Palms became that casino the cousin Eddy took Clark to when he down and out."

D1ZVU5uS8jWLRy-uH1u88A,4,"We've gone to Bachi Burger twice now with each visit we've made to Las Vegas.  It's an interesting menu, as the burgers are asian inspired and if memory serves, share a combination of savory and sweet in some form or another.

The first time I ate here last year, I tried a burger off the menu.  The beef was very tasty and the quality and freshness was undeniable.  Would I have made a burger like this at my place?  No.

The second time I ate here, which was last week, I requested a ""regular"" burger which wasn't on the menu because I wasn't feeling like having savory and sweet, and they obliged.  Again, perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The food does take awhile to come out, especially if you're in a large party, so don't expect anything ""express"" style.

It's an enjoyable enough place if you don't mind the wait.  They're usually very busy.  If you're hankering for a more traditional burger, they'll hook you up with a smile. 

No complaints about this establishment.  It's in the ""take it or leave it"" category for me."
fRgTWl2h7pE5Lqtq2tC34g,5,I have now been to Sunny's Diner 4 times in the last month and I cannot say enough good things about it! The biscuits are completely heavenly and a great alternative to a toast as a side. I have gotten the Greek Skillet twice and I am so in love! It is not greasy like you would think it would be and the homemade tzatziki sauce is fresh and delicious. Today I got a side of chocolate chip pancakes with my Greek Skillet. Yum! My friends have gotten biscuits and gravy and eggs benedict and The Supreme French toast with bananas and strawberries and whip cream and all of them are exceptional. There has been a wait each time we've gone which just goes to show you that it is worth the wait! Today they were obviously short-handed but everybody maintained their composure and delivered friendly service with a smile. Even the manager was on the floor helping and was Incredibly courteous and kept his cool during the rush. the portion sizes are generous and we've always left with leftovers! I am so happy that it is right down the street from my house!

UPDATE: Since purchasing a home and leaving the complex, they slammed me with over $500 in fees. Prior to my move I went to the office twice to ask what needed to be done to prep the apartment for our departure. I had carpets professionally cleaned. I purchased new blinds for one room where they were damaged. I was up front about everything because I did not want to get drained with fees. I was told everything was fine. HA! Then they lost my check when I paid the fees and sent it to collections. Luckily I have records on my side."
tfHG4Oho8thN3PeBgfkfYQ,5,We had a great time here! Took my staff here for a staff family day and everyone had a great time. Our favorite part was the laser tag arena with so many levels and hideouts! Makes you feel like a little kid again but with adult appropriate arenas!
_2vcG63RYWzU6vVjXfnvQw,5,"Delicious food and excellent staff make this small French restaurant worthy of five stars. We began with a glass of fabulous wine that we brought (it is byob) and ordered the onion tart as an appetizer. The taste of the leeks coupled with the cheese, buttery and flaky pastry made this one of the most tasty ways to start a meal. I ordered the marinated chicken. This dish came with a juicy chicken breast with a light pesto sauce, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. The flavors intermingled to create a sensuous bite, time and time again. My girlfriend got the filet, which was juicy and flavorful and came with perfectly roasted potatoes and tomatoes. For dessert we ordered the tart of the day, which was fruit and coconut cream on top of a shortbread-tasting tart. Just delicious. The service was wonderful, very efficient and friendly. It is not cheap, it was $99 for the appetizer, two entrees and dessert...but for the experience and the exquisite flavors, I will go back for any special occasion... guaranteed."
jXRrPrmxELLa_Iw2NnPaow,3,"I so love Pita Jungle - we have eaten at nearly every location over the years, have used their catering menu for parties and business functions by our calculations we have eaten at Pita Jungle more than 500 times since moving to the Valley 9 years ago. 

Unfortunately this location does not live up to the quality we expect from the franchise. 

As vegans we have limited options in dining out and Pita Jungle has built a strong reputation as a company that caters to vegans and vegetarians alike. But not at this location. 

Back in the spring we ordered take out only to find pieces of chicken mixed in with our tofu - I talked with Christina the GM and she assured us it was an ""anomaly"" and couldn't happen again. Still we avoided this location for 6 months hoping the problem would get resolved over time. It didn't - we went back again last month and I ordered a veggie garden wrap only to once again find pieces of chicken mixed into this vegan dish. 

This time I took pictures and sent them to Christina and the local manager Mary - they completely ignored my emails so I posted them to their facebook page. And once again they claim it is an anomaly. Reading other yelp reviews it seems like this recurring anomaly is now the norm at this location. So we avoid it like the plague."
tEUUTkmq5Va_4HuqlrIYYA,1,This place is horrible I took my car to get the water pump replaced and I left the car drove worst it started shaking making noises and the electric system in my car is not working properly. The guy was nice and talked a big game but I left out of there with worst problems and I called them and they said oh well it's going to cost a couple more hundred dollars to fix it. I just don't understand why the car drives worse than when I brought it in. Don't go here.....

FrGoBJtyfVvQjvchoLbyog,3,A definite reason to make a trip off the strip when visiting Las Vegas. It's the Small places off the beaten path that seem to have the best BBQ. From ribs to pulled pork nothing wasn't delicious.
gwnM8vRkZBSOji1IBYRtdg,2,"we had a nice time in your city UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING.  
WHO in their WRONG MIND decided that it was good idea to close the Las Vegas strip for over 6 hours this past Sunday, December 4, 2011?  The rodeo finals were in town, the cowboy christmas, the michael jackson cirque immortal tour was openning, there was a big fight and so on and so on....the city was packed! 
Your city will be really lucky if nobody missed their shows, dinner reservations and flights out on Sunday afternoon.  It took us 2 hours by tram and monorail to get to the Mandalay Bay.  With a lot of walking too....in HIGH HEELS as I thought we were taking a Cab.  But, alas the cabs never left the driveway.  Persons heading to the airport were told it would take upwards of 3 hours to get to the airport.  I imagine a lot of people were missing flights.  People were walking in the middle of the marathon and blocking the races.  The marathon ended at the back entrance to the Mandalay Bay at the same exact time that the Michael Jackson show let out.  Thankfully chaos did not insue, because we would have been lucky to live though that.  The place was crowded to the point that children who are claustrophic were crying near us.  And, I don't know about the racers.  I imagine they were pretty tired.  Hope nobody collapsed becauser THERE WAS NO WAY IN or OUT.  We were stuck.  It took almost an hour to get out of the Mandalay Bay hotel.  There is no reason for this to have happened.  There are plenty of streets in Las Vegas to hold the Marathon on that would not have caused this much insanity.  Wow...urban planning dept and police and special events should be trained or fired.  This was atrocious."
5_XMYnZ9ruPBRGhEpJoFHQ,5,Brand new next to the newly opened Frys Marketplace.  This area has seen a lot of wonderful changes with new restaurants. Lots of choices for neighborhood and having a Burger King here is great for a quick bite.
zuUQsqHzAxyo6u-IbKJiUQ,4,"It's not enough to say they have the best happy hour in North Scottsdale - and, oh, they do - let me tell you why.  First, the place looks so good it makes even me look good in it.  The entrance is a long walkway surrounded by floor to ceiling windows behind which are hundreds of wine bottles stacked, well, floor to ceiling. The staff all ooze cool while at the same time executing some of the most solicitous service I can think of in town right now.  Their signature cocktails are amazing, and their bartenders know just the right way to make them.  At $8 a pop during HH, that's a mighty fine deal for top shelf liquor done right.  Food is $7 on the HH menu, so of course we tried just about every one, and they were outstanding.  Ok, I have to fess up, the lobster mac & cheese was really boring, but that was the only boring thing this evening.  I guess they have live music some nights, and I hear they're thinking about offering bourbon flights.  Bourbon flights??  That's a bit beyond my league, but it could be fun to watch.  

Best of all, Bourbon Steak's HH goes until 7, which gives me plenty of time to fill up on the value menu and still get my old butt home in time to crash at a decent hour."
-fnO92d6j0_kr449FEwqFg,4,"MAGH...I should have brought a second water bottle.

First time on this trail today, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. ( I put on a tough face and didn't whine.)

I am not super athletic like my MIL, who does marathons (st. george this weekend), and my guy, who does TRI events and what not.

We parked off of Horizon, and were alone, except for this young couple in their white car, making out and getting ""it"" on..They either didn't see my SUV pull up (which I doubt), or they didn't care.......Awkward.

Other than that, we did not see anyone else on the trail the two hours that we were out there. The ""switchbacks"" on it can be quite steep, and the gravel, sand and rock(s) are quite loose. You must be very careful with your footing.....and watching out for snakes, and wild life..... (duh)

Through the steepness, and elements of the walk, I sucked it up and made it through. I prefer Bootleg over this trail... but maybe I will get used to it.

The kids in the white car where gone when we returned."
evfAdXEAwzEutedxPhKQNA,4,"I have now visited La Mestiza twice, and I can't say enough good things about this place. We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. 

The dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited ""ooo""s and ""aahhh""s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.

The restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.

Finally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant."
p3TyzZZzwC9MKhVfqm5-yQ,4,"This is inside the Cosmo in Vegas and a little different than his other Jaleo locations or at least DC.  This is very Spanish and a tad more upscale.  It is mostly small plate tapas so good for sharing.  Great service.  Food comes as it is ready, not as ordered which is typcial for tapas.  Great options for meat, veg, seafood.  YUM!!  Enjoy!"
JM2ZmYeEOnhP0YSjkrYXRQ,5,"We just got back from there showroom and went through the entire purchase with steve and Pete and I must say we couldn't be happier with our used purchase, our office only needed 15 cubicles and some chairs but the pochiro brothers made us feel like we mattered where the other companies in town couldn't be bothered with our smaller sale. If you're tired of feeling like a small fish in a big pool this is your place to be where you will be appreciated.

Thanks steve and Pete for the new office Furnitre!"
fdlucJWGE_a4La7UhBow5Q,4,"I go here because it's very close to me. Really it's the wifi that brings me in, but I always get a cappuccino too. The cappuccinos are done well, small cups, not too much foam, etc., with excellent flavor. Their baked goods are very good, for the small selection they tend to have. They are a bit on the pricey side though, but maybe that's just Calgary. It can get very busy, very quickly and there isn't a lot of seating, especially when it's cold out. The space layout is a little wonky too, but it seems to be good for socializing.

It does have the best cappuccino that I have ever had. Perfect size and flavor, and the pastries are good. There's a reason it's so popular.

What blows me away about the place though, is how popular it is. What I mean is, where are all the people coming from? For 40 years that little strip mall was dead, nothing really stuck, except for the small convenient store. I'm super happy Monogram is there and doing well, I'm just still in awe every time I go and see so many people. Better late than never, I suppose. Oh, they have excellent morning hours of service, even on major holidays they're open for a little bit in the mornings."

rGmLHMOfGoq8bZXJ03xxuw,3,"We ordered delivery from here one night. Their website is a little difficult to navigate if you are ordering traditional chinese. We called to confirm what the difference in vegetables were based on which items you selected. If you order Szechuan you get different items than if you order mixed vegetables with your choice of sauce. It would help if they just listed this in the description of the item vs. you having to guess. We ended up getting Szechuan chicken and Chicken with mixed vegetables and hot garlic sauce. We ordered fried rice instead of white rice. This didn't meet the $25 minimum for delivery, so we got an order of wonton soup. We got our confirmation e-mail saying it would be 10-15 minutes and they didn't disappoint. Our food arrived on time and it was hot. Both chicken dishes were good and the fried rice was really good. They also give you a large portion of fried rice, not the small containers you get at most places. The wonton soup was not good. It was really watery and tasted fishy. Strange. We shared 2 entrees between 4 adults so the portions you receive are decent. Give them a shot if you are craving Chinese!"
wuHnbbgiQ2uQFu226KdycA,3,"This mall is probably one of the worse ones I've been to. Its stores are alright, I like most of them.

Recently just last week Sporting Life had their grand opening and that literalli put the life back onto this mall. The Hudsons Bay recently just got a major renovation too, its now more modern and carries all the lines the Yorkdale location does.

They've also inserted an H&M and Sephora in there as well. I'm pretty upset still that they closed the boathouse outlet.

The only downfall to this mall is the food court reeks balls. It has very limited seating. Now they have expanded and brought some higher end stores they HAVE to update the food court, this one just isn't going to cut it. Also there is also limited seating due to the population of elderly Europeans taking up at least 15-20 seats during morning till someone at home tells them dinner is ready lol."
Z7UksIu_2c-h-6acnsqIsQ,5,"Obsessed with this furniture store. I've bought a dining room table, bar stools, couch, entertainment sets, pillows, and a futon from here and I have never been disappointed with any purchase. The service is also really good and there is usually always someone around ready to help you. By far the best prices from any furniture store I've ever purchased from."
iSVxwWNsprY1y5uiCZChlQ,4,"Came here twice during our Vegas trip -- once for dinner, and once at 4:00 am before our flight home. Both times I was so impressed with how good all the food was! They cook up some really unique flavors here with very quality ingredients. Servers are also very friendly, and they really go above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable. 

My thoughts on the food:

Truffled Potato Chips w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce: Ordered this appetizer since its the top highlight on Yelp, and was blown away by how delicious this was. The potato chips were thick cut, fresh, and pipping hot -- it paired perfectly with the creamy, tangy blue cheese sauce. I don't even like blue cheese but I'm in love with this dish! (5/5)  

Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers: Very tender cuts of steak, thoroughly seasoned and covered w/ their house steak sauce. The dish comes with 5 decently sized skewers, but is a bit on the expensive side at $18. (4/5) 

Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings: This dish definitely satisfied my chicken wing cravings! If you've ever tried Vietnamese chicken wings, these have a very familiar taste with the strong hints of garlic and chili. Each wing/leg was generously glazed and very flavorful! (5/5) 

Prosciutto Pizza: Also ordered this dish as it was one of the top highlights on Yelp! My friends really enjoyed this pizza, but I thought the goat cheese was a bit too strong (albeit, I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese). Regardless, I still really liked this pizza because the prosciutto gave it a really rich, buttery flavor. (4/5)  

Italian Sausage Pizza: LOVED this pizza! The contrast in flavors from the creamy ricotta, the sweet roasted peppers, and the juicy Italian sausage was perfection!! I might be a bit biased though because I pretty much devour anything with ricotta lol, but also the crust on both pizzas were cooked perfectly -- very thin and crispy.  (5/5)   

Also wanted to mention that the complimentary french bread we got at dinner was amazingly good since it was freshly baked, hot out of the oven stuff! They also threw in some garlic/onion & rosemary infused bread sticks that were super buttery and moist. The french bread at 4 am was just so-so, but that's to be expected haha"
4cON-1erWqqIlZuVu9VcLw,5,"I had to come here to get a wedding gift. I walked in and saw the computer to print out the registry. It was very easy to do. As soon as I got done printing my items, a very sweet associate named, Maggi, asked me if I needed any help. I told her what all I was looking for and she helped find where everything was. She was even trying to hold my items for me while I looked. There was one product that we couldn't find so she checked the computer system to see if it was available or not. She was so sweet! She took so much time in helping me find my stuff as well as ringing me up and packing up my items really good and putting them in a box. I felt so spoiled! I can't wait to go back to actually shop for myself! :)"
jwfGYx0Ns4nwE6rDwPOWzA,5,"Two words for this place: Holy. Guacamole.

I have I thing for trout, and if I see it on the menu, I order it. Smoked trout -- even better. I love bacon too, well who doesn't? And guess what? I love guacamole. So in comes this dish from Momocho that combines all three! So if you are into this sort of thing, I'd say it is a good marriage of spice, smoke, acidity, ""good"" fat and ""bad"" fat. This is hands down the best guacamole invention in Cleveland, if not, the world. Mind (and taste buds) blown.

Downsides: small space. crowded. 

Reservations are a must."
AaTalI3CalTxlKnvVYW0Kg,3,"Finally stopped at this place to try it. I live down the street, I was craving an omelette, so I figured great time to try it ....when I walked in I was Greeted, I wanted to place an order to go, since I had never been here before,  I I told her what I wanted.....on their menu, they have a build your own Omelette, they have about 30 items you can pick from, same cost no matter what u choose ...while I was waiting at their bar seating, the Gentleman, I believe he was the owner, asked if I would like an Expresso while I wait, which I thought was such a nice gesture ..when I received my Bill, it came out to only $11.00 which I thought was pretty cheap, when I got home the omelette was huge came with curly hash browns, and not only that, but two huge pancakes"
h9eHbFp3itHP5BHv-NJWsg,3,"Tommy V's is a fun spot for a casual relaxing dinner. I went with a group of three coworkers and it was a decent location. We have the buchitini to start and it was surprisingly small but definitely tasty. I also ordered a cocktail that ended up being way too sweet and I had to send it back. The wait staff redid the cocktail for me, however it was still super sweet so they offered to comp me for it at the end of the meal. For the main meal I had the three pastas dish which was good but nothing stellar or imaginative. The gnocchi was defintiely the star of the dish and something I would go back for. For dessert I ended up having an expresso martini which was delicious and definitely something to try.

Overall, good but there are better places in town I would say with a more imaginative menu."
Fg_ZF8UJ8945G3ihfDnA4A,1,Practically empty for a Friday night. There is nothing much else I can say. I'll give a single star for decor.
aKlFapFbsXMVpMZs5fSLag,2,"Heard great things about this place but it really didnt live up to my expectations. It took over an hour to get our food and when we got it, it was average. The soft drinks were completely flat, the potatoes were cold and the cole slaw was awful. On the plus side, the ambiance was good, our waiter was nice, the deep fried onion was fun and the ribs were tasty. I guess its worth a try but avoid going on a busy night if you can."

She has such a fun spirit about her which translates into her photographs.  All of the photographs we received were well done and very high quality.  She was able to capture every priceless moment throughout the evening.  

I would recommend her to anyone!  I know I will be using her again in the future."
cPtW3ZJiV9CSRB6tv4HO6g,1,Rude and absolutely unprofessional. My uncle came in here for an alignment after installing a liftkit and always came here for alignment tune ups. After the tune up nothing was fixed even from the previous times as well and told us that we needed new tie rods. My uncle took it to another shop and had told us they did no work previously because the rods themselves were unable to be adjusted because they were stripped. They cut the tie rods and fixed our problem. When we came back to collect a refund from them the employee that looks like Rob Schneider had the audacity to say we bought new tie rods.
e9jdech94kII87JfYvlv8g,1,"The salads were crisp with one cherry tomato, one pepperocini and two olives. Adequate for a side salad - one of ours contained a shard of hard plastic. Lasagna was horrible. Noodles and meat in the sauce were so soft you could not distinguish one from the other. The ricotta filling was dry. My husband's pasta dish was mushy. When the waitress inquired about how things tasted my husband told her the noodles were mushy and overcooked and she said ""Aw that's too bad. I was planning to try that for my dinner."" We ate the bread. When the waitress came to clear the dishes she asked if we would like boxes for our basically untouched meals and we declined. She presented the bill and then 5 minutes later came back with another bill with one entree removed stating that she guessed it really must not have been good so she told ""her"" and asked that we not be charged for the one uneaten meal. I guess you have to pass the time test - take no bites - before they believe you that it is inedible. The food was absolutely horrible. We will not be back."

It was our first visit here and the restaurant has lovely decor and beautiful rustic wooden tables. However most of the plates that were on the table were not clean and then once the waitress removed them to switch them out, I noticed at least 3 sticky/not clean areas on the table. NOT acceptable in any restaurant that has the kind of prices Basil Thai has. I chose not to say anything as we had company and I did not want to make a scene. The food was good and we will go back because of that but please, hire staff that has an eye for a clean table."

When I mentioned that I have contributed to a traditional IRA and the amount I was qualified to write off my income he told me that Roth contributions are only tax-deductible... WHAT?! I work in finance and I knew this was 100% completely false. ""Well, when I put your contributions in the section of ROTH in my spreadsheet your return gets higher.."" is exactly what he said to me. His formulas in his spreadsheet were obviously incorrect. He then proceeded to tell me that I should move all of my traditional contributions to my Roth IRA... again... what?! Does he not know the tax implications and penalties I could have ran into If I took his advice? That is not even the worst part. We decided to hold off with filing until the next few days so I had time to ""take his advice."" That following week I emailed him talking about my concerns about his advice and shared with him links to IRA tax laws and tax-deductible contributions. I told him I still want to file with him but would like to fix the issue of my IRA contributions. A few days went by and no response.. I then sent him a text and he said he would give me a call within an hour. No call back of course... I tried to call last Wednesday and he picked up and immediately said he had other clients on the line and he would call back.. no call back!? I couldn't believe that a professional would treat a client the way he treated me! I am happy I knew more about certain tax laws then he did or else I would have been screwed! Honestly I think he was embarrassed at first that he had no idea what he was talking about. I do NOT suggest going to James for your taxes. (Scottsdale Location)"

Any average Joe sushi restaurant can take shitty quality fish, smother it in batter, deep fry it and call it tempura. I take my risks and go straight to the pure raw stuff. Classic sushi and sashimi. I've been burned by this before at less-than-quality sushi establishments but takumi hits the bullseye here. The fish is fresh and delicious the moment it hits your tongue. The Wasabi is also strong and not diluted--it shoots right up your nose. The service was quick and the presentation was expertly prepared. They give you generous portions on the sashimi. I would definitely come back again. Thank you for reinstilling my trust in strip mall sushi restaurants."

EOG2eYpxWYEL9hiMmW7C1Q,5,"Five-star Thai with a food-court front.

Who would have thought that nestled amongst a Subway®, a Taco Time®, and all your other usual food court suspects, would live some of the best Thai food that Calgary has to offer (certainly that I've ever had).

The menu changes depending on what Jackie (and yes, it's actually Jackie who makes the food) has cooked up for the day.  There are usually red, green, and yellow curries, but the meat and veggie combinations are switched up all the time. It's wonderful - every visit feels like a new experience! 

They always have creamy delicious options that would be friendly towards most peoples' taste buds, but if you are in the mood for something a little spicier, be warned, they are not afraid to turn up the heat!

As far as the ambiance - well, it's in a food court, so it's plastic trays and paper plates all the way. The food is fantastic, and the price can't be beat. 

Grab a couple meals to go, take a two minute walk to Prince's Island Park, and you've got yourself a memorable date-night for under $20."

We went to the Macy's Furniture store and found a couch and 2 chairs that we loved and they were having a great sale on. We ordered the pieces on 10/10/16 and were told they were special orders and that they would be made and delivered the week before Thanksgiving. My wife called the week before to see if there was something we needed to do to set up delivery arrangements. We were told that our order had been CANCELLED!! No one called us to let us know and they surely didn't refund our $700 deposit. After discussing with the salesperson, they apologized, adjusted the price and told us we would have it in 2 weeks as a rush order. Again, my wife has to call them to check on the status of the delivery and finds out that the order now has been set for FEBRUARY. Again, no call from Macy's to let us know, we had to call them. We speak with the manager and he says some furniture companies shut down for the holidays and that may be why the delay. We tell them that waiting that long isn't an option for us and he tells us he understands and will cancel the order and fully refund our deposit. We are told on 12/6/16 that it will take up to a week to get our deposit back. Again, no deposit refund and my wife has to call to check. Then we are told it can take up to 3 weeks for the refund! Well, here we are, 12/29/16, past 3 weeks, and still no refund. Guess my wife is going to have to call them AGAIN to follow up. 

Very disappointing process overall, even if the price is right, would not recommend purchasing from Macy's."
_2h7M_2JAV9LUeUSCYo2uA,4,"This place has a cool concept and a fun vibe, + creative and delicious food and drinks. The menu offers street food from all over the globe (yes it took me 2 trips here to figure out what the streets theme was referring to.) You can go with either small plates or sandwiches, which r huge and come with fries. This time my husband and I split the bolinho, the chorizo tapioca, and the pork and broccoli rabe sandwich. The bolinho were little fried dough balls stuffed with black beans, pork and veggies and spices. I thought they had a great flavor - very smoky. The tapioca is a lot like a quesadilla but made with tapioca instead of tortilla. Also very good with the chorizo.    Finally the sandwich was pretty fabulous, the pork was super tender and very well seasoned. It was also H U G E and the fries were delicious - they come with fresh herbs and cheese. We went on a Tuesday so it wasn't very crowded. The service was great, our server was very attentive and responsive. This place is really fun and I'm excited it's opened up on Carson."

Unlike the fritters you get at other shops that are filled with an apple pie filling, MJ's apple fritters are flecked with sweetened and spiced pieces of apple (no jelly-like filling). The dough is buttery with an outer exterior of sweetness and crispness. A must have. They also throw in doughnut holes with your order at no charge.

I went with a co-worker for lunch. I Love the colors inside the place.
Vey bright!!
I got the taco/enchilada lunch plate.
It was very tasty, and honestly pretty on-par with what you would expect from a Mexican joint for lunch.
The one thing that I DO like very much is the roasted corn that they put in their rice. YUMMMM!  That's is a big time win in my opinion.

I have been to one other Plaza Bonita; in Cottonwood.
I ordered the Pollo Mole.  
AMAZING! 
I wish there was a better way to present it, as it looked like Chinese style stir-fry chicken, on a plate of chocolate soup. LOL
BUT, after I ate all the chicken, I asked for extra tortillas( which were kindly retrieved), and I sopped up the remaining mole sauce( which is sweet, with a hint of peanut butter)
I have yet to find a Mexican place here in AZ that matches a place back east called EL TORO.  Im hoping to find one.

IBhMPAQ-aeCLIp6-mn18ZQ,4,"So this review is a culmination of the countless times I've been here, and it all started many years ago when I was a student at UNLV.  

When I was a student, the proximity to campus was fantastic.  And I don't know if it still exists, but there used to be sneaky-ninja parking behind the restaurant where I parked my car regularly and was never towed.  I am sure I went at least an entire semester without paying for on-campus parking because of this sneaky-ninja space.  

Also when I was a student, the affordability of this place and the fillingness (I'm not sure if that's a word but you get my meaning) of the meal was super appreciated.  

I can honestly say that I do not have any recollection of having bad service here, whether drive-through or dine-in, and again, that's going on many (many) years of coming here. 

The food always tastes fresh.  While the actual menu items are limited, the 'styles' are varied.  Check out the not-so-secret menu (per your favorite internet search engine) and you'll know what I mean.  

Me, I'm a tradionalist.  Double-double with grilled onions, light on the sauce, with fries and a Dr Pepper easy ice.  When I'm looking for a tasty burger-and-fries, I will default to this tried-and-true In-N-Out burger."

The selection of toppings is awesome and you earn free yogurt cups. The $5 special they do once in a while is great.

I walked in and was quickly greeted by Ed, sat down and showed him a picture of a lob as I wanted to even out my angled bob from December and needed to get rid of split ends. He gave me his opinion of the cut and told me it's an awkward length and will result in my ends flipping out for a while but will grow out nicely and settle down. I appreciated this as some stylists don't tell you anything and let you get a bad haircut!

I think...I'm pretty sure that I fell asleep sitting up during my hair cut, it was a pleasant experience and he spent a lot of time perfecting my lob making sure all the ends were even and perfectly styled. At the end he showed me my perfect lob in the mirror and said again it's an awkward length again assuring me it will grow out and look better, I told him I think the length is fine and I love it anyways! Ed is very polite and professional and I am already planning to come back to try a colour service:)

Make sure you book an appt in advance as it's a small salon with only a few chairs and 2 stylists."

KMJG3Puj_WUmGbaZzq8unw,1,"Good afternoon,

I was viewing online prices and ran across this dealership. I looked at a Suzuki Boulevard C90 and was interested. Their price was 8000.00+. I went to Kelley Blue Book to verify the price. KBB price for exceptional condition with bags; 4000.00+. I asked the online support why the price difference? I understand markup and making profit.... This though was gouging.

She referred me to the Internet Manager. The INTERNET MANAGER stated she didn't know about my internet search but hers showed a price of 11,000.....

An INTERNET MANAGER for a retail car/motorcycle dealership that doesn't know Kelley Blue Book???? WARNING, WARNING, WARNING. At this point I had decided to not deal with them as they are either lacking competence or looking for people not to do their research. I was going to leave it at that. 

Then the General Manager sent an email asking if my questions had been answered. Here is my response.

Eric,

I did receive an email from your internet manager. It was professional but completely lacking merit or an answer to the question posed.

Here was the question: Why does the 2009 Suzuki C90 that you have on the website cost 4000.00 over the Kelley Blue Book valuation?

Your internet manager apparently doesn't know about KBB as she stated ""I can't speak for your search, but when I looked online for a reference on pricing independently from ours,""

Even using the guide that she stated ""NADA"" with the option of saddle bags it comes to a high retail price of 11299 with an average of 8368 and a low of 6388.

Your manager states deep discounts. There are none even based on the guide she's using, your selling at the average and passing it on as the deep discount based off of the high side. All this while not even taking into account one of the respected pricing models for cars/trucks/ and motorcycles.

Sorry but your dealerships lack of knowledge of one of the most respected and well known pricing guides by your internet manager, trying to pass off deep discounts while selling at the average price (even from your own price guide) and previous poor ratings (as they seem to be inline with this conversation) have made me realize your not the dealership I want to do business with.

Respectfully,


BEWARE!! BEWARE!! BEWARE!!"

I could feel whiteness taking over but kept trying to let it pass. But you guys want people to sign up for this, apply for this, credit doesn't work for other debit, aka it takes so long to check out that I had to go sit on pavement. I asked for somewhere to sit and the guy said there was nowhere. So I ran to the cement outside. Someone came to check on me. I was not doing so hot and nobody offered me water! I asked for water (which much to the hilarity of everyone I tell this story to you charged me for) I tried to pay again and got dizzy so had to leave before passing out. I ran into the poles outside and was somewhat injured. You guys would not just take my card and made me come in again. Now it's not your fault that I was dehydrated and honestly I had no idea till at your register. However, you guys let me leave, charged me for water, and only cared to get me a chair when it was sat at the register so I could pay you. I've been shopping at cost plus for decades and was pretty disappointed. I like your stuff but you don't care much for your customers."

Often with a tasting menu, the dessert is an afterthought and not really worth it; so we were pleasantly surprised that the kunefa (?) a sweet cheese pastry was so good. 

Our host was second generation Syrian and was a delight, his wit and explanations added greatly to our enjoyment of the evening. Would heartily recommend this restaurant."

I'll be honest, I'm not crazy about the place.  The house band is loud and pretty cheezy IMHO, but everyone else in the world seems to enjoy 'em.  The bar is always super packed, hence next to impossible to get a drink.  And the prices are pretty hefty for being just a shitty little bar.

Why the upgrade?  Well, on the Tuesday night I went, it was pretty empty.  My friend and I found seats at the bar and had a very friendly bartender who was able to assist us in charging our drinks to my friend's room at Harrah's.  Kind of a cool Harrah's perk, I guess.  Great place for people watching on the patio, too.

I hope the employees don't think that because they can't make a mistake on the food 98% of he time that they can't be friendly and polite. 
They wrapped all our food to go, but if they were to ask us hey would of known it was for here. We got a burrito and a bowl, both were good but when they places my husbands burrito in the bag, all the juice and heavy parts few to the left side of his burrito, so now that they wrapped it evenly, it was now pointless because they put it sideways in a bag. I always love chips and guacamole, but why is that ever chipotle I go to, my chips are stale? Do they not make the chips there are bag them each day, not just whenever they run out of bags? Besides that, there was no smile from any of he employees, there was a thank you from the cashier but it was like a thank you and I don't care kind of thank you."

If they are ""so"" busy, why can't they just call and let you know your food will be late?!  I have had it with this place.  Cold food, stale rice, rude service. Not worth the money or hassle anymore. They don't listen or pay attention to the special comments section when you order online.  They don't care or cater to food allergies. The health dept should take a visit to this place.  They would probably be shut down. DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!"
rO1ZiDUtGnTTgypWMBuIuw,4,"A Vegas local hidden gem. We have been coming here for years.  The western is my favorite but there is nothing on the menu that isn't awesomely delicious. 
The prices have gone up a bit, and the lines can be a bit long.  But it's worth the money and worth the wait. 
Go, You won't regret it."
X9wBQAoQqJRzfHnASlttyQ,4,We've been to Tod's Hot Dogs several times when in the area.  Simple menu so it is easier to decide!   Everything is charbroiled in front of your eyes.  Prices are reasonable.  The place is quite clean as are the restrooms.   Help is friendly.   All in all a nice place for a quick snack or dinner.
r_Fc95bp1Dj57wARz6heaw,4,"It's White Castle and since there none in California and you need your White Castle craving you might as well stand in line and eat your steamed sliders.   It's located at a smaller casino called Casino Royale which is sandwiched between the Venetian and Harrahs.   Some people love these sliders, I'm not a big fan but my boyfriend loves them even bought a 10 pack to bring back to home.   They sell packs of 10, 30 and even 100."
PcP6mbZT0gsXBcxjAZqQjA,3,"This place is, average. It used to be my favorite Mexican food place, but their prices have increased for no apparent reason. My last visit was a bit disappointing which has earned it the 3 stars. The food was mediocre and the service did not exceed my expectations. If I have to find you for more chips and salsa, there's a problem."
a4ApQ8D5rbbhKvGZUD21aQ,1,"A huge red flag here.  

I hired Inks Installation to do a roof job July 28, 2015.  I found multiple problems with the installation.  The roof valley lines were cut uneven and the alignment of singles were off.  What I found the worst is nail heads exposed on a shingle that has a two inch strip showing where to nail.  Something this simple makes me wonder on how the whole installation was done. 

I thought the owner, Mike Inks, would like to know the quality of work his men were doing so I called and had to leave a message.  In the next two weeks I called everyday leaving messages with his office. Now the office must have my number because I cannot get anyone to pickup the phone.  What a piece of work this company is. To top things off I checked this company out before hiring them.  I found they were recommended by  Owens Corning, the shingle manufacturer, have a OK rating with BBB and are on Angie's List.  How does that happen?

   I am now left with a roof with exposed nail heads and a warranty from this company that is totally useless.  Think anyone else when looking for a roofer!"
P4PhvJtGEAomcX7hnqvfRg,5,Good taste! Just recommend! I and husband think the best Korean-Chinese restaurant in Vegas. (It's Korean Chinese. Make sure NOT ordinary Chinese restaurant!!) Try 'Cham-pong' if you like seafood-spicy noodle.
JDco8qtyumIdZcmgQvAKgQ,1,"Are therapists here paid only with tips? As I was not happy with my massage I only left $10 which, in my opinion, is already a hefty tip for something I didn't enjoy. Then i was already leaving and the receptionists stops us and lectures us why we should tip more. That was extremely EMBARRASSING as the lobby was full of people staring at us. I gave an extra $5 and the therapist grunted and snatched it away from me (without exaggeration). They were nice in the beginning but show their RUDE side if you don't tip 40% or more. They even have huge lighted signs around the building telling you how much they should be tipped. I thought that was a little too much. 

I went in for the full body massage. It started okay then ended really rough. Walking on backs is not a new massage technique but this was not done well at all. This was not the first time I had this done on me either. It was too rough, too much pressure, and extremely uncomfortable. I did let the massage therapist know that it was hurting but he only stepped slower. I notified them a SECOND time and there was no change at all. 

The hot rocks BURNED my back. They never did a temperature test. I told him it was too hot and he only took it off for a few seconds and continued with the burn.  I have had hot rock massages before and this was the worst one I've ever experienced."

FINALLY!! Received response!! HE feels his works is ""PERFECT"" and he could have never made an error.  He also INSIST that I place a claim with the Ohio Dental Board, he even offered to place complaint himself?? Never did I expect him to be COCKY about this or UNPROFFESIONAL but I will take his advice and do so.  I also seek some legal advice regarding the matter and will be placing a small claims case with Avon Lake Court. Good thing we own three homes and one being in Ohio still so a visit will be coming..

BTW: 
Dr. Douglas Voier also did NOT like the fact that I made this HONEST review regarding his crown work on Yelp and Google. In his refusal letter he sent me he mentioned the review, so apparently this bothered his EGO a bit."

A gentleman by the name of Michael Reed who is the service manager assisted me. Michael was very attentive and kept me informed along the way about what my car required or didn't need right now and gave me a very good price for the work that was done. He and his staff were very courteous and were able to expedite my repairs in a fast and efficient way, I would have no hesitation to go back again to this location for any future work required for my car or recommend this shop to other people.

DLe0CR5qWYi4XJBTwqShMQ,3,"My husband and I went to Fort Mill Ford to trade in my car last Thursday, and purchase a newer used car. We had a car transferred from the South Blvd. location. Our salesman, Keith, was very knowledgeable and helpful. Unfortunately, the description of the car online said that the car had a few features (moonroof) that we realized the car did NOT have when we went for the test drive. Still, we were happy enough with the car to purchase it. When we sat to sign the papers, I was only handed one key. Our salesman said he would call the original location to find out if there was a second key. When I went back the next day to pick up the car, he told me that there was not a second key. When I asked him how I could get a second key, he called another man over, who explained that their dealership could not cut a second key because the car was originally from a sister dealership. Then he continued to explain that if they'd given me another key, that would put them in competition with the sister dealership. If these dealerships are sharing cars, then how can they be in competition with one another? Finally, he said in order to get a second key from them, I should have demanded that a second key be given to me before the sale was completed. I should have made it a ""make it or break it"" thing with the key. I felt like that statement was unprofessional. Even after all of that, the key they actually gave me has a battery that is dying. (I've had the car for less than a week.) If a customer is spending almost 20k on a car, the least the dealership can do is give the customer two keys. This is petty. Now, I have to spend several more hundred dollars to have a new key made.

**updated** The general sales manager, Bob Jones, called me directly and helped me get a second key, free of charge. So, I bumped the rating up from two to four stars. He didn't have to go out of his way, but I'm glad he did!"
7ui1NeMAnwzLv_ZEPQOOHQ,1,"I was told we are having a happy hour at Chili's.  So I found out that Happy Hour is only at the bar, not anyplace else.  So I went to the bar and ordered a gin and tonic.  The bartender asked me if I wanted a particular brand.  I told him Saffire.  My drink came with a bill for $9.06!!! I thought we were in Happy Hour.  I was told that it did not count with called drinks.  I was very unhappy since I wasn't told that called drinks do not apply to happy hour.  

Make sure you ask about their non-sensible so called ""Happy Hour.""
I think I should have been told.  Instead of paying $9.06 I should have paid $3.00!!!

I am not going to eat at Chili's ever again.  I'm also telling all my friends and relatives."
H_NM5PmL0C9742gPy5lYpQ,5,I visited Suenos for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I felt like a kid in a candy store.  They offer an excellent Dia De Los Muertos inventory and a great selection of other authentic Latin American crafts.  My favorite buy was a couple of vintage Mexican movie posters - I can't wait to go back and dig through the collection for more.
b1Uh26C8XRXM0f0NXRaaDg,1,"Where do you want me to start!
1. worst customer service ever... The middle age Hispanic woman was incompetent and did not have the basic customer service skills to work the front counter. 
2. My party stood waiting to be seated. After 6 minutes of waiting, we finally sat ourselves. (by the way we grabbed our own menus) 
3. Once we sat and realized the middle aged woman was not going to come to our table to take our order. She then yelled across the room to ""come back to the counter to place our order"" (side eye)
5. At the counter we were met with hostility. We couldn't understand where this hostility was coming from (it was my birthday and I just wanted a pie)
6. The pizza came out SALTY! (see other Yelp! Reviews)
7. The wings were broken and freezer burned
8. I ended my birthday with heart burn and heartache! (not to mention her POOR customer service)
NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT AT THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A FAMILY RESTAURANT!"
fF82fnusvt8QMcj4WsXHfQ,3,"Never had any problems. Only issue would be that the parts manager Andrew J, please don't talk to me with that huge wad of tobacco in your lip and then spit into your empty cherry coke bottle. Not very professional."
-RThe3sc4v8z4QgHaz2OhQ,3,"I loved the atmosphere, and the service was great!  But our food was so-so.  Our waiter kindly treated me to a birthday dessert, but took away our food before we were finished in order to present it, forgetting to ask if we were finished.....guess that's one way to make me save room to eat it!  
The atmosphere was great, and the beer selection was amazing. The burger was good, the pizza was average."

6GnoLCvfa29gXrTTyV2yiw,3,"There was so much hype about this place - from the tv interview back in Jul 2014 of the owners on bikes offering their pastries downtown before the place first opened, to the features on blogto and the like, to the pictures all over instagram - that I was thrilled to finally try out their Sunday brunch. My sister had warned me it would be $54pp. The site doesn't say and it's been awhile now so I don't recall specifics, but it was around there.

The food was alright. In the pictures on the site, it looked much more grand, like an endless display of scrumptious entrées and desserts. The reality consisted of two sections: one for diy omelette, pancakes/french toast & toppings, roast beef, salmon wellington, sausage/bacon/etc; another smaller one for wraps, salads, desserts. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad. It's just that there was so much expectation coming in that I was surprised i wasn't blown away. (At least it wasn't like at Maman where I took one look and walked right out!)

The service and decor, now that's what makes up this place. The café is located under a condo but when you walk in, it's as if you're transported to Paris. (Or how we romanticize it in our heads.) The decor is absolutely beautiful and the ambience alone makes it worth visiting again. The service is impeccable. I've never had someone change my plate so many times during brunch or check on our table so often without it feeling like i was watched like a hawk, but we felt well attended to. I guess that's what you get for the price?"
h-QXd2IgiPTWXg4pVn7ZtA,4,"Great movie spot.  They need to put a kiosk out front for people that don't want to wait in line for a movie though.  The small talk with everyone that buys a ticket kind of slows the line down.  I say the movie, give you the money, print my ticket, and NEXT... I don't need all of the small talk.

Clean bathrooms, and no sticky floor issues whenever I go.
They have a membership card that offers you discounts and free movies or concessions.  One of the best theaters in Charlotte.  Just speed up the ticket line on Friday & Saturday nights."

But besides food, I also want to say that I really appreciate the service that night. It was a full house as always, but everybody, especially the manager May, was very nice and helpful, which gave us an even better dining expereience, and that became the awesome start of our NYE celebration in Vegas."

It's scenic but not a joggers ideal setting. Nice place otherwise!"
uA1v1rIhuza6s20mG_dROQ,5,I've eaten here dozens of times and I must say it is one of the best restaurants in the downtown area. One of the specialties there is the escargot and I strongly recommend you try it if you get the chance to go there. The waiters are absolutely amazing and very friendly. We see the owner there almost every time and he always makes sure the service is always up to the highest standards. Amazing place! Great food! Good pricing! Strongly recommend!
7J_w0FGd5oyc0bh4U1Q3Mw,4,"J'ai commandé le ceviche pour emporter. J'ai trouvé que le poisson avait un ou deux jours de trop au gout. Mais pire encore était la minuscule portion de ceviche par rapport aux garnitures. J'ai ouvert l'emballage et découvert 2 immenses feuilles de laitue iceberg avec une très épaisse tranche de papaye et une montagne d'oignons blancs crus et quelques feuilles de coriandre hachée sur le dessus, sans huile ou lime ou vinaigrette quelquonque. Quand j'ai soulevé ces gigantesques et inutiles décorations pour découvrir le fameux ceviche... c'était une minuscule portion de sole pas vraiment fraîche coupée grossièrement et mal assaisonnée.  Pas de coriandre, pas d'avocat, pas même un peu de pico de gaillo. La seule raison pour laquelle je leur donne plus d'une étoile, c'est la façon dont ils ont sans rechigner accepter de me rembourser."
f03dobpyh24MWkFVnEM0uQ,5,"Prime burger was exceptional, from the moment we sat to the time we received our meal.   We went here for our first dinner in Vegas after a very long day of travel.  We purchased a groupon for the restaurant which is really the only reason we ate there the first day.  Our party of four ordered two Americanos, a Big scorcher, a fungus hummugus, cheese bacon fries and drinks.  

Each and every one of our burgers were juicy, properly cooked and of good size.  If you are not very hungry you can easily split the burger and fries with another and be satisfied.  The cheese fries were crispy, very cheese and the bacon pieces (not bits) were plentiful.  We loved all our food.  Our server(Ileana) was very attentive and kept our drinks filled...to the point where my children were raving about her filling their glasses without even noticing.  

I highly recommend Primeburger.  We enjoyed it so much we ate there again after having a horrible experience at Chin Chin in the Ny Ny hotel.  On our second visit, we arrived an hour before closing and the meal and service was just as good as the first time."
aGFhuDM_VtvNkOuKYNBWrA,5,How can someone give 1 star to this restaurant. This is the second time and the service are great with well manner. The food is amazing and the beer I'm having is excellent. Even the bread they make are beautiful. I will definitely come back again!!!
Ff5JssM3xwxo32wlN-zRwA,4,"This place semi impressed me as it's hard to go wrong with warm woody lamp lit tones and a stove oven. 

Now, I DIDN'T order a pizza...I know right. If my gluten intolerance would give me a break that would be very different. Considering it is a pizzeria, I had to hope for the best in the case of my dinner. Usually these fancy extensive butter using European based places will fill you up with just a salad. I got some big green salad which turned out to be rather literal with the word big. So good too. By the end I was ready to break. After that we got fries and  ""crispy"" green beans. Yep, both really great. The fries are a little different just warnin yuh. The green beans really hit the spot and gave me something to take home. 

Everyone around me got pizza and I don't remember anyone saying it was anything special. The woman beside me ordered ribs. And oh.my.god. number 1: they took longer then the rest of the orders; number 2: the dead thing was HUGE and on a cutting bored. She could barley slice it. The side of beet chips were great but that's coming from a vegan, hippy, healthy, anything-vegetable-including-grass-goes person. 

The service was pretty good and the whole feel of the place was great. It's small though. One big table for a big party and the rest are pretty much date tables. It's a warm atmosphere and all that and the wine list was pretty good as far as I could tell. 

They didn't seem to know how to maintain the temperature which can really throw you off I think....

All in all, I think it's a hit or miss but in the end, it's just nice to walk outside after dinner and be on Roncesvalles."
WH0gcZcybstxzr0APZ42Bw,5,"Went to my first of many Winterlicious adventures today.  The line-up includes: Trevor Kitchen & Bar, Biff's Bistro, Midi Bistro and today's all-star dinner at Reds Bistro & Wine Bar. 

Winterlicious has been a tradition of mine, like Christmas, lol since 4 years ago.  I have had my fair share of good and bad experiences.  Reds Bistro has reminded me that Winterlicious can be a positive experience, net of any condescending treatment that we're paying a cheaper price to experience fine dining.

I arrived early, and was seated promptly by the hostess.  It wasn't before long before my Andrea arrived.  Since I had already read through the menu prior to arriving I knew exactly what I wanted.

I ordered the Foie Gras & Chicken Liver Parfait to start, the Roasted Venison Chop as a main, an the Chocolate & Raspberry Panna Cotta to finish off the evening.

When the bread basket came I was excited that they were serving warm bread!  I hate nothing more than being served cold bread at a restaurant.  It's almost like they're saying ""We know we could serve it warm, but it's too much effort to pop it in the oven.""  There were two kinds, sesame and white bread.  The sesame bread was too chewy.  I felt like I was going to get lock jaw just trying to eat it.  The white bread was great, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside... Ah...

The Foie Gras & Chicken Liver Parfait was an explosion of flavors.  It was served pâté-style with a cognac gelée and a berry compote.  It was very velvety smooth, and the cognac gelée was very tasty! The crackers that accompanied the dish were very light and crisp, nicely buttered with just the right amount of crunch.  The combination was ingenious!  Andie had the Butternut Squash & Sweet Potato soup with Duck Rilette.  I didn't taste much of the duck, but the sweetness of the sweet potato with the smoothness of the butternut squash were irresistible!

Our entrees were very savory as well.  The roast venison chop was done medium-rare, perfectly seared on the outside, and just pink on the inside.  This is how I prefer most steaks or game meats done because I find anything more well done than that comes out tough and too chewy. The venison was very tender and the fleur de sel that topped it off added a certain je ne sais quoi.  It was served on a bed of apple and sauerkraut and roast potatoes.  The roast potatoes were yummy!

The dessert was a little disappointing.  I expected a panna cotta, you know, the custard-like-jiggly-creamy dessert that you've had at Italian restaurants before?  I don't know what I was served, but it was definitely not a panna cotta.  It was not quite soft or airy enough to be deemed a mousse... It was more like a hybrid between a ganache and a mousse.  I would say that the dessert was the most disappointing part of the evening, but the appetizer and main were so good that in the grand scheme of things, it didn't matter all that much.  I think that Reds Bistro is one of the better restaurants to go to for Winterlicious, as the food was fairly portioned, and extremely appetizing!  I will definitely come back again.

NB. For entertainment purposes only - We sat at a booth behind a table of cougars, very Sex and the City minus the glam and youth, lol.  They were all totally doting on the server who was IMHO pretty cute.  Think, Samantha when she was at RAW and met Smith Jerrod, it was one of THOSE moments."
8xRv4sM09lNWUn29FsbMhg,4,"I've seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows over the years and this one is now my favorite. From before you enter the show, the box office is surrounded by lights and a store that display Beatles gear.

For tickets, I would recommend getting the cheapest tickets. We did and I thought our view was very good. We were seated in the middle at the very top row. It's a circular stage so as long as you are in the middle you will be fine. If you are located near the walkways of the stage, you will be blocked by the curtain at times. There are also discounts available; we got a discount for ordering online through our corporate discount website. Don't forget to look for those discounts!

The show is 90 minutes long with no intermission. The acrobatics, (Beatles music), effects and acts are mesmerizing. 

Beware that no photography or recording of any sort is allowed."

PY7g77l5UlT85Pco1XtgEA,4,"I decided to stop at this Albanian diner on my bike ride today to try something new outside of downtown Madison. Overall, I thought it was good but not outstanding. The sausage is very good and as you can see from other posts recommended by a number people.

The one thing that I really like about it is the number of healthily options for a diner. Sometimes that's hard to come by but they make it a point to be a bit healthier."
-ep4NIA9_YXSlc2emblXlQ,5,I called Christmas day for my Mother who had been broke down and stranded on the highway. After giving the gentleman I spoke with on the phone her information he informed me that they would take her car to my house for free. He said Merry Christmas and when I arrived home her car was in the driveway. It is great to know  that companies and people like this still exist and we'll be sure to pay it forward!!!!
G7JtzhQYftS-qnuSJtTRUQ,5,"You cannot go wrong with the $9 lunch buffet. So reasonably priced and the food is unreal!! The samosas we so crispy and tasty. Since I did the buffet I got to try a little bit of everything and it was ALL fantastic! Ended it was some killer rice pudding and Gulab Jamun (the sugar milk ball things)...great price, great food. I was in heaven. And not too busy on a Saturday afternoon which was nice."
yi5cENF1BqHHHn7fMofW_Q,1,"Worse customer service! I have been coming to this place for YEARS. I have brought so many people here and use to recommend it to everyone. Not anymore, for the past 2weeks I have been trying to get a message. I would call at 9pm and they either tell me no more tonight or we closed. One night I even showed up at 10:30pm and they turned me away. Keep in mind I use to come at midnight with no problem. Not only that but they expect you to pay a certain amount when you tip. I am all for tipping but when it's earned. I will not be returning."
k2YSmaLD8IQU9Z9S5rvmAw,4,"I really like this place overall, very lively (we arrived middle of happy hour).  Really inventive menu. Had brussel sprouts for an appetizer which I never thought I would and they were, in fact, delicious. Had their kale salad and topped it with salmon steak which was Perfection. Their fried chicken is good, it looks like it's over cooked, but it's not, it was really juicy but it's kind of sticky. Mashed potatoes and gravy were okay, but kind of surprised their coleslaw was a little plain given that everything else was so flavorful.

Did learn a lesson - if you order drinks, wait till they arrive before you order your food. We ordered cocktails and they did not show up until we were 2/3 done with our dinner, not the time I usually enjoy a cocktail. Cocktails were delicious, but still the flow of service wasn't really in place. However, our waitress was nice and accommodating and the manager came over, they comped a piece of their yummy banana cream pie. So definitely going back just now know wait for drinks, then food."
n4VHKyIm4vq9XvsfHRI4fw,5,This place is unbelievable. Tony was our waiter and I can not tell you how kind and helpful he was. This is what a waiter should be like in an amazing restaurant like this is. The portions are perfect. I am full and still want more. Can not wait to come back to Vegas to come back again.
9TQAngiUJaXf11tGJebMuA,3,"I have given 4 stars as the food and setting is great . Had dinner here and the young man explained the menu and was very attentive, decided to try brunch today ... food was good service sucked ... no spoon for the coffee , waitress checked in once waited a long time to place order....impression I received was that serving was beneath her and she was doing us a favor ....she definitely does not belong in the service industry."
Yiz28nV5UDXjfZNxNqrAZw,4,We are used to eating healthy so everything here is a great selection for us. Pleased with everything we ordered! And kids eat free (from the kids menu) on Sunday's. Perfect for a place to come after church as a family. How nice! :)

Dexter was very nice, informative and listened to my concerns. He made sure I received the current promotions. The shuttle service dropped me off at home while my repairs took place. The work was finished quicker than expected and the shuttle picked me up although it was after hours for that service. Great experience. I'll continue to get my car serviced here. As someone who practically grew up at a car dealership, I have high expectations and they are always met with Chapman."
svVoGLAVb8na4tI0JOJ8pg,5,"Thank you, Okra, for introducing me to the Vieux Carre! I am in love with this drink. I actually made a small batch version and gave it as a gift to a fellow whiskey lover this past holiday season. No worries: I told the recipient to go to Okra: the inspiration. You keep me coming back for more: I dream of working my way through the cocktail menu... I want to try them all!

I seriously love the cocktail menu here because it introduces me to such a great variety of drinks: traditional and original. 

Food-wise, I highly recommend: 
the mac and cheese balls 
the country ham & hoe cakes
the pimento burger - my current choice for best burger in the Valley!"
UjB-FwMR7IHicU3l5e83Ig,5,We came from California in the search of this famous sandwich! It did not fail to impress us. It was fast and inexpensive but so delicious! Staff tried their best to get around to everyone but they were bust both times that we came in. It was worth it though and will be back if we are ever back in town.
Urk589Xjx3cjgkOBuUwhrg,4,"I didn't have their famous burgers, but my carne asada burrito was very tasty. It was busy at lunch, which tells you a lot about the place: people like it. You won't be disappointed."
6LqKD3xHFrh8dmHSUNql0Q,5,"My new favorite restaurant in Vegas!

I ordered the margherita pizza and my husband ordered the baked lasagna - both exceeded our already high expectations!!  It's hard to live up to the authentic characteristics of a true Italian margherita pizza and this place did it.  The crust was crispy yet fluffy fresh in the middle, thin bottom, sweet and fresh roma tomatoes, ample amount of fresh mozzarella, topped with fresh and large pieces of basil.  I want more!!

The lasagna from initial reaction was rather small in size when presented in the bakeware.  Once you dive in, it was power packed with flavors from the meat, cheese, flat lasagna noodles and sauce.  Unbelievable taste.  Served with a small arugula salad.  

For dessert we had the zeppoli - my God, this was amazing.  The chocolate drizzle that you dip the donuts in was mouthwatering.

I also ordered a red sangria - perfection.

Everything about this visit was flawless.  We will definitely be back again.  The atmosphere is fancy but not too showy or intimidating.  The views are just as good as The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  

Woohoo Giada!"
HPgh9aDRxIuwuoJZov5C2A,4,"Hong Kong Wok is one of the Asian fast food sit-downs that my friends and I had frequently dined at. 

I appreciate the cheap and semi-authentic menu items here, and they aren't bad either. My favorites dishes here are the beef with scrambled eggs, the beef fried hofun, and the lemon grass chicken. When I'm in the mood, I also dig the congee varieties that are offered here.

I'd say most of the dishes at Hong Kong Wok are under $10. It's fast and it's pretty decent compared to other Asian restaurants in Madison. I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place, but give it a shot at your own convenience."

I wouldn't come back, I suggest you go somewhere else where you can get more for your money. Other than that, the store was adorable and had cute nick nacks. Would probably try a smoothie there."

Love the hydromassage. Much cheaper than LA Fitness, where I didn't use the basketball and racquetball courts or pool.
Planet fitness is more for the leisurely gym goer, which is great - obviously if you want more hard core you go other places, but for what it is, planet fitness is great. If ONLY they didn't have to subject me to FOXnews and it right wing propaganda, I'd have given them 5 stars."
AnYyHJjngFVfUvdBkbD07A,1,"This restaurant is awful. Staff is extremely rude, inattentive. Food mediocre. Restrooms are filthy. We went on a Saturday night. No one would even take our name for over 20 minutes. The wait was excessive, the place was unorganized. Everyone was very rude. I was there a year ago and experience was decent but after tonight, we will never return."
a-wm43drnGfI_YQvF9dhKg,3,"Having been to other excellent Alley locations in the Toronto area, my expectations for another Alley store is a bit high.

This is a really small store, with barely enough room to stand if there's half a dozen people waiting for their orders or hanging around to chat or other activities after receiving their drink. Fortunately, the sidewalk along Yonge is huge and they have a couple tables and seats set up outside. However, I can't imagine what things will be like once the cold weather rolls around.

The person taking the order did not seem to have a very efficient process figured out, which included taking the orders, sticking the order onto the cups, handling payment, and scanning the rewards app. Sometimes the people making the drinks would mess up, and then he has to do damage control, which means the order process is delayed even further. This likely contributes to the long wait times from the moment you line up, to the moment you receive your receipt.

Scanning the rewards app was also particularly complicated, as he takes the phone to scan with the tablet and then returns it to you. The first time he did this, the rewards didn't go through, which led to me interrupting the order line so that I can get the points added to my account successfully. I don't know if they can check whether it went through or not but it's pretty sloppy.

I ordered the alley trio milk tea, as I had enjoyed it at a different location previously. A large cup is $6, but it includes 3 toppings, one of which tastes quite fruity. The drink itself felt and tasted quite watered down compared to the one I had before which had a richer consistency (more milk perhaps). Toppings were alright, but I'm expecting a much more satisfying drink at this price-point.

I'd rather just go across the street to Palgong and order a classic milk tea for $2.99 which comes with tapioca and a more comfortable seating experience."

Unfortunately there was no room for desert.  Maybe next time!"

I went in to have my eyebrows waxed as a first time client I explained to the lady that I DO NOT want them thin ! That I just wanted them cleaned up around the arch . I have spent 4 months of growing and shaping the perfect brow in my opinion . She replys in her arragant , broken English ..""ooo no no I know what I doing u no worry "" there was her first mistake ! Not only did this witch take off my eyebrows to a Ronald McDonald golden arches she also burned my skin and got wax all in my hair !!!! I was so mortified I paid and ran out of there when I got home I assessed the damage ! My skin was burned because the wax was to hot ! I also had to pour baby oil in my hair to get the wax out all stuck in the temples of my hairline ! My brows were uneven , thin and all around HORRIBLE! I returned the next day and requested to speak to the manager I asked him to come out side .I told him of my nightmare and said I wanted my money back ! He agreed that my brows were uneven and the skinned was burned by the little scabs ..He spoke in viatamesse to the lady and they start yelling back and forth . He tells me she said she never did my brows and acted as if I just randomly walked in the shop asking for money !! I told him I was going to call the police and show them my receipt and all of sudden like magic ...12$ is taken from the register and giving to me ! I filed a complaint with state board and if it was up to me they would be closed ! So , if you choose to go here you have been warned ...buyer beware"

Just had a real craving for some nachos and apparently all they have are ""Greek Nachos."" Took a chance. What a mistake.

A huge bed of old shredded lettuce with a teaspoon of feta and tzatziki. This is hiding the mounds of olives, tomatoes and banana peppers. I know this sounds kind of appetizing, but it's all lukewarm too. And under alllllll of this, deep fried pita chips-what? 

I ate all the chips, my friend ate the tomatoes. With each bite I announced, ""this is the worst thing I've ever eaten."" My frugalness is what made me eat SOME of it.

wc5wAzfcO-7l37Tk6b5aAw,3,"Mixed Bag on both Food and Service

My wife and I have been here once before years ago but in the mood for diner food so we decided to give it another try. Last time as I remember was very good.

This time turned out to be a mixed bag, Some items were beyond the control and the restaurant, the other part well within their control.

It's a popular restaurant and they share a parking lot in a small strip mall with other stores so parking is woefully inadequate. Say people not only double parking but in some cases, triple parking. Ended up dropping my wife off to get in line while I parked next door in the Darby Acres  Shopping Center Parking lot and walking over.

When I walked in, my wife told me there was a 20 minute wait which was OK.  Seating for those waiting for a table or a take out order is limited so be prepared to wait.

The 20 minutes turned out to be pretty close to actual and frankly I was expecting longer. We were seated at a small table on the other side of the divider from the counter which was OK.  Small but still was able to put my crutches in a place where they were out of the way and did not impede other diners.

Server was there shortly with menus and to take our beverage orders. My wife ordered just water and I went with  1/2 and 1/2 Sweeten Tea which was still too sweet. Hate to thing what regular sweet tea taste like.

We had looked over the menu on line before we came so we pretty much knew what we were going to order.

My wife order the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which is one of her favorites. Came with Fries but for $.50 more you had the option of upgrading up to Onion Rings which she did.

I ordered the Roast Tom Turkey over Dressing which came with a Salad and a Side. Tried to order a Baked Potato but that was not one of the listed sides so went with Potato Salad along with the Salad which I got with an Italian Dressing.

The Salad came out shortly along with Bread which was pretty good. The Salad was good also but unfortunately I had to look at the aftermath through out the rest of my meal as demonstrated by the attached photos.

After I was finished and when my main course was served, I asked if she would remove the dirty dishes and all I got was "" in a minute"".  Asked again another time but in the end, I ended up looking at these dishes throughout our stay.

Entrees in or themselves were good and portion were huge. My wife loved her Philly Cheese Steak and Onion Rings and because the portions were so large, ended up taking some home.

My Tom Turkey was also good and ended up taking some home as well. Problem was the Mustard Salad which was suppose to be Potato Salad. Could not taste anything beyond the mustard and my lips were still burning 30 minutes after I left the restaurant. 

Mustard is suppose to be a subtle addition to Potato Salad and suppose to accent the dish. It's another thing to overwhelm the dish to the point that that is all you can taste and 30 minutes later, your lips are still burning.

Final problem as on check out and I did not catch this but my wife did. The $.50 upgrade to Onion Rings had become $.75. Not a big thing but became a big thing for my wife after watching dirty dishes for 20 minutes while we ate lunch.

Parking is beyond their control. Seating is within their control and they did a good job. The service including the implicit refusal to remove dirty dishes, inaccurate billing and inedible side dishes are well  within the control of the restaurant.

Some good points at the restaurant and a number of less than desirable so let's just put it this way, I've experience better and in may cases, a lot better."
ZnPfYCVbsvVdeD2K5qziAA,4,"It's quiet in here. I ordered the Royal Flush-lobster roll topped with deep fried lobster then baked with sweet yum yum sauce and eel sauce. It's gone!

-LKp7TzCGEiWRGu_sFpgig,2,"Decor/ Ambience:  Rundown, grimy, flying insects, sticky looking tables, waitresses wiping down tables with greyish looking dirty rags

Service:  Waitresses were sweet and friendly but food came out slow. The last sushi plate we ordered didn't even come with ginger or wasabi.

Food:  Ordered the all you can eat from the larger menu.  Initially we had decided on ordering from the 70 item menu but the sushi selection is SERIOUSLY lacking.  They offer only a few vegetarian type maki rolls and the typical kitchen stuff.

Okay, so the rice was extremely bland.  The meats/ combination was mediocre.  All in all, sushi was a little below average.  We never got everything we ordered either ... had to order the spider roll THREE times before we finally got it ... I think the chef selectively leaves off the more expensive rolls hoping that the diner will forget.  We overheard other guests complaining about the same thing.  

Ordered the agadashi tofu and it was not bad except there was a bleach taste - ugh :(  Ordered some other tofu appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting - it was cold and had these bark like paper things on it.  I have tried a similar type of tofu dish at other restaurants and it was much better.  My husband ordered the udon - he didn't say much about it, it didn't look that appetizing, and I had no desire to have a taste.

Left the restaurant feeling disappointed - oh well!  On to the next all you can eat sushi adventure :)"
jzaU0jm-m6xECl-GuXa6Eg,4,"Yes it may not be pretty or clean, but if you want a HK cafe experience there's really no other place (except for the other CC in Harvest hill and Pebble street).  Food is good, service is expected, experience is authentic. Bookmarked."
_HnbdpXkrrAMy7Zkv9diOg,4,"I enjoyed Cut while entertaining some clientele.  The stake selection is top notch with the aged Wagyu as the star of the show.  The taste is like ""steak squared"" cooked perfectly - I didn't really need the knife.  The sides are great and more than enough for one.  You'll want to add a sauce, mushrooms and some caramelized onion to top things off.  I had a table service old fashion that started the show and finished with the Banana Cream Pie!  Nice!  Only reason I left off the star is I ordered ribeye yet alas they brought New York.  I did not want to fuss and distract from my clients enjoyment of a fine dinning experience.  They all received and enjoyed what each had requested.  But must admit...I'm really disappointed.  I must say aside from that little faux pax, the service was decadent.  When the courses come out you and your guest are simultaneously swarmed on by what 1st appear to be the ""men in black"" whom turnout to be each guests personal server for that course.  I hope to get back soon and fill that hole in my culinary life with what I expect to be best ribeye ever!"

zx_rZBCj4ojuZpmwydnayg,3,"After a late night at the AGO, a bunch if us decided to go somewhere to grab a bite to eat.  As we wandered down Baldwin St we saw this place and decided to try it (mainly b/c it looked lime it could squeeze our group in). 

I will first off say that the service we had was great! From putting tables together to accommodate our group to being friendly and smiling throughout the night, I can't complain about the service.  So why only 2 Stars?

Well the food was allllllll-right.  Probably ate it b/c I was more hungry than anything else.  I ordered the smoked duck fettuccine.  The smoked duck actually was the best part - first off there were pretty decent amount of duck in here which had a nice smoked/salty taste.  It's the pasta that was a let down.  I think it needed another minute or so in boiling water b/c it was too al dente for me.  The nice cream sauce started to 'harden' as I was eating my meal instead of being rich and creamy it just kinda globbed into the pasta.  Essentially I just picked out the duck and ate that.  The portion is a bit small for the price (perfect for me but I think most people would find it slightly smaller sized than other places)

On Baldwin St I expect you to bring your game!  There are much better Italian places in the city."

When I checked out and checked my credit card statement it was $80 over what I was quoted. I called told the accounting office what was said the ladies response was ""nope there is nothing I can do for you but transfer you over to the front desk and you can speak to a manager"" .. no reimbursement for their fuck up when I clearly asked about any fees. Mind you i called Monday and spoke to a front desk lady and she said I'm sorry that happened call back between 8-4pm and speak with accounting and they will reimbursed you for that mishap.

Le menu est différent. J'ai pris la frittata bacon, oignons rouge et patates douces, avec un à-côté de latkes, ces fameuses galettes de pommes de terre, oignon et ail. Tout était très goûteux, sur l'assiette un filet de sauce crémeuse à l'aneth et une autre petite sauce très épicée. Les galettes étaient délicieuses. Le mimosa.... 5$!!! Le service, sympa et courtois!!!! et pour couronner le tout une petite gâterie sur le bras du resto, un morceau de pain foccacia à la cannelle. Grande amatrice de cannelle juste ici... ils sont tombés sur la bonne personne... c'était un pur DÉLICE. je donne rarement des 5*, c'est un de mes meilleurs brunch à vie, délicieux, du café américano jusqu'à la gâterie de départ en passant par la facture.

-z6Jaql58IfSfHbgiOz4sA,3,My friend and I stayed here for 4 nights and the hotel was nice and clean! We got a good rate through Priceline. The room was nice and clean. Bathroom was nice but did show a few wear and tear in the tub and walls. The bathtub drain would not work for baths. We ran out of tissues and toilet paper that we asked a cleaning lady if she had any and she didn't speak English nor understood English. Other then that it was a very place. Close to places we wanted to go to.
6VdLwI5YWxK4mii-NaaS0Q,4,"I've been coming here for a while now and I have to say it is a really awesome bar, by far the best on the danforth. An important thing to note is that even if you are brand new they will treat you like a regular ( or at least very nicely and with a personable touch)

I've had a lot of the food there and I can guarantee its all delicious. From the deep fried pickles (yes!) to the Italian dishes this place does EVERYTHING well. Pub fare as well as not-pub fare always satisfies. Their french fries are probably the best I've had in Toronto.

Drinks are nice, but not out of this world, good beer selection and pretty good cocktails.

although the buspersons are a little boring and uninterested, the waiters, owners, bartenders (all the same people) and chefs are all great fun to have about. A good crowd of assorted people come here (young/old/gay/straight/drunks/lightweights/dirty/clean) so you'll fit in no matter who you are. you'll want Martin to be the waiter, he is the really gay and really awesome one. You'll see what I mean, he will make you want to keep coming back.

A small grievance is that the place is fairly small, especially in the winter when their great heated patio is out of commission (I guess its not that heated), I consistently find myself walking in with a date and finding that there is only ONE table for two available in the whole bar, convenient but I like to play it safe.

I had brunch here once and it was great, although I'm more of a $5 breakfast guy.

I find it really funny that the elites are mad at this place because when they break a rule, the waiter gets annoyed with them (what else could happen?)"
yCfnno6VzjDH_0hHHFl3vg,4,"POKER, POKER... POKER!!!

I've stayed at the Hotel here before and it was 2.5 or 3 stars at best. The property is now owned by the same owners as the 4 Queens where I love to stay which is where I just stayed for 3 nights. Binions hotel portion has been closed for over a year for renovation, but the casino has remained opened. They have Zero Rake at their $2/4 Limit Hold'em poker tables 9am to noon. Not sure if that includes weekends. I wanted to play at Binions just cause it's sorta a tradition for me... playing where all the legends of poker used to play. I've had the pleasure to meet many of them... Doyle, Hellmuth, Ferguson, Chan and more... 

So on my last day of my Vegas trip, sat down at the $2/4 Limit cash game (the only game going at the time) and after a few minutes of play, I win a pot with quad fives... JACKPOT! Yup... I won over $1,500 for the high hand jackpot... Luv you more Binions!

No smoking allowed in the poker room. Free drinks while playing poker. A decent mix of regulars and tourists provide a lively game.

The hotel is being renovated so it should open sometime in 2013... In the meantime, if you like to find a low limit cash game or a $1/2 NL Texas Hold'em cash game... this is not a bad place to spend your time.

If you are looking to party, spend a lot of bucks on bottle service, VIP treatment and party with the beautiful people... look elsewhere... but if you are looking for an inexpensive casino to play some poker... I highly recommend you go to Binions at least once. 

I like to stay at the 4 Queens and play poker here at Binions and at the Golden Nugget if you want to know. They are all within a block of each other, as opposed to staying on the strip where it is a loooong walk just going to a casino next door to the one you are leaving..."

The hotel staff was friendly and check-in was efficient.  The staff made it a point to greet the guests any opportunity they could. Downside was the toilet flush was a bit slow. (be prepared to flush twice), the remote control did not work much (you can program your phone, though, to use as a remote control).  There were some water leaks coming from the lobby ceiling.

0. Price was great, maybe that's the reason for followings.
1. Room service delivery person demanded tip in what I felt like a ""... or else ..."" tone.
2. When requested for toothbrush. I recalled a representative replied to the effect of ""sir, we have toothbrush in our gift shop.""
3. We woke up to a few large insects flying around the room. Found a few more dead ones on the floor.
4. Missing items from our bathroom counter top, likely mistaken for trash by someone.
5. Customer service tried to address each item, but efforts were varied.

Lastly, we recently had a new addition to the family.

We seated ourselves close to the area where the food is put out. When they received my brothers order 3 of the staff members started making fun of it, saying ""obesity in a bowl"" and ""they're going to need to hit the gym after that"" and ""they couldn't wait to see who ordered this"". My brother heard them say this and was visibly upset. He was too embarrassed to go get his food so I got it for him.

Plus, they used to have a sexy photo of a 90's hunk in dungarees on the floor next to the woman's bathroom. It's fun to pose with after a few cheap Thai cocktails."

kVkM23fWRV6JKSrPz_MNsg,4,"Came here because I wanted Monta's kimchee fried rice to go haha. I also had a good craving of places like Coco ichibanya which I can't get anymore at home unless I drive a good while so Japanese Curry Zen really hit the spot in every way.

Although the service wasn't exactly the smartest cause we were trying to share some appetizers but waiter dropped it off w/ no plates and one utensil. -_- 

With that said, I thought the  curry was great. I got level 5 and I thought it was great. It was spicier than I thought it would be but I also tried a lvl 9 and it tasted the same for odd reason so I say just get the lvl 5...save the extra cents. The pork katsu was really good. I usually get scared when they put a lot of fat into my pork(where they basically rip you off cause it's so much fat) but that didn't happen. Croquette was okay too. Really, the spotlight was the curry + pork katsu cause it really tasted great.

The one thing I did mind was the amount of rice curry ratio. So little rice(the curry amount was fine) but I didn't want my rice to be all drenched up because of how little rice they give me. 

I do recommend it if you're a local."

The problem, the math they used was SO off!  Our bill was $55.20.  They said 18% was $13.50, it's actually $9.94!  ($3.56 more!).  For 20% they said $15, it's really $11.04! ($3.96 more!) And for 22% $16.50, not the true $12.14! ($4.36 more).  Unbelievable deceit!  I have pix of receipt if anyone wants to see it."

I came in at around 1:45 with my friend hoping that they wouldn't have started locking up as most places do when its starts to drag toward the end of the night. I waved in at the guy inside he said the were open (YAY)

The menu is a little overwhelming but there are tons of options to choose from. I don't even remember what I had because I told him to surprise me and then I covered my ears when my friend ordered the same thing. 

Ill post a picture of that monstrous delicious burrito. With C.A. written on in sour cream.

It was soooooo good.

Last time, my wife and I sat at the ""chefs bar"" and chatted with Darren most of the night, was a great experience and really cool to gain some insight to a very fast moving little kitchen with a focus on quality and consistency. Saw more than a few dishes not make the pass as Darren inspected every dish before handing over to ensure it was absolutely perfect. Food was ridiculous good, drinks also very good although I would maybe like to see one more rotating local tap. Prices are not cheap, but quality is top notch and I certainly left feeling that I got all of my moneys worth.  

For god sake folks please don't ask for soy sauce with the sushi, its all pre-dressed, this isn't Kinjo. 

Will definitely go back (can't wait)."

eunCLjy9KkOP3mUT-IZvkA,1,"*** Buyer beware *** First of all, appointments mean nothing to this establishment.  An oil change took 1 1/2 hours PAST my scheduled appointment time to be completed. That is unacceptable!  Additionally, what should have been a $16.95 oil change, turned in to a near $90 bill.  WITHOUT consent or approval, additional work was performed on the vehicle.  Who does that?!  I get it if you see something that needs attention during the oil change process, but you most certainly should notify the owner if additional charges are to be incurred.  Phil C. was of no help.  Needless to say, I contacted the powers-to-be at Big O in the hopes they can rectify this situation and prevent it from happening to others, although, I have a feeling this is common place here.  They are very unprofessional and if I were you, I would go elsewhere!"
VCR3Ews0k1bVxUW8wi38Og,2,"I came here yesterday evening at about 5:30 and were the first and only in the restaurant.  I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  

We were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entrée.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  

The curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.

As for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  

Not sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.

Eat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern)."

KTBadUq_Wv72JfmGRa5d7w,4,Went back the following Sunday and bought two more cups that weren't there before and aren't on the site either - the chocolate mint and chocolate sour cream (which doesn't taste very different from a regular chocolate cake except for perhaps slightly more moisture). The mint one had a chocolate chip coating while the sour cream one seemed to have cookie pieces/crumbles on it. Delicious!

YAF6MTHzxL_RM-tNB7FZZg,1,"Pros: server was great, food was good, nice atmosphere. 

Cons: very rude barista, bad coffee and food overpriced

This was my first time at Lucky's and I won't be returning. Upon arriving we decided to have a couple coffees while we waited for our table, this is the rude conversation I had with the female blonde elderly barista:

""What's a papa mocha?"" I asked
""It's the same as a mama mocha but with more fat"" she annoyed-ly answered 
""Ok, then what's mama mocha?"" I asked further
""Are you asking me what's a mocha?! It's cooofffeeee.....chooooccooolaaaate...."" She responded like I'm an idiot. 
""I know what a traditional mocha is"" I said
""I'm asking you if there's something that makes a Mama mocha different than a regular mocha"" I asked again. 
""It's a papa mocha with less fat"". She responded to my shock
""I'll have a medium coffee please. "" I surrendered. 
    She continued being rude, this time about me giving her my name instead of cash to pay for the coffee.  This was my first time. How was I supposed to know that she started a tab for me!? I was just trying to pay for my coffees.

Then we sat and ate. Host was nice. Coffee was terrible. Like that vacuum packed brick of coffee you buy from the corner store when you're really broke, bad. So on our out way out we complained to the rude barista about the coffee:

""I just wanted to tell you I really didn't care for the coffee."" I said
""Well that's the first complaint I've ever had about the coffee in 18 years"" she said
""Well, still, it's really quite awful, sorry. Do you know the brand of coffee you use or where the beans come from?"" I asked
She didn't answer me because she had no idea. Another barista said Caruso's in Brecksville. She made sure to tell me they roast it there.
   Anyone who knows anything about coffee knows that it doesn't matter Where it's roasted. And any barista worth half a cent, who cares even the slightest about coffee knows where the coffee is from. For the record Caruso's coffee is a business that buys the lowest grade coffee they can and they  roast it on site so that even though you're serving coffee that tastes like tar, you can shout from your rooftop, ""It's Locally roasted!"""
eHM6ekpD2Q6_ANi7l_r5Fg,5,I called the guys at Temprite when my hot water heater was leaking. They came out the same day and replaced it. The office staff was great and the installer was very professional. Definitely trustworthy people! Highly recommended.
SC-YeMW41-0ZaYdIv4tiBA,4,"A place that is probably out of our usual budget if without a Groupon, but a fantastic deal if you could snag one (2 entrees and 1 dessert for up to $69). It was our second time back and we loved it equally as much as the first time. We went on weeknights both times and there was live jazz music. Awesome band both times--great singers, but the volume was a bit loud to hold conversations over. My boyfriend and I were shoulders-to-shoulders both times and we could just manage to hear one another. So I would recommend calling to check before having a large group dinner.

We had the fried calamari (with shrimp) appetizer and we loved it! Portion was generous and we were both stuffed before entrees arrived. They always serve raspberry sorbet on this decadent flower bowl to cleanse your palate before your main dish arrives--yum! (Almost feels like cheating to have dessert before dinner!)

Main courses were fried chicken waffle and lobster tail. I didn't try the chicken waffle because my boyfriend cleaned his plate before I could. The lobster tail was so flavorful with the risotto! We had ice cream for dessert (up to 3 flavors) but it took a while for it to come out. 

Oh and the bread here is amazing!"

RMXk7AYNbHEVwPLZxUjAlA,2,"Acceptable bakery if you are willing to put up with the negative customer experience. The food isn't so good that it is worth it. The cashier taking your order was very angry and aggressive about people having their id. This wasn't an issue for us but her overall negative attitude just made it rather unpleasant to work with her. Then she got my order wrong (she charged me for something that was $10 instead of $1.50) which I didn't notice until after my mother had already swiped her credit card. There was this huge ordeal about having to get the manager. The whole time she was extremely rude even though she had been the one to make the mistake and was wasting our time. 


I thought I would give this place a try since there is a long line here, which I foolishly assumed meant the food was good. I think the long line is just because a lot of people get breakfast vouchers here. We got a fruit tart, which was priced at $5.50 and seemed reasonable for Vegas and the location. I also got some rolls that were super cheap at 3 for $1.50. The food was unremarkable but definitely acceptable. Two stars because the food is fine but I would never come here again."
ieX_AUwBJw3tgPwcg_jSPg,4,"Took our kids here while on vacation. They were not impressed with the trampoline area 
They said compared to others the springs were not right and you did not jump high at all.  However the laser tag was some of the best they have ever been in by the way we at talkin 16. 14 and 10 yr old boys .
It was not a bad place to have the kids blow off steam .."
_3XYVV2iM1uG9iM6pBHZ0Q,4,"Monday 2pm. This place is really perfect because it is a bit smaller than Florence and mesquite groves so it makes it much easier to watch the kids from anywhere pretty much. It was not crowded at all and the kids had free reign. The only thing I did not like about this pool was that my 6yo must have been right at the height line for the slides so he was and then was not allowed on the same slide due to shift change. So depending on which lifeguard was on at that time, it could go either way. They should have communicated amongst themselves better once they were able to verify that he had already been on the slide multiple times and was able to safely exit the pool unassisted. Other than that we had a great, relaxing time and we will continue to go back."

SJFQ4jtnNkhC8nHIMrlpqg,1,"Giving this washer/Dryer purchasing experience a 1 Star is being too generous. Two weeks ago I buy online, new larger set.  The dryer order gets sent to Eastern store as the Charleston store is out, but no one tells me this.   Come a delayed delivery day, they show up outside of the announced time, but we get it installed.  First use the next day the dryer has a internal short, defective.  OK, now comes the nightmare. I call many times, my rental house rep calls even more, after 10+ calls, to two stores, they claim they are out of the dryer, wait again.  My 20 month old W/D set sits in the garage. Now three days later they show up and take the defective dryer away, but wait, they fail to re-install my good older dryer to use and it sits 10' away. 

 Come 10 days later the replacement dryer is in, delivery set, NO ONE SHOWS UP!  Call store, SORRY, we forgot to load. Four hours of our time gone.  Next delivery is set for 4 days out!  But NO, they show up the next day without any announcement, and leave since no one is home. 

 Four days later, many more calls, they set delivery at 4-6 PM, and again, they show up at 2!  No one home, but agree to come back at 2:45.  So when they arrive, now nearly 2 weeks late, they realize the pick up crew that took the defective dryer also took my NEW gas line and vent hose!!  Delivery men  refuse to place in the hose, and leave it sitting in the garage!  They did offer to take it back to the store, if you can believe that!  Two weeks later, NO DRYER, tired of calling , and they stole my new hose and vent pipe.  CC Refund time...  RUN, NEVER USE THIS STORE FOR APPLIANCES."

Very small room, very limited drink selection, very cold (obviously), VERY OVERPRICED. Music and drinks were okay and the whole thing was neat at first but after about 5 minutes you start wondering why you paid so much to go in there. The worst part was that they don't allow any cameras or cell phones, and instead have a photographer taking pictures which they try to sell to you for $20 a piece. Cool to experience but not worth the money at all."

edNxkkj1bb-wKwwPixUrFQ,1,"No more Bowl of Pho.
With a heavy heart I must write that I will no longer be a Patron of Bowl of Pho. As a regular customer since it's opening, I have found it to be a suitable, close to home replacement for Superior Pho Downtown.  Recently, the restaurant has been sold and is now not even a cheap Facsimile of the Former.   Over my last four visits out of dozens, yes I gave it four last chances, the protein portions in their Pho has become quite miniscule.  On my second last visit I asked the girl working the front counter if the place had been sold.  She replied yes, and said she was the new owner and why I asked.  I told that it seemed like her portions have gotten quite small and she said there had been no changes.  I asked her if I can have more meat and she begrudgingly did so.  Today I visited, giving my close to home friend one more chance.  Low and behold, I got my bowl of Pho, and the same portions.  I actually took out the meat and took a picture. Four or five pieces of sliced meatball, four pieces of meat, and a tiny portion of tripe.  During my latest visit to Superior Pho downtown, I took a picture of their Pho, you be the judge.  I know another issue with my fellow Yelpers is the ridiculously small amount of Siracha they provide. It keeps getting smaller and smaller. Today the owner was out and the manager on duty couldn't even open the cash register to give me change.  This man has been working there since day one, and can't even be trusted with the register. Shame.
Not to sound like Anthony Bourdain,  I must say Farewell Bowl of Pho, Farewell."

Of course the rest of the store is also amazing and will force you to fill up your little purple cart whether you like it or not.

I ordered a vegetarian sandwich. I'll admit it was a little weird to eat a sandwich that had the filling a burrito normally would have, but I still liked it. I did not get a drink when I went, but I would be interested in trying one another time.

Very friendly staff that took great care of us.
We were greeted, seated and had drinks in less than 3 minutes on a busy Saturday morning. 
You can choose between counter service, table or a booth for seating. 
Fresh brewed coffee and iced tea. They had different flavors of creamer for the coffee, we had the French vanilla. 
I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast...YUM! I wish I had room for another order. I had agreed to share before the food came and I wish I hadn't because it was so good. It doesn't really need the syrup, but it tastes good on top. Bacon was cooked perfectly. 
My guy got the big bear (10oz) chicken fried steak, red potatoes and biscuits for his over easy eggs. Chicken fried steak was great. We doctored the gravy a bit to add more flavor. Eggs were cooked correctly and the red potatoes with veggies were great. 
Our server Angela was very attentive and took great care of us, we never had a need for anything. 
We WILL be back!"
nuzlKO5o7o1vQuq6cFki3A,5,I go there about once a week for B12 shots and the ladies there are super awesome!  They are always friendly and accommodating and the office has a wide range of appointment times available.  No complaints!
kP3V-5TWf18sGAEhcA2FaA,1,"Literally just came back from this place with my bowls. Worst experience at a Chipotle ever. There was no line and I ordered 4 bowls for my friends and I. The first lady made it seem like it was inconvenient for her to deal with my order. She was impatient and completely threw out customer service. Their portions are incredibly small as well, you can tell they are greedy with how much they give to their customers. The second lady also gave attitude which was completely unnecessary. It was very frustrating for my friend and I to experience that, and would not recommend this specific location if you want Chipotle.
Just to add on, all of our orders were incorrect and completely disregarded what we actually wanted on our bowls because they were too busy being rude instead of hearing what we wanted."
RbwPFJBuz3EFHpqNyXSXkg,5,"I stayed here during the last 2 recent Vegas trip. Love it here! The rooms are suite style so it's pretty big with a couch, dining table, kitchen, fridge, and a big bathroom. Great for large groups.

The hotel is off the strip, but only by a 5 minutes drive. It's well worth it for the price.

In the casino they have a restaurant that has steak and eggs for $5 starting at midnight until 5am, I believe. It's decent and you cannot beat the price.

During the most recent trip we took, we checked in at 4am after the club and checked out at 9am. When we went to check out the lady decided to only charge us the resort fee since she said we only stayed there for 5 hours and we technically only took a ""nap"" there. Cannot beat the customer service either!!"
giawT01_WecCBVEcHaq6kw,4,This is a quaint little restaurant with old diner feel. I had a club sandwich that was amazing and huge. Fair like fries. My server Sonya was very friendly and knowledgeable for only her second day!!! Even other guests were talking to other tables definitely a must try.
AlNU-4eVR2jsNSWEnSUmlQ,4,A great FREE attraction which is also located in a reasonable distance from a metro so thats another plus. The nice park (or parc) is at the edge of a lovely canal walk and what I like about it is that during the summer you see people there enjoying the sun and during winter you can come there and see huge chunks of ice floating on the river..breathtaking.
uxvmBes8wMogJxPpZYqF1g,5,"Hello again to all the Yelpers' out there that actually have been looking or reveiwing my comments and factual experiences..well I just wanna start out by saying for my most recent experience within 24 hours was a ""Great"" one. This establishment is ran by some very cool and humble individuals. Angela whom was our cashier had nothing but inviting energy when she assisted us with our choices of pita's or different cuisines to choose from. Her recommendations were the ""Bomb"" I loved my Chicken Pita Wrap..thanks Angela. This was my first time ever, so I didn't know how to proceed in the line. There was this also very humble and inviting Gent by the name Mark that was also very attentive. I found out his name from the cashier Angela, when I asked her his title. She told me ""He was her Manager"". I looked for him personally first but unfortunately he was not around, did want to verbally tell him of our experience in person. The cooks are in a league all by themselves. Everything was superb. I did really enjoy the atmosphere, it was a gorgeous but breezy day yesterday. I will make this a favorite spot to go back too."
srEMjr1iawfLnFk3I0z7jA,4,Staff was wonderful and would help me make the decision to return.  The facility is dated but well maintained.   The pools are nice but the mini golf course needs repairs and better signing.
GyBGuo49yFpcnvKMErRbPg,4,"Great place for seafood, the mild original sauce is a bit spicy, we had the shrimp, it comes in a plastic bag with the heads on. we ordered a corn and it's in the sauce which makes it awesome.They will give you a sample of the crayfish if you ask,  I'm not positive but I think you get more than a pound when you place your order, [it's sold by the pound.] We also tried the butter garlic sauce, good taste.
Our waitress talked us out of the medium spice, if it's your first time order mild.  It was pretty spicy... the ca-gin fries are a bit spicy too.  
The second time we went wasn't as spicy but still good 
They'll give you a bib and gloves if you want.  They also have a small dish you can ask for on the side that has salt and pepper, which you squeeze lemon juice that makes another winner dipping sauce."
nk2Ysl0scN-hi2T4YlhCvQ,4,"This is exactly what you might expect from Michael Symon- unique, tasty dishes, perfectly presented, in a lovely warm atmosphere.  Perfect for a date night, special occasion, business dinner, etc... The only downside, was the hubs wasn't as huge of a fan- the more old-school foodies, that prefer more beef options, won't have as much to chose from. Even if there is only one thing on this menu that you can find to like (picky eaters out there)---you'll enjoy it."
xgcFr8EBCyYzJozNsoRZng,5,"I had a wonderful experience purchasing a used car from Arrowhead Cadillac. I worked with Daniel who was extremely helpful. Other employees were kind and friendly and did an exceptional job of making me feel welcome in the dealership. Although the process took a while, the purchase and trade-in was handled very smoothly and they were flexible with pricing. Daniel even spent extra time to learn my new car's navigation system so he could teach me the ins and outs. Thank you Arrowhead Cadillac!"
rn07T3Sz65zOyD8d1cmbfA,5,"What a great coffee shop serving delicious coffee for me and hot chocolate for the kids.  I enjoyed the rosemary brown sugar latte (delicious!) and an iced latte with a hint of vanilla. The space is modern, clean, and stylish and the service is top notch.  Can't wait to return."
gKXbFwqDTBYjcmcTqbg_bQ,4,"This review is for the BRUNCH service on weekends. :) 

Cute little spot on Charles Street between Bay and Yonge; walk too fast, and you might just miss it! However, when you find your way inside, it's hard not to be charmed by the cozy atmosphere and tasty -- if a bit boring -- menu. I came here for brunch at 10:30 on a Sunday expecting it to be packed to the gills, but luckily there were a few tables free. 

Although the service was a little slow, our server was sweet and friendly. I had the French Toast -- it's a large plate with 3 humongo slices, plus bacon. The French Toast was nicely eggy and custardy, but nothing earth shattering. The bacon could have been a little more crisp, but it was still delicious.

I'm so glad there's a place near my apartment that's open 24 hours and not your typical greasy spoon diner. It may be basic, but I like its unfussiness and simplicity. I'll definitely be here more often."

vJOGTWl34f7fxHbtnmI9uw,5,"Our family group of 7 completed the Runestone room today! We were looking for a fun activity while family was in town & Eludsions was the perfect solution! Luckily, my boyfriend, Andrew, is a game master here! I love hearing how much fun he has at work and what a positive environment it is. Even though he was our game master, he didn't give us any clues beforehand! It was a really great experience, we all worked together to solve puzzles, peruse the room and eventually escaped... 

I would recommend this as a date night, family activity or even team building! The props are top notch and the rooms are really thought through! You won't be disappointed"
fpI4lKvQySuPrfOlwhv5nw,5,Lives up to the hype! I recommend one of the Bento Boxes so you get a nice sampling of sushi and burgers!
QKeetdovtUNhCZeTR4Isww,2,"Oh my goodness - spoiled spoiled spoiled. This was my first trip to Madison for work (Go Badgers) and I was told by my boss I could not pass up Mickies Dairy Bar. Lucky for me, I have the sleep cycle of a retired grandmother so I was up and ready to eat by 6:00am. I strolled across campus from my hotel and found a quaint restaurant where I wasn't the only person outside taking pictures of the facade of the building. Inside, I had a flashback to the 50s that I never lived in with the old menu price and decor. I sat at the bar and took far too long to order because I wanted to examine my options (aka check out other peoples food). I settled on one griddle cake and a side of bacon as I had a long day of walking ahead. The griddle cake was the size of a toddler bicycle wheel and came along with an apology for taking so long -- which it didn't take long at all. Soon after I arrived, ESPN followed me in to shoot a special on the ""tastes of the town"". I slowed the pace of my eating to be an innocent-background-fat-kid-eating-pancakes bystander (why didn't I order an omelet...) and made friends with the locals just chit chatting. Just the one griddle cake was too much to handle but I wish I could have eaten the strawberry rhubarb cobbler fresh out of the oven steaming with melted butter right in front of my nose. The manager was so nice to explain all of the foreign Wisconsin words and foods and told me about how nuts it got during the day. I could have sat and made friends all day but I decided to scoot and pay my bill (cash only) and wander on my way. A MUST eat if you are in Madison, just arrive early! Thanks for the hospitality."
8ORMT_bIqDfU5HcihpkJmQ,4,"This is a well run gym at a great price point.  They have a walking track, large free weight area, and 3 sets of circuit weights.  The classes are better than average and included in your fee.  This is a great gym for those not looking to spend a lot of time looking at themselves in the mirror."
AMGM1HkG8gGeOdWu4kz6PA,4,"Great prices, crazy deals, clean store, useful staff!
No issues with quality even though they carry off name brands.  Only returned a gadget once that didn't work good but dozens of other items so far so good."
MsPD3V3ouphahmn1cc9Ugw,2,Really? You should have more respect. Told you no pickles (husband is allergic) and you put them on the burger under the cheese! Glad I took a bite before he ate it. Not cool at all!!!!!
Ws3jjS902ag0i1N6nFEYLQ,1,"I order delivery quite a bit, and while I think their sushi is decent, the service is so abysmal that I will no longer be ordering from here. 

Today, I decided to try something out of the ordinary and got a salmon skin roll. It was my first time ordering this, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect but it was entirely inedible. I took one bite and threw out the rest. There were so many fish scales in the one piece of sushi, that it tasted completely disgusting. When I called to complain I was given a very insincere ""Oh, well thanks for letting us know. Bye."" No mention of, I'm sorry, would you like a refund, nothing. I've been a loyal customer for over a year now, and this is how they treat their customers.  

As is, I avoid going to eat at the restaurant because my one experience there is not a pleasant one. The ""waitress"" did not greet us when we came in, took 15 minutes to bring us a menu, and we had to chase her down for water because she was back in the kitchen for a lengthy amount of time when there were other tables beside ours looking bewildered. Our grilled calamari showed up cold, and tasted like rubber, and half of what we ordered never showed up, so when we questioned as to where it was she told us that they ""were out"". Forget coming to tell us, we had to ask after an hour of waiting for it.
 
Whoever owns this establishment should really reevaluate how they treat customers.
They've definitely lost my business and I'll be letting all my friends know not to come here."
0-I_QBu-LAlpKzxpByI2ig,3,"New is always better! Finally a good bbt place in this neck of the woods 

Cleanliness: 5 * probably cuz it's still very new

Friendliness: 5* again probably cuz it's still new, staff was quick and friendly and not jaded yet

Seating area: sufficient tables and chairs for small to large groups but second row was too tight near the cash line that it would be very unpleasant to be having people bump into your jacket or back of your head. 

Music: today Sunday late afternoon- gansta beats, felt like I was in a club, very different vibe than other locations.

Tapioca: 4* it wasn't as fresh and chewy to their standards, but at least they had it as another location I go to never seems to make enough

Parking: lots, in a big plaza not hard to get a spot close by, it faces hwy48 and plaza sign not up yet"

There are plentiful TV screens behind the bar area to watch the games on and lots of seating which made it much more appealing than the always over-packed and crowded Buffalo Wild Wings down the road."

XA1BkbjRONOerZk650q_RQ,3,"Caution: Do not go inside if you're weak and a shopaholic...because it's basically bagporn in there.

So I've been searching for the Sevruga Wallet on a Chain in black for like forever. I've reached out to my SA at Saks in NYC like a bazillion times with no luck. Basically I gave up on my search...until fate brought me to this Chanel.

Valerie G. and I have been on a shopping ban since late October because we realized we've spent approx the amount of a down payment on a house this year and it really isn't okay. While walking down the strip I was just telling my friend Regina how good I've been since my ban and how I was so proud of myself....then we see the Chanel store and went inside just to window shop....and saw the WOC I wanted!!

I literally HAD to buy it. It has been sold out in all the Chanel stores in NYC since it came out and I was so excited to see it staring right at me! They only had the silver version in the store, but the SA helped me find one in black and ship it to me so I wouldn't have to pay tax! Can't WAIT for that package to be delivered!

Good service, good selection (especially if you're from NYC)...but bad for my shopping ban and wallet (two Chanel bags in one year..eeps)."
H0UWIyr7oaeQTxvEezGW-w,5,"Great English style pub right off of St. Laurent. There's a ton of Montreal beer on tap and the bartenders are great. Around $7 for a beer or mixed drink, but worth it and expected in the city. The had a two-person cover band tonight (Reuben and someone else) who were fantastic. Only thing I can't comment on is the food. 

Definitely check this place out."
eiAPiNwNZFDfC0v-QgO8sw,1,"Had a reservation, waited an hour and a half. Asked for compensation for the wait because no one offered anything while we were waiting. The owner offered to pay for all our drinks and then when the bill came, charged us for the drinks we ordered. The table sitting next to us called out the owner and expressed that they too, heard that the owner had said he could pay for our drinks given our long wait. 

I have never been spoken to the way in which this owner had spoke to me, especially with a reservation.

While the food was good, I would never want anyone to support such a disrespectful man."

We paid $7 for entrance. We drove the scenic route and made stops to hike and take pictures. It was so beautiful and peaceful! The scenic loop map tells you which stops have bathrooms, which is awesome. I love that the visitor center has a filtered water station! 

Highly recommend coming here!"
b76otEWhemlwM8Bx-qZD4g,1,"Word to the wise - before you blindly accept the repair shop that your home warranty company sends you to - check them out on Yelp!

These guys sent a technician out, he was nice enough and pretty quickly diagnosed my fridge issue, and was going to order the part.  Got a call from the infamous Debbie the next day saying that this part was under mfgr warranty and not covered under the home warranty.  We called GE to have a guy come out the next day, bummed on having to pay another $100 on top of the trade fee I'd already paid to ProTech.

I looked at my mfgr warranty, and it clearly stated what was covered, and the part that Debbie said was covered - was not.  So began my 2 hours of phone calls...

Finally, after 2 calls to GE and 3 calls to the home warranty company, I got the home warranty company and GE on the line together with me, and GE clearly stated that the part in question was not covered by their warranty.

Thinking I was done, I called Debbie back, left a message (I got the answering machine 3 times I called that day - they have caller ID apparently) - and she called me back and told me that SHE had talked to GE and they said that the part was covered.  Keep in mind that I had my warranty paperwork, and had also talked to two different people at GE warranty, and they were very clear to me and the (very nice) home warranty company rep that it was not.

I offered to call them together and ask so we could get it straightened out for once and for all, but she refused.  Very impolite and combative.  If I would have told her the earth was round, she would have told me it's flat.

Looking through all of the other folks that have had bad experiences with this company, I'm a little shocked that this leading home warranty company continues to send their customers to ProTech.

So we cancelled the GE service call (saving us $100 we didn't need to spend) and were re-assigned to another company.  And yep, checked them out on Yelp!!"
uBBm0cXgmxsFVrfmUFm8ng,5,"I stayed, gambled, and partied at Encore during the Halloween weekend. I must say, this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Granted, I've never stayed at a 5-star hotel before, but I feel you cannot ask for more. 

Gambling: The roulette table was so much fun. My friend Jose spilled his drink on the table and nobody even yelled at him or made him feel bad. They just cleaned it up and joked about it. So cool. Also, as a first time customer, they gave me and my friend Carlo $20 to play the slot machines. We ended up winning over $100 collectively from that.

Pool: European. Nuff said.

Room: OMG. So nice. My phone had my name on the LCD. The room had a doorbell. Next to my bed was a control panel that could close or open the curtains! Swivel flat screen TV. Floor to ceiling windows. Tub and shower. Dual sinks. Amazing concierge service.

Nightclub: XS and Surrender are both at Encore. Surrender was awesome, but XS, I cannot explain how nice this nightclub is. You have to go to find out. It was expensive ($50 cover and $500 bottles), but hey, it's Vegas. It's expected.

Food: Ate at the Wynn buffet. Incredible. Although I prefer hot crab legs over cold ones. It was fresh nonetheless."
Oz9IKLVE7l6P9Me8xXOXiQ,5,I purchased a mattress this past week and Josh made it a flawless process. No pressure what so ever and a plethora of knowledge. I didn't immediately buy from R and S and I painstakingly shopped 5 other top ranked and recognized mattress stores to no avail. I am extremely happy. The mattress was received the day after while I wasn't home. My wife was home to receive it and had no issues at all with the delivery. I am so happy that a process typically so irritating was made into such a pleasure. Thank you!!!

The service was bad, the atmosphere was nothing to write home about. I would never Recommend this restaurant to anyone not even an enemy no one should be treated that way. The so-called manager came to the table and offered us free desert for the wait, we just want our food, and when it came wrong & cold we decided it's time to leave & never look back."

G_Fes2oR8jKu9_B-rPA00w,4,"Going to Camelview is definitely a positive way to spend an evening.  Its retro (because it's old) neon lights and blue building exterior make me want to put on a casual dress, grab a clutch, and have a date at the movies.  I would like it if they sometimes had later showings, but other than that it's a great place to go see a film that maybe isn't out (yet or ever) in other theaters around the valley.

On the walls are painted murals of award winning or iconic movies (like a big shot of the classic scene from The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman).

The actual theaters aren't stadium style, but it's never been a problem for me or anyone else I've gone with to see the screen, even when it's crowded."

Frozen hot chocolate = milk + ice + hot cocoa powder blended together for $10.  Not sure why everyone is raving about it?!  It was the worst drink ever!  Especially in comparison to a regular milk shake...

On top of that, the ice cream used in the shakes, cones, and sundaes is Ben and Jerry's.  Uh, you are a fancy schmancy ice cream shop and you don't make your own ice cream?  

To top it all off, there was a 30 minute wait to get in.  There is a real B&J's just down the street on the strip and another one in the Miracle Mile shops...So why waste your time at Serendipity 3?

Then told they never scheduled me even though I spoke with someone and was given a day and window and I stayed home again to wait. 6 days with no water and now told the part was not ordered and will take 3-5 days to get - HORRIBLE!

OgtdKjdk6VpVrn8o-PBMQw,3,"Yelpers are in love with this place, great reviews!!!!   But, I an not sure how this spot has consistent 4 and 5 star ratings.   I found it totally mediocre.   Is it better than Olive Garden, absolutely.  Is it better than Carrabba's - not so sure.  I used those chain restaurants as a point of reference.    At prime time, expect a wait.   The place is small.  No bar, so you will have to sit in the reception area, which is also tiny, but there is only one bench, so just stand there.   Speaking of small area, this lends itself to a very loud dinner.  Just saying, if you are expecting an intimate ""date night"" dinner, forget it.

My dinner was the Chicken Marsala.  Not the greatest, not the worst.  Meh, just okay.   Very large portion is a bonus.   My wife went with Chicken Parm.  She liked it, but commented the sauce was average.  My son went with the Shrimp Alfredo, he loved it, but had to add salt and extra grated parm cheese.   What I am getting at, although this is a family owed chain, the sauces are just average.   Nothing earth shattering.  Also, the meals do not come with a salad, that is an upcharge.   The service was okay, they were slammed, she was keeping up."

I put in a request through Yelp for a quote & was upfront from the beginning that I have cats. I was told to go to the website to secure the estimate and was even given a code for $20 off which was really appreciated.  I got the quote, booked the appointment for first thing Monday morning (yay!) and then had a question about how they'd charge my card... I guess I entered my card info wrong so it was showing declined, which was no big deal. Then today, 24 hours before I'm expecting them to come, I get a message that the only teams he has available for the next several weeks are highly allergic to cats. I mean, I get that people can be allergic to cats but 1) when I initially contacted this company he should have said that and 2) if you're going to a run a business where your teams of employees have to go into homes, it is very likely that some of those homes will have cats so you should either A) Make it clear on the website or B) hire people who aren't allergic.

It reminds me of a cross between Chipotle and Bajio, The overall presentation seems a little more authentic, if that makes sense.  The small burrito lunch special is a good deal, but I have grown to love the (slightly more expensive) Tropical tacos.  The mango salsa is addicting, and the excess that falls off can always be scooped up with the included chips.  

On that note, of variety of meals we got (burritos, tacos, quesadillas) they all seems to fall apart at some point.  Not a huge deal, your burrito just becomes sort of a rice bowl halfway through.  Make sure you grab a few extra napkins!"

CHASHU: Okay so I rarely ever have Chashu cut so thinly, but wow that shit just straight up melted in my mouth. ACTUALLY, usually it just melted away as I was trying to pick it up with my chopsticks, but if it ever made it to my mouth still intact, it melted away, like BUTTA. 4.5/5

PRESENTATION: Beautiful. 5/5

SERVICE
The servers were pretty, attentive, polite, and knowledgeable. I'm not sure if they were Japanese though, but they both did have accents. I don't care about that anyway. They're everything you look for in servers.

ATMOSPHERE
Looks just like a Shinsengumi in terms of the layout and that's a good thing. Well, the Shinsengumi by my house, at least.

I approve of this ramen joint, but if I'm going to Las Vegas again, I might skip it so that I can try all the other wonderful Japanese restaurants around. Nothing personal though! I'd recommend it!"
bDyLAQhLTg9Yvlq138aBww,2,"I played Ocotillo a couple of years ago and it was very nice--well maintained, interesting track and nice people. I played it today and was astounded at how far the course had deteriorated. I expected some issues with Course conditions because of overseeding. But they had also ripped up all the irrigation system and there were bare spots all over the fairways. The tee boxes were beat up and the greens were bumpy and inconsistent speeds. 

All that and I still had to pay $55. I probably won't go back--too many other nice courses in the area."
6B68V6LuqueefNkFliLQdw,3,"We stopped here for a quick meal before heading to the airport. The food was decent, but not great. It's worth considering that it's an order-at-the-counter joint, but even then it was a bit of a letdown. I'd go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
NIV3RKw428wCgvIhDMKnhQ,4,"Good, consistent food and really good service.  Whether dining in or carrying out we've never been disappointed."
oq0sjGAM-hoXLZvvZEAR8w,5,"This is the BEST dental practice ever! Dr. Owtad is an amazing Dentist who alleviated my fears of having dental work done. Very knowledgeable, gentle, explained everything to me, and did not charge me for unnecessary dental work like other dentists before him had done to me. I was treated kindly by the very friendly and understanding office staff, hygenist, everyone, and not once did I ever feel intimidated, judged, or misled. I feel as though I received very professional care with professional results at honest prices. I had bridge work put in, and the gal who makes temps is very talented as well at shaping and matching colors. Recently sent my husband to Dr. Owtad for some crowns and he has received compliments on the temporary teeth he received for now. Thank you Dr. Owtad and staff for giving me my smile and confidence back, I am happy to return to you for my cleanings in 6 months! I truly value your service. You've got a great team; it has been a huge blessing in my life!!!"
8rGn2RexYN0_GJ5N10rVKw,4,"I'm short and now that I'm all grown up, I'm finding the importance of finding a good place for alterations. I just brought a few pairs of jeans for hemming. Simple enough. They do the job well and in a timely manner (3 days; for an extra charge, they can do same day alterations). No muss, no fuss. The women I've interacted have been really friendly and the prices are very good. $10 to hem jeans. Though they take credit cards, you can save 5% if you pay cash. 

This past week, I brought in a few dresses to be hemmed and taken in. Again, the work was great and they have  given these old dresses some new life. For those of you who are trying to live more ""green,"" reviving old clothing (as opposed to buying new clothes) is the way to go.

Another good thing is that their prices are laid out on their board when you enter.  Therefore, you know exactly what you're getting in to. This isn't the place where you can haggle for a discount. I definitely respect this. The people who run this shop stand by their work and their prices are fair. I'm definitely coming back!"
VQyTCAwVFw_NYbcRZiQqug,4,"If you're in the area you def must stop by. Don't skip the macaroon or marshmallow, you'll regret it!"
0yWPZHiyfmIF4XLMKL21ww,5,I've been to this place for at least 10 times by now. I've had mostly everything they would offer. The high tea is different than what they have when they first opened. It's so must improved. I enjoy it very must. And their mango slush and LaPostté Milk Green Tea is bomb.
R1khSsGRRtbzSXJnYDX1tQ,5,"Real deal teppanyaki. The best you will ever have. The meat cuts are perfect and no fewer than eight sauces (which are prepared right in front of you). It's a two hour experience. 

Expect r-rated comedy and ball-busting."
SYN-d7Iy95BIQInIM393qQ,1,"Total shit show as per usual.... When did showcasing new product covered in wrinkles become the norm?!?!  One or two employees running the cash wrap with a line of 4-7 people waiting.... (2-3 unused registers) Also,  the ""kid"" checking me out stood there putting sensors back on the previous customers returns (7 items!) before he would help me.... I said ""are you seriously going to make me wait while you do that?"" He said ""I just have to get these off the counter"" I said, ""well don't you think that's a terrible policy, to make us all wait while you do that?"" In this economy I'd think efficient and friendly customer service would be the number one priority.  Just sayin... This is why I avoid H & M!"
RkzkDea_ll9H-CCHyB_q9A,4,"Finally a nice Thai food place in beautiful Boulder City, NV. Lettuce wraps were crisp and full of flavor. Ginger Chicken, Beef with Broccoli, and their super hot Curry Chicken were spot on. The Dining experience was a pleasure. The service was expeditious. I did not particularly like the peanut sauce as their house salad dressing but that was just me, otherwise this a pleasant surprise in a small town not known for this kind of food."
X4tWxnk0brAeJRDMwuuKvw,5,"I just moved to area and wanted to find a place that cooked like my aunt did back home.. My husband and I stumbled across this establishment, the only thing we had were there Chitterlings and it is beyond amazing :) looking forward to tasting other things on the menu. As far as the restaurant goes it's completely hot so we wanted to get our food and to get out of there quickly.."
5KigXgOA9xKlzEmkUG3AZg,5,"I was referred here by my friend since I was having a horrible experience at the one I was going too. I have to say I am very pleased with Celebrity and the girls who work there. I am a single mom and work 2 jobs so it is very nice that they allow my kids to wait in the lobby while I tan. The first time I brought my daughter there I came out from tanning and found the young lady playing barbies with my daughter. It amazed me that she took time and did that. It was very sweet of her. I have only been there 4 times now, but each time I have gone I have had great experiences. The girls all have been very friendly and have gone out of there way to ask questions or make small talk. That goes a long way."
iPlK3byzWpLNxgyYkRn0HQ,5,I've been going here for gel acrylics and pedis for 6 years and always get  great service and beautiful work.  They have a full selection of gels and great pricing.  I would recommend them highly.
fioREu2KJFaY3zMB7kD30A,2,"We used to love coming to this place but it has been going downhill quickly. The food used to be above average for a sports grill but now it has gotten so bad that we ate before our last visit and just went for the craft beer and live music. The service is now incredibly slow and no longer friendly. Several regulars recently said that they won't be returning anymore either. Too bad, it used to be a fun place."
pYnj60S5dedtInCqFqJSww,5,I love Una! They have great pizza and good service considering how busy they get.  I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant!!
_RIuiKTordZZUFOTJSHp4Q,5,Had the herbal body scrub and it was HEAVEN. Laura is amazing! Super professional. On time. Relaxing. Great pressure. First half is a full body scrub down and second half is a massage. Done by an RMT so you can use benefits :) Will definitely be back.
jbCBZherfDr266GC6vojMg,4,"I have finally found a place close to home who can do my nails RIGHT! I've had some bad experiences, which you can see in my reviews, but Nail Tech redeemed my faith in nail technicians close to the Anthem and Silverado area.

I love seeing Angie and Suzie - they both do an amazing job and have great attention to detail with each set of nails or pedicure I've had done. I do like the whole staff, though! Everyone works hard to be sure their clients are happy and that we are all having a nice time while relaxing to get pretty for the world! 

My recent go-to is an acrylic overlay with gel and the price is reasonable for the work I have done. 

I do suggest that you make an appointment versus walk-in, but it's as easy as a phone call! They are on time with their appointments, unlike some other shops I've tried who are 30+ min late on appointments made."
3EufuDTJyqhyvZAKMyTutA,5,I am completely obsessed with this restaurant I am completely obsessed with this part of Cleveland Ohio I had some major major major things happening to me and this little nook in my city that were life-changing and I hated those things happen to me there because it ruined how much I love that part of the city this restaurant is on real Yumma...try everything on the menu and when you're done trying everything on the menu happen all over that part of the city it's so young beautiful and alive.
RoVD34YDu7pJjXrFQNhQ8w,5,"I love my man, believe me, but everytime I eat here, I want to kiss the man who makes my pie. It is the most perfect pizza you can make...everytime. If you are looking for Dominos or Pizza Hut-style pizza, this is not for you. If you are looking for crispy flatbread, topped with gourmet ingredients (many flown in from their native lands) and cooked right, this is your new favorite! It is never crowded for a late afternoon bite, but be careful on a weekend evening. It is not bursting at the seams, but there may be a little bit of a wait. If all of the five star reviews so far don't lead you to believe it's the best, go try it and prove them wrong!"
Ik5cTOArJy9HQG4D71602w,4,"honestly i made a mistake when i ordered.  I wanted to try as much as i could thinking i would sample half and put the rest away for lunch the next day.  That was a mistake and i ate myself into a painful food coma.

First up was the chicken.  overall it was very tasty.  i liked that it had it's own unique taste.  i wanted to eat fried chicken that did not taste like KFC or Popeyes.  It's worth getting out of the car just for that.

Ribs - The ribs were also good.  Very meaty, very delicious.

my sides - i didn't eat much of because i was focused on the ribs and chicken

very happy i found it"
UO2adbTh_zHGscT8gZbQeA,4,"Food was great. Thier pizza with smoked salmon and shrimp was delicious. ( sounds gross but i gave it a try ). Serving was huge. Although the brunch buffet is expensive $22 if im not mistaken, for what they served. Tons of dessert options but they're always running out of food.  Will give it a try again."
db60970-vMjPpRXtguFwDw,4,"Once I found the place (tucked into a corner in a condo center, weird) I enjoyed the place.  Really caters to those trying to avoid certain foods for whatever reason, vegan, gluten free, ect, and does it incredibly well.  The menu clearly lays out which each selection has in it, whether that be eggs, gluten or whatever.  Since it was our first time we started with the air baked sweet potato fries which had cinnamon and nutmeg and was served with a sweet/spicy dipping sauce, then came the green chili chicken soup which was a little thin as far as consistency, but the flavors were good .  For the entree I had the mango, black bean salad with chicken.  It had sweet juicy mango with white meat chicken, black beans, raspberries and served with a tasty lime dressing.  It was so delicious!  To top it off I ended with a vegan/gluten free brownie, I have no idea they got the flavor and texture so right without all the ingredients I would normally associate with a brownie.  Truly a mystery.  Can't wait to return.  Like some previous yelpers, I did have a slight problem with the seemingly dis-interested wait staff.  Had to ask for refills repeatedly."
KE4PT_4SzhmJ_PN-PUcbHQ,4,"It's rare that I feel that a place is five stars right from the jump. The first time we tried to have dinner at Superica, on a Saturday,the wait was more than an hour and we left. Cut to the following Tuesday, my coworker and I decided to pow wow after work and I suggested we try Superica again. We had back up plans prepared just in case. Turns out we were super lucky to be seated right away and we secured awesome parking easily, too! 

The atmosphere was very different than other places in Charlotte. We joked that there should have been tumbleweeds crossing on the video that was playing on the projector. The restaurant has great attention to detail from the complimentary matches to the beautiful bathrooms. 

We each ordered a drink and got down to business with the menu. The sangria was not very strong but I would recommend their house blended margarita. Sneaky, sneaky. One more and I would've been giggly all night. 

I love that we received chips and salsa to start. The chips were crisp and thin, both salsas were fresh and added flavor to our meal. The presentation of the salsas with descriptions of each was a nice surprise. Not just a filler item, no stale chips and jarred salsa here. We each ordered fajitas with queso fundido to start. It was an insane amount of food. You are definitely getting what you pay for and can choose to share an order of fajitas between two people. The mixed fajitas with shrimp would be my top choice for the shrimp alone! Each shrimp has a sliver of jalapeño tucked into the backside and then wrapped in bacon and I'm assuming deep fried. Ooh... just give me those skrimps! The queso is worth the hype and is great on its own but there are options for toppings. Both plates came with warm tortillas. The fajitas come with an array of toppings, rice and beans with cheese. Do not skip the beans. I ""don't like"" beans. Mm-hmm. Not anymore. Superica's refried beans are topped with cheese and popped under the salamander to become a melty, toasty, dip-able side. Friend, turns out I like refried beans. 

Make sure to check out my picture of my to go box. I'm not kidding when I say I had a ton of food. I went home with enough to eat another meal. We spent a pretty penny: $108 before tip for two with an app, 2 meals and 4 cocktails. And still I say I can't wait to come back! 

P.s. My food was so good, I somehow wound up using my pants as a napkin and I still didn't care. Take that as you will."
1krWQMIXDMAW9RzQg_4xew,5,"Thought I should make use of another buy one get one free coupon for myself & my son. We chose another location because previously when using the same coupon at a different location for the 1st time we had received a difficult time. I was leary about using the same type of coupon again but needed an afternoon pick me up. We went through the drive through and I made sure to mention the coupon, it was like night and day. Meagan whose smile you could hear through the speaker was a breath of fresh air. She said ""no problem"", we got our order quick without any issues. Meagan was super sweet and even my son commented on how nice she was. and made it a point to say thank you and goodbye to her. My son suggested that I should meantion her on Yelp, so here I am. Meagan thank you, you brightened our day!"
bEa6v4yHD5_0DmHSzlL2TA,1,"Went for lunch with team and ordered the steak sandwich medium and it came out rare. Not a big deal. Asked to put it back on the grill and make it medium. Came back blackened, tough on the outside, and still rare inside. Now have a toughened rare steak..ugh.

Advice. Either turn down the heat and cook a steak like it should be. Or dont use such thick pieces of tough meat in your selection. Could hardly chew it.

And no one checked in with to see if it was corrected. Left late and disappointed."
dka8nlxYKgq-yYWBe8c1zQ,3,"To be fair the venue is beautiful, the staff is friendly, the food is good fresh and fine. 
But the price is really to high compared to the quantity. The sea food platter 38$ per person could include 3 more oysters they had 3 little one only, half lobster tail 1 jumbo shrimp
Martini is much more expensive if they use grey goose vs. Absolut, but as we saw Greygoose we believed this was the vodka they would use for vodka based drinks, but in fact it would come with a price tag and the bar tender did not explain this difference.
Overall, food is very good but very  expensive.
I did not like   the tomato salad, tomatoes were not ripe at all nothing there.
Deserts were very good and quantity was very good
200$ total for 2, we took 3 martinis, and 2 starters each, 1 desert each. No wine nothing else"
nfp3EwgZInieR5eke0V5RQ,5,"Best 711 in vegas. Cliff is awesome. Rueben is awesome. Great employees.  Great managers. Great location.  A+ all the way. These guys are good people and do their jobs very well. I live near and shop here about 5 times a week. Always short lines. Pretty much the best gas station in the whole world. It's at least in the top 10. I'll be going there forever.  They've earned my business. Like I said, great people."
VuB8Dc-NEGXdpT4CYAJh1g,5,This store has recently reopened. Very clean and well organized. Wonderful selections in clothing and house hold goods. Great prices. Can easily spend a couple of hours there looking for treasures.
Hi3YHC6GffWakIwXcZGqGg,5,"Well this is the second time I went to this place cause my elevator broke in the driver side, they charged just fine the average is not bad and the gave you a 3 months warranty with your recib also the lady at the office is nice and kind, the workers outside are paisas very nice guys, , well the location is a bit far from the main strip like flamingo and Las Vegas blvd, but is worth the trip to North Las Vegas,"
NUZLaL_LT-3eHvs3No83qw,1,"Worst food I've ever eaten. Ordered the bangers and mash. It was disgusting. I was so hungry I ate most of it because I couldn't be bothered going elsewhere. Tasted like it had been cooked in the toilet bowl. 

My fiancée had French toast and it tasted like sausages. Clearly cooked both in the same pan. Can't reiterate enough how revolting the food was. 

The bar itself wasn't bad. The booth had a high backrest making it fairly private. 

The server was mediocre at best. She tried to take my plate while my fiancée was still eating her meal. 

They only accept visa or cash also. I live near by but will never go back.

Edit: I vomited when I went home."
yeLprf9Eowe6OXtbA-tucg,4,The food was very fresh and appetizing. We were not sure what to expect but were completely satisfied. I especially liked the dim sum options. They had warm and iced crab legs. The pita bread was made right in front of you. They have a huge gelato selection as well as other desserts.
Rsj5bInKp3GV-akclsg3mA,3,"No complaints about the food. My problem with this place is the service. We were one of maybe 5 tables around 9:00 pm on a Friday night. We ordered an appetizer and a couple entrees. Appetizer came out within a reasonable amount of time and then we waited...And waited and that's when things began to go south. When I asked him how much longer until the food arrived (it had been close to an hour). He began to give me an attitude. He told me we wouldn't get our food until we finished our appetizers. WTF, are we children? Do we need to be told when to eat our food? After that, I noticed he stopped coming by to refill our water.

Take your money elsewhere and don't waste your time unless you like to be treated poorly and treated like a child. There are so many other steakhouses in Vegas."
E8pO4OU3U_Prig8iNoBgAA,5,"This restaurant makes you feel special. The staff are very polite and nice. Outside area is full of flowers and quiet, you may forgot that you are in the middle of down town. The main dish prepared artistically and it is super delicious. Do not forget to have dessert there. tiramisu is well made."
OK7dZbugbNg0kMyvk09itA,1,"Server was fine, but the food was the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. I usually love Mexican food, but this was a poor excuse for a meal."
R6877-IWEPMAUxEe7LAKxA,2,"Really slow and inattentive service due to lack of waiting staff - they only had one waitress.  Business seemed to be quite slow for Sunday evening, was not overflowing with people.  Came here with two friends, one had the angus burger with cheese, and the other had the fish & chips.  We split the 6 mac n' cheese bites and I had the honey garlic wings which were slightly too sweet for my taste.  Third time I've had wild wings, might be back again if I get cravings for chicken wings."

_XeI0RROEqlkPrG5PSCKdA,5,My favorite restaurant in Tempe. The chicken Schwarma is amazing. You get a lot of food for the price you're paying and its quality.
AEBkIju2kYQtjvkI4TWbVw,3,"I go here a lot to do homework and the staff is always friendly towards me. Two of the workers remember my boyfriend and I so it's really cool to have them check up on us! The milk teas are satisfactory, I never get boba in them since I hear the boba isn't that great. Obviously there are better boba shops out there but this one isn't bad at all! I always get the curries when I'm here and again, while there is better Thai food out there, the curry is not bad! I like the spice to the yellow and red curry. They always come out extremely fast and piping hot which makes me question what they're doing back there to make it come out so quickly.  The chicken is a bit rubbery and I don't enjoy the texture; I might just get tofu next time. Would've given three stars if it wasn't for the bomb staff and cool games. They have cards against humanity here!!"
nhtS-XSXcT8lMIj1XWMg1A,5,"If you haven't been to a hakkah restaurant before, then you are in for a treat. If you have, well now you don't need to travel to Scarborough to get it! 
This place is great. The food is delicious, serving size is plentiful, and the price is great. I had Manchurian paneer last time, which wasn't exactly the greatest, but I've had it before then and it had always been delicious (so maybe just a one off thing). Hakkah styled noodles are a must and the soups are fantastic. 
Try this place out. For the price, you really can't go wrong! :)"
OqPQxaJVxtn_BPoMstjA8Q,1,"The grooming department service was terrible. The staff are not friendly at all and weren't helpful. When we walked in for our appointment, we got a ""what do you want"" style of greeting. They didn't want to answer questions or even acknowledge us. These aren't the types of folks Id would want to leave my dog alone with for a few hours."
uhVLEIXOMDOzcNcWSU0cQw,5,"I love this place!  They are located inside of a Gold Coast Casino.  Whenever I'm in Vegas, I have to stop here for their dim sum.  I have been lucky to dine in at times when it wasn't really crowded, but I have seen those long lines.  I love their shumai and hair gow.  Their shrimp noodles are even good.  The skins are not falling off and the fillings are just right.  I like this place better than Chinatown in LA.  The servers didn't seem really friendly, but attended to the table and brought whatever was needed so no complaints."
mw0yumXA9xoAi96yYAvydw,4,The crepes were delicious the service was outstanding I went there with my grandma and my honey earlier this morning and I would definitely think about going and eating there again in the future.
swG8eNMXwbP8Krt5VxggaA,3,The pasta is quite good and the place has great ambiance and view but I wouldn't recommend it because it's extremely pricy for the quality.
ge9ZwUnGH_bF36S3sAEZ8A,5,"We've had dinner here a few times and it's the best Brazilian restaurant in town. One of my favorite date night places. Ambiance is top-notch and the service is always 5 star. The food is delicious ---  flavorful and options are aplenty. The variety of foods at the salad bar is great. The best bread (the little balls with cheese inside) I've ever had. But, hands down, Via Brazil has the best happy hour menu, food and drinks, in town. Love this place!"
qRaqf-IOVGeS93hLKwSZ_Q,3,"So hard to post review about this place, the hotel room was very clean, loved being greeted by a housekeeper guy; he told us welcome and gave us a smile that made us feel cared for. 
The room was quiet and very comfortable, we arrived and decided to go down to the casino for a couple hours; downstairs the service was totally the opposite way, the waitresses were so rude and unfriendly that after only one hour we decided to switch casinos. These waitresses had such an attitude that made us feel unwelcome there, I don't know what is the difference in training between housekeepers and waitresses but believe me they have a lot to learn for the people cleaning the rooms, my respect for them and shame on the waitresses, hope management sends a supervisor sometime and they are caught being rude and unpolite.
I would give the hotel five stars and the casino one, is does not sound fair but that was our experience.
Would definitely book at the hotel again but will avoid the casino"
cQGIZxNDja4do3WWnHG31g,4,"With the restaurant being close to the strip and UNLV, I was a little surprised that it was relatively empty the times that I went. The lunch specials are such a good deal considering what you get for an affordable price (choice of entree, soup, and rice). The owners are really friendly and it's clear that they put a lot of effort towards the food and service.

It's good to know that I can get authentic Chinese food near where I live and the location is excellent. The only issue I have with the restaurant is that I wish parking was more accessible. From the times that I've been here so far, it seems like a toss up as to whether or not you get a decent parking spot near the restaurant. Other than that I do recommend Mr. Beijing as they really do cook up some great food daily!"
oftK0ATquBo4pdst1-BBBA,1,"I absolutely loved this store the first couple of times I went. I'm in Phoenix for a short period of time for job training, and I've been here several times getting gifts for friends and items for myself too. I've also brought in more business by bringing some of my friends in with me. My most recent experience just made me super uncomfortable. One of the employees followed me around the store the entire time I was there and stared at my every move. I'm honestly offended because I've spent so much of my money here and to be made to feel like some sort of criminal is just unacceptable. I understand watching out for shoplifters, but it is inappropriate and unprofessional to make your customers feel this uncomfortable. Unfortunately I will not be spending any more of my money at this store and I hope they work on the way they treat their customers. Highly disappointed."
5qVRWs-LXDxh4c68tpZN5w,4,"I booked a table for 10 on a Saturday night  and the whole group was very impressed!  Good cocktails (although the drinks service was on the slow side) and the various smoked meats were delish!  The pulled pork was my favourite, you could tell it was properly smoked and not just done in the oven and then doused in smoky BBQ sauce like some restaurants do.  Good brisket, yummy ribs, and gooey mac and cheese.

Planning to try brunch this weekend!"
Ci3CGw4KLHYNrnhSAr22gA,3,"Burger and Fries $16!

Luckily, I had a Groupon to use for this purchase because I thought for a burger and fries (no drink) for $16.11 is pretty pricey. Not to mention it was difficult to find this place inside the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. Coming from Mandalay Bay we had to cross the Luxor and into the Excalibur and go down the escalator to get to Johnny Rockets. The nice part was we didn't have to walk outside in the hot weather to get there.

After placing our order I was surprised that I was given a transporder machine thingie that buzzes you when your order was ready. Really? I thought it was a fast food joint.  I had the BACON CHEDDAR SINGLE - Smoked bacon, double cheddar cheese, iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, white onion & special sauce. I must say that it was tasty and delicious but for $10.95, uh-uh! The fries is separate at $3.95. It had no taste. I had to add salt. 

There are lots and lots of places to eat in Las Vegas on the Strip alone so it is unlikely that we will be coming back in this location soon. The place was kept clean and staff was okay but must try other food places before coming back here...

gvykON1HIl63tg4VHDPmsg,4,"The pho is a step above the rest. 5th star for the tea though.

Went for dinner on a Saturday so it was busy. Wait wasn't bad at about 15 minutes. Service was good and staff are friendly."
PUjTXo0QsN_vXg2E4hCWMQ,4,"Tree Country Bistro. You're a pretty good thai place, you are.

My friend's stomach was rumbling, so off we went to grab a bite to eat. A cute restaurant in coventry, I was surprised I had never noticed it before. 

I opened the menu and was surprised with all the options. And they weren't americanized options- these were all korean, japanese, thai dishes. Hmmmm...interesting, I said. What should I get??? Per suggestion of my friend, I ordered the green curry. Not as thick as I'm used to (which is good, b/c I don't like my curry too thick), it was full of chicken, carrots, peppers, peas, etc. I like. It wasn't too spicy but just the right amount.... definitely a solid dish. My friend ordered the lychee curry..and man, the mix of a lychee with curry is actually quite quite good.

I'm impressed. Good job. I like you, tree country. I'll be back."

Excellent!  Thanks Blanco!"
Pmryfh1inJ5gHIGx3CajYA,1,"I went there to go through withdrawal.  I had clothes and some stuff, but they decided that my withdrawal symptoms weren't severe enough to keep me (I'm guessing).  They decided without my consent to move me to a sober halfway house.  I got NO choice in going there or which house to go to.  In the middle of the night they put me in a van and brought me to a place that's not near a major street.  This halfway house provided me NO food, no toilet paper, no help with transportation and I was stuck there.  Community Bridges provides stuff like that but the halfway house didn't.  The halfway house was roach infested and I didn't have anything to eat.  I had no way to get anywhere.  I had to find another place to move with a friend or starve.  Community Bridges forced me to go there and it was bad."
V90toAm_vVULVQ_3YqQUOg,4,"Great barber shop. I've been coming here for years and they always do a super job. Be patient though, sometimes it can be pretty busy. They don't rush your haircut even if it's busy. They treat each person like your family. Nothing fancy, just a good haircut at a decent price."
QDwKGqi6_JPtCVFTK2Kz8w,1,"Do not go here! The manager is a complete moron. Like United Airlines, they overbooked and then randomly or deliberately deny people entry despite sending a confirmation email confirming the reservation. The manager is an overweight rude guy. I explained to him that I had my reservation yet the guy didn't even let me complete my sentences, talked over me and was rude. He kept saying, ""I called you to tell you we are overbooked as soon as you reserved the table."" Well, he called me 30 minutes after my reservation was confirmed. It's completely unacceptable to cancel someone's reservation. That's why you make the reservation in the first place. Remember the Sienfeld episode. Btw, I think if they're overbooked they're more likely to reject you if your name does not sound Caucasian... It's the colonial mentality."
57FQOO0t88gFXCCae0K-lg,1,"Better to go in yourself.

It was my first speeding ticket ever. Got them to go in and fight a ticket only to have it reduced by 10km and 1 demerit point. Not satisfactory for $300 worth of work. They also did not want to look at the dash cam video I had available, nor was I able to talk to the defence lawyer who would represent me. Also poor communication and service."

QyASQBmTl3dtjy989O85Ag,2,"I had the black and blue burger that was suppose to be medium but I think the take the black a little to seriously. The thing was beyond burnt. The waitress never asked if we needed anything.  When I did ask for things, she forgot to bring them. 

I don't like writing bad reviews but I felt that I really wasted $42 here."
b-T_u_sKE8-8BanktSGoeQ,5,"The Killers have hung out here a lot over the years. Their good friend / past tour manager Ryan, known fondly as ""The Captain"" for fan club members in '06-'07, used to work here. If you want to spot a TK band member schmoozing late at night, or at least someone who knows them, this place might just be a good bet. Bassist Mark Stoermer said about this place in '05: ""It's giving us a little hope, now that there's a local club to go to that doesn't only play techno club music.""

xVI4QHu96gP9o2RDuKV_sg,4,"Exactly what i expected from a 4.5 rated place. Burgers ranged from 8.5-10 for single quarter pound varieties and 12-13 for double patties. The beef and portions were great and I didn't feel too gross after the meal.

The hand cut fries were generously served and hit the spot. Also the potato chips were the best I've had, and incredibly thin.

If anything the burgers may be a little small if you have a big appetite."
fs3lc_nr_Yaqa4VSGV0icA,5,Such a cute café! The cats were very cute and fun to play with. Definitely coming back for another visit soon.
zi1au7pXyYcMmAcNO5xAXA,1,I needed a local shop near me after a spoke on my bike broke. I use my bike to get to and from work. They took my tire as a walk-in. It was done in a couple hours for way less than I was expecting. I usually go to a big bike shop and I was expecting to leave my bike overnight for a lot more. I will not go back to the big bike shop. I will come back to Bike Zone on Glendale and 35th ave.

Que du bonheur ! des gens conviviaux, ouverts et des jeux par milliers - de quoi réjouir le(s) mauvais(es) perdant(s) pour se ratrapper :) 
A faire entre amis où en couple car ça vaut le détour. 
Une étoile en moins car nous avons patienté 40 min pour rentrer, mais nous avons rencontré un couple formidable ce qui nous a permis de patienter en s'amusant. 
À noter que nous n'avons pas payé le droit d'entrée de 5$ (c'était un dimanche soir). Pourquoi je ne sais pas, peut-être que certains jours sont payants et d'autres non. 
Concernant la carte, elle est correcte, les apéritifs sont de bons goûts et bonne composition, ainsi que les plats qui satisferont les petits creux."
LPhbzJ3KzmdvGcRkRBKSzg,1,"My husband and I had eaten here several times in the past and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it seems that the influx of business they've received through their Groupon deals has taken a serious toll on the service and quality of food. Our last visit went from bad to worse pretty quickly. 

To start out, we decided to sit on the patio, and weren't greeted for about 10 minutes. We ordered the Claypot Chile wings as an appetizer, and waited for over 30 minutes for them to arrive! In the past, the Claypot Chile wings were one of our favorite items on the menu, but this time they were bland (almost tasted like they were coated in oil) and not nearly as crispy as we had grown to expect. The server mentioned they changed the sauce, probably to save money.

For dinner I ordered the Caprese salad with a side of Mac & Cheese, and my husband ordered a Cheeseburger. As I started digging into my mac& cheese I noticed a funky texture in my mouth, and it turned out to be a large piece of paper!! It was so large that I can hardly believe this wasn't noticed before it left the kitchen. Besides being absolutely disgusted, what shocked me the most was that the server didn't even bat an eyelash, and a manager NEVER visited our table AT ALL to apologize for the issue. 

To top it off, in order to salvage the rest of our meal I asked for some balsamic glaze from my very skimpily dressed Caprese salad and my husband asked for some ketchup, and we never received either!

 I am very disappointed in what has happened to the Garage, and will not visit again!!"
avywBCNaHiCRJdOoRG4cyA,5,"After looking at homes yesterday within the vicinity, we were starving. We initially wanted to go to ""off the strip"" but it was a 20 mins wait. The chef/owner was super nice there but we just couldn't wait...STARVING.  So we walked to Barcelona. First thing first, the brioches w 2types  of spread, spicy refried beans and the most insane butter spread. So flavorful!  Maybe because we were so hungry?  Nope, I tried it again after I was semi-full, and still at awe by it. Yum yum yum. Here are the things we ordered: 
-red sangria (yum and fruity, I was so peenk!!! Asian genes *_*)
-clams (fresh and have lots of flavor, w chunks oh goat cheese)
-Barcelona fries (ok, I like the firefly version better)
-sliders (very tasty, and it came w fries, if only I knew, I wouldn't have ordered the full order of fries. Was too much)

food: 4*
service: 5*

yay to Barcelona!"
5z0l1j4Q6gmQ-3u5-2SBow,5,"We loved this place so much we went 40 minutes out of our way to come back a second time!

We loved the pizza and the onion rings the most! We are from Michigan and we definitely wish we lived closer so we could have this more often. 

They owner was extremely friendly and sociable which we liked and there was a young guy working there that we loved as well! Everyone was super pleasant and were a draw in for us. 

Not really seating inside but we stood and ate at a counter table. 

Definitely worth a try! You gotta have it!!!!"
-daMsrs3JXq3N9ML5mWbBg,4,"Went to Blue Ginger with a friend last week, their new opening 15% discount still active. I tried my pad thai and also some General Tso- which was very excellent, not saucy and messy. The pad thai was edible, but too saucy and I know only one other place with pad thai worse than this.

Which makes this place a safe bet that I'll only come back to try the sushi, maybe lunch far into the future."
OymL3STSE_j2oM2Nmqs3Lw,3,"It's Paradise Bakery, so you know what you're getting. Pretty good food, at a decent price. Salads are always great, and you can't beat the cookies. And the atmosphere is pretty solid for lunch meetings, dinner with someone, etc. Very casual, but not overly so.

One gripe I have about this location: service times always seem slower here. Like there's people trying to stay busy doing other things and not exactly expediting the process of moving customers through the line. There are definitely some great people working here, but for example, the other night I waited almost 30 minutes for a sandwich and a half for a to go order. Not worth that kind of wait while my soup is cooling off, you know?"
Lwkr0XKcl1r3TFqDND5zDA,4,"There cannot be many Canadians that have never heard of Tim's so you know what to expect when you go there.  I was very happy to find this place after flying on the red eye from the West Coast and was in dire need of a good coffee and a suger picker upper.

Tim's coffee is pretty good, and apparently many others feel the same.  While I was in this particular store the queue extended at least 5 deep for their caffeine fix.  Not burnt and bitter like a well known place in Seattle, Tim's brew is mild, but gave me the perk I needed even before I downed the chololate donut that I ordered with the coffee (which I later read was not made fresh in the store).

I have my refillable mug and free cup of coffee waiting to be used... and soon it will!"
B_2WXKZno1EMQ2rM0PcE0Q,3,"If you're ever in Vegas and would like a breakfast/brunch spot that's not a buffet, then look no further than the Linq casino home of Hash House.

Unfortunately you will not be immediately seated as this is a pretty popular spot and the wait can take up to 30 minutes to an hour and maybe even more. So I just grabbed a number and checked out the Flamingo mini zoo they had on their property. You could also gamble away your wait time before it's time to eat.

My group of friends got some pretty spicy Bloody Mary's which came with souvenir cups. For food, the Two Sage Fried Chicken Breasts looked amazing which came with waffles infused with bacon (yes you read that correctly), hot maple reduction, fried leeks and served with two eggs. Me being the corned beef hash kind of guy got their Corned Beef Hash which you could tell was not straight out of a can like diners do it. It was a pile of home fries on the bottom and fresh beef on top all held together with your choice of cheese. It was already better than all diner versions of corned beef hash.

By the end of all of this, there was just too much carbs on the plate to finish everything. So I'd recommend coming in on an empty stomach or ordering food to split between two or more. As other reviews pointed out, the portions are massive and a lot will go to waste."

I got the taro slush with fresh taro on top, and it was amazing. The fresh taro really tops it off and makes the drink extra wonderful. The fresh taro was creamy and sweet and added a great texture to the iciness of the slush. I was very impressed and will definitely go here again when im in town!"

rnf07_LzkV3n4Fz6R2O4zA,2,"When you hungry for some express tacos? This is the place to be! It's my husband who loves Mexican food, I mean I like it..but it's not the type of food that I would crave for. This place is okay, but not all the time. There are times that they can be not satisfactory.. There are some incident that they do not put all your orders in the bag. I don't know if they forgot, or it's just pure negligence! 2 nights ago, we went to their drive thru, confident that we got everything, which we had, but soon as we're home, I noticed when I grabbed my chicken chicken burrito, it's too thin like there's nothing in there. So I opened it up, and I guess what? I'm right! There's barely nothing! There was just a tiny little bit of rice, 3 pieces of some tiny chicken, and that's it! 
I am so disappointed!!! Both 2 burritos are the same, the other one is even worse! So we went back, my hubby still approached them kindly expressing our concern and inconvenience, I mean like hello if this thing happened to other people, they would get a very crunchy swearing and all the evil names already! We still chose to be kind. 
They made new burritos for us, I thought they're going to make it up for us, but I'm wrong. They just put a little more rice and some chicken. And gave us some cinnamon crackers as a consolation! Big deal! 
Well it is what it is, and they are what they are! I still like Del Taco better! They have REAL BURRITO there! We only come here because it's the closest to the house."
3rPGK0wfwwLvG8r2fqojhw,5,"I had the pleasure of dinning here for a special event and another evening for HH celebrating my successful accomplishments. During both visits service was exceptional, the dinning is comfortable and a great place locally for something lower key for HH or upscale for a special dinner.  My first visit I had attended a medical conference and we had a prefix menu. I chose the 8oz filet mignon, mashed potatoes and asparagus. I was also introduced to the ""14 Hands"" cabernet. The meal and the vino was yummy! I love the 14 Hands cab so much I found it at Total Wine at a superb price! This restaurant is elegant and you can come in casually dressed.  I am looking forward to future events here and I would very much enjoy if they ever offer live music for a night. I'll be right over! Great place for a date night too. Including a first date. :)"
T1vNC2bzwhYNP0y2B0ekeQ,1,"First thing I noticed was that the bar looked understaffed. After waiting a while I had to get up and ask for someone to clean our table & let them know the two of us were ready to order. When food arrived the hot wings were not hot (temperature wise.) I ordered *grilled fish tacos & they came fried. Super greasy & not that tasty. I was disappointed they also forgot my french fries. When it came, it was way too salty. We ordered two CJ Margaritas & they were too sweet. Overall experience was very disappointing. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Bartender apologized a couple of times for the wait, however it was the least they could do at this point. Only good thing was they had NFL Football on. Btw it was happy hour. Still not worth the wait, food or drinks. Almost forgot!!! Our bartender Todd over charged us $7.98. We had to send the check back for correction. The manager came & asked us about our experience. We were honest. He comp our food. After another apology, we promised we'll NEVER come back."
nG_tNE9W96WBJWaiSft14A,1,"I would just avoid this place. No one is helpful and everyone is in a bad mood. My consultant was distant and not once was I asked about the type of dress I was looking for. The ladies I brought with me picked out the dresses for me to try on. The dressing rooms are tiny and there are no mirrors so my group saw the dresses before I did. My consultant began taking care of another bride before my appointment was over and most of the time she was no where to  be found. One super annoying occurrence was when I was looking in one of the mirrors and the consultant walked in front of me, blocking my view, to help her next bride. I would think you would want to develop a relationship with me on the chance that I did want to buy a dress from her. I assume they work on commission, after all. Absolutely no personality and when she did communicate with me, it was often negative and ""we don't have that."" Even if I wanted to buy a dress, I wouldn't have known how to because the moment I took off the last dress, the consultant was no where to be found. Awful experience and I will not be going to this location again."
dz-4h9vIETHOdfNgksnb3Q,5,Just tried this Chinese restaurant out today for takeout. Was going to stay but time didn't permit. The restaurant was packed which is usually a good indication.

Reminded me of back east style Chinese restaurant.  Great experience! Abacus Inn awesome restaurant!

4WhgMetMEiWt5_lJ-cGatw,1,"Went today after over a year to see if they had gotten any better (I had written a previous not-so-good review).  Seated at the patio, it was a perfect sunny day to sit outside and give them another try. It was lunch time so we ordered the lunch special (burger and fries 7.95) and a beer. We asked to substitute a salad for the fries and we were told no problem. Food was quite good, but when our bill came, there was a $5 fee for substituting the salad.  We would never have done this if were were told we we would be charged 80% more for our lunch for such a tiny serving of bagged salad with no fries. They charge the full cost for another salad.  Simply not honest or good business practice.  I was giving them a second chance and walked away with yet another bad taste in my mouth."

f2qBOBGemiNuZDVWXXJQgQ,5,"I have been searching for the perfect mattress to convert one of our empty bedrooms into an AirBnb room. I didn't want to pay TOO much considering it wasn't going to be slept on everyday but I didn't want a crappy mattress for guests either! At the recommendation of a friend, I was directed to Tuft & Needle's full size mattress. The ordering process was a breeze and I received many emails updating me on order and delivery status. Upon arrival, it came in a large rectangular box. I was skeptical - there is a mattress in this thing?

Once unboxed, i unrolled the mattress, poked a hole into the plastic wrap, and let it slowly inflate. It was really neat watching it expand from a thin sheet to this ultra thick memory foam mattress! I haven't personally slept in the bed but I have had 3 different guests to date, including one who said she has a spinal disc problem. Each of them raved about how comfortable their sleep was! :) They were really pleased with the firmness level (all sleep on their backs). 

All in all: Great price. Great delivery. Great customer service. Great mattress!! Visit them now at www.tuftandneedle.com and if you want to test it out I believe they have a showroom in their downtown Phoenix HQ. Support local! ;)"
Xu6xY38YCAiYLqSMpITKEQ,5,"Went to get oil changed.  Asked them to replace engine air filter and cabin air filter.  They didn't have the cabin filter on hand.  They told me it would be 10-15 mins to get one.  Waited over an hour.  Part was delivered by O'Rielly's.  This place has a 300% mark up.  For waiting over an hour, they gave me $5 off.  My time is worth more than $5 per hour.  What I get for letting them do something as a matter of convenience that I should have done myself.  Also asked them to check brakes which they said was free.  Then they made it out like they did me a favor by giving me a free tire rotation that I didn't ask for and they had to take the tires off already for the free brake inspection so it's not like they didn't any extra work.  And I already have lifetime balance and rotation at Firestone."

(check previous review on Cassellas) They used to have the best cookies here but today's was a bit overcooked. Still good but not as chewy goody as always. The place is too small and was very crowded ( no place to sit for me today) and the service tends to not be very good.While they are fast I don't find the staff very friendly.  It is also on the high end expensive for just a sandwich. I go every now and again when in the neighborhood because I love good sandwiches. I would say better than average but nothing to write home about. Also, a tip- go on off lunch hours."

0ouLGo4hFRjCSQYMM97Mmw,4,Tonight was our first time eating here. It's a nice small very clean restaurant. The booths were very comfortable. And the waitress was very friendly. Our food arrived in a timely manner. I ordered the taco chicken salad and it looked incredible! But on my second bite I bit down hard on a large piece of chicken bone and cracked my tooth. I showed the waitress the bone that was in the salad and she seemed very apologetic and genuinely concerned. They even gave me a $6 dollar discount off our bill. But I know the dentist bill is going to cost me a pretty penny all because somebody cut corners in their kitchen

This will definitely now be my salon of choice!"

dpI8MdTzmRCmA7UitDyELQ,4,"This place  was pretty and my daughter liked it just fine. It's like sitting in a giant living room. You can watch television or read on the big puffy couch while your child's plays with lots of toys or on the cedar jungle gyms.  I would say this place is better suited for younger toddlers. Preschoolers are probably to big and rowdy for here. I met the owner and one other employee the day I went and was a little bit put off. They weren't rude or unprofessional, but they weren't super friendly or warm  like one might expect employees of a children's  place to be. This also has the highest open play cost of all the indoor play centers I've been to at $12. I was satisfied with this place as was my daughter. It's clean and bright but maybe a little too much like ""home""."

This lounge is AHHHH-MAZING!

Now, I'm not a high-class traveler or much of one at all...thankfully my parents are! Must be an American Express cardholder to enter here; I believe entry is free for certain cardholders...for people like me there's a $50? entry fee...but honestly, if you're looking at a lengthy layover, flight got cancelled, etc. you should def consider just stopping by!

There are endless pupu's (you can totally make these a meal) and they're hot items too; not just cereals and breads! The place gives off a very modern vibe with lots of ""pod-like"" spaces, chairs, and couches. Free wireless and apparently there are showers and towels available to lounge guests!

There is really just too many amazing things for me to describe; you just really need to see it for yourself. For the frequent flyers out there, please note that I am not an FF like you, so my review is just as over-excited as it sounds; it might not be as big of a deal for you haha.

gNZsP9jXYofsYHXe0Imobg,3,"I first visited Angelina's Pho & Grill, when it first opened last year, when a friend of mine from our school brought me there. I was happy to see a Pho place so close to school. The food is decent. The price was decent at the time. I have visited the place every month or so and observed that the prices started to rise. However, the quality of the food and customer service stay the same: the foods are just 'decent' and it may take a while to get the waiter/waitress's attention.

Originally from California, I think Pho from Angelina's is no where near the 'authentic' taste. A new pho place ""Pho Viet"" about 2 blocks down is more authentic and is slightly less expensive, and customer service is much better. The owner of 'Pho Viet' personally come out and greet everyone each time I came there with classmates."

So good will be back for sure!"

If you asked for the extra spicy wings they use a homemade sauce that is to die for! It's very spicy so be careful, however! The southern eggrolls are really interesting as they use collard greens. All of the food that I've ever eaten at The Lodge has been great!  They have plenty of TVs for watching sporting events. All in all this is a great place."
a1p6DejIWjw9Q5vCxzEXQQ,5,"This review is a bit late in the making, the amphitheater at Station Square is a great place for watching concerts save for two things. 1) the trains that go by totally kill the sound, and B) the lousy plastic chairs they have in place for seats. Other that that, on a warm summer's eve, with that awesome Pittsburgh skyline right beside the stage and the band playing, it's hard to find a better venue. 

This particular night, myself and YFOJ (yoga friend of Joe) saw Asia (with all four original members) and Yes (I believe this was the 418 version of this band, with a lead singer who was hired for his awesome imitation of Jon Anderson from a YouTube video). It was a great night, I was transported back to the eighties. Ahh, the eighties, me barely twenty years old, big haired women, lousy one hit wonders from British rock bands who had no business cracking the top ten. A flock of seagulls, take on me, super groups like Asia, GTR, and after a ten year layoff from making music, Boston finally put out their third CD.

Asia and Yes played for three solid hours, with Steve Howell wowing us with his awesome guitar work for both bands."
sGE0dH0bCWOe-LQ8Zq-SVg,3,"I can't believe I've never rated the Horseshoe ! 

Hot.tips for surviving here. 

Don't order food
Some taps are okay , some aren't
Order bottled beer
Don't expect the bathrooms to be the picture of cleanliness. 
Be nice to the staff because they have dealt with a lot of drunks and are very long suffering. 
Do expect a decent rock show in the back, preferably from someone local."
NMAzriU1Df4Qa1k-mhcBNg,3,"Update: Maybe I spoke to soon but when I was in they didn't have the foundation I needed and they said they had a shipment come in but had to go through the boxes in the back to find it. She said she'd give me a call once they had it and that either way they'd call me if they didn't have it so I can go to another store. She took my information down on Tuesday, it's now Saturday and I haven't heard from anyone. Really would like to not live off the samples forever and need to know if I should go to another store to get this foundation. What gives?
----
I gotta say I've been pretty disappointed by the level of customer service this location has and have agreed with one of the other reviews about not once being greeted. Normally I don't like being bothered when I'm shopping but when you're spending the money on high quality products, and there are so many here, you definitely want to make sure your getting the right one and being able to ask their expertise and even get acknowledged when you are in the store goes a long way.
I've been to this location 4 times and 3 out of the 4 times I spent about 20-30min walking around and not one person acknowledged me or asked if I needed help. I wasn't sure if I just didn't look the part for them to care about me enough as a customer, either way it wasn't a good feeling and unsure about what to get I left all 3 times without a purchase. 
I decided to give this location another shot, it's the most convenient and I was in desperate need of more foundation. Down to the last drop I wanted to try a different foundation that had great reviews but I needed to be matched. Walking in from the parking lot I was literally thinking how much time it would take until someone noticed me.
Things weren't looking good but I think people should keep in mind to that this is a small location, most Sephora's have handfuls of employees always moving around the store and a dedicated greeter at the front. This location probably only has about 2-3 employees that I've seen at any given time. 
About 5min in Emma saved the day and swooped by to ask me if I needed help. I let her know I wanted to get color matched, let her know my skin concerns and we were off to the races. During my mini consult I remembered what I liked about Sephora compared to most other beauty stores like Ulta. I feel like when you can get an employee then they are devoted to you during that time, they aren't running off to multitask other customers, they don't rush you in and out, they really hone in on what you want and need and want to make you look good. 
Emma did a fantastic job of nailing the color I needed for my skin, we shared beauty and cleansing routines. I just really felt like I could take my time and hers and she had no problem showing me how to use products. I ended up spending about $50 more than I thought I would on other products because I felt like I had that initial direction from her and then I could go through and try other things with confidence. I left the store feeling super happy with my purchases and excited to implement them into my daily routine. While they were out of the foundation I wanted she gave me a nice amount of the product as a sample to hold me over until they got some in. 
Kudos to Emma, I hope when I return that she is there to help, I felt like she really went above and beyond to help me out and having that 1 on 1 time with the employees at Sephora makes you feel special, and it's why I've been moving away from Ulta and willing to come here more and more for my makeup needs."

The owner happened to be the one who helped me (or at least that's the impression I got) and he was incredibly friendly and helpful. I ordered the Hola Amigo, and every bite was true bliss!

My only suggestion would be either better buns or make a selection of buns. The ones they have are those fluffy wonder-bread style ones that you can squeeze into a marble-sized ball.

Nonetheless, the toppings were delightful, the dog was high quality and perfectly cooked, the fries were delicious, and the owner even chatted with me a bit during my meal and was very friendly. I'll definitely be back!"
UzCYT5CJKOSSTG5PKgm4Kw,1,"I've been to other massage envys and never had an issue but the staff here made me mad. I tried to make an appointment online and was sent a conformation email that they would call me. I got no call for 3 days. I called to see what happened, I wasn't really angry at this point or anything. The woman who answered the phone acted as if it were my fault that they never called me because ""they're to busy to answer the emails from there website so I should never have tried."" If you can't do that then you don't need to have the option on your website in the first place."
YZqPaWCSumCnDDNkyT_pmQ,1,"Luxor, what happened to you!? My friends and family used to love it here but I was so disappointed last night. I will never book here again. Checked in and was sent up to a dirty room. Called front desk to let them know and got no apology. Was moved to another room to find out they just implemented a non smoking policy. News to me, wish they would have told me that when I booked 2 months ago so I could have booked else where. They refused to accommodate me and the second room was in a part of the building where everything looked all run down with no view and confusing as heck to get to. The ""Manager"" Chris S showed no concern for the inconvenience I was caused and refused to refund me for my full stay. Apparently they are so hard up for money now that they had to steal my $56 for the first night and only refunded me the next two nights. We called Excaliber to tell them what had happened, and the Manager there was sincere and happily booked us last minute there. Upon check-in at Excaliber, we even received a complimentary upgrade just because of all the crap Luxor put us through. Now THAT'S Customer Service! I'm definitely writing to the GM and Corporate about this horrid experience at Luxor."

hAnOOjGi7qXtzHNI4aW_AA,5,"I have been here before and had a wonderful bartender with great suggestions and energy.  The food was worth the wait and the drinks made my knees week.  Went here last week and oh how things have changed. 

The energy of the place on this particular Friday night, was like a hospital waiting room.  Our bartender Anthony looked like it was his first day.  When I asked if the white or red sangria was the better choice, just to start conversation, he said ""well what do you like better?"".  I tried again with asking what appetizers were good and he looked like he would rather be someplace else and didn't have a suggestion to give.  I immediately turned to my friend to see if it was just me and he said ""are you ready to leave?"".  We had one drink and ran out of there.  There are too many great places to spend my money, I don't need to go here again."
5kazoXBmK6CfSJz_3NSTCQ,2,"We like the food and prices are reasonable. Our biggest complaint is the service. It took a bit long to get a server to come over and then it took our server a while to get our bread and drinks. They really need to develop a better sense of teamwork.  While waiting for things there were numerous servers standing around gabbing. It really gave us the impression of ""Not my table."" ""Not my problem."" Only other complaint is they need to get some rinse aid for the dishwasher. I had to dry our bread plates when the hostess gave them to us.

Ok so it's about 2 years since the previous review and not much changed. Our server tonight was not very good. We waited longer than we should have for her to come over and take our drink order. After waiting a long time for the drinks, they came and I had an incorrect beverage. She finally came back after 10 minutes and when I told her the drink was wrong, she laughed that she had given my drink to someone at another table. I was wondering why she waited for me to point that out to her when she had known that for several minutes.  I asked her for a straw when she brought the replacement beverage and it took about 10 minutes to get that. We put in our order and it  seemed to take a long time for the appetizer. We saw our dinner come up from the kitchen because we were sitting right next to the area by the open kitchen. Our server was busy stacking bowls and plates and we watched our food just sit there. During this time there were lots of servers and employees kind of standing around and no one bothering to bring us our dinner. When our dinner was finally brought over, you will be shocked to find out all the pasta was iced cold. We had to go up to the staff who was busy chatting and ask for a manager. He was apologetic to us, but when he went back to the open kitchen, we could hear him laughing at us with the chef. (Seriously, like he forgot this is an open kitchen area.). The server came over and was mortified that we had spoken to the manager. She never once apologized for anything.  He brought our pasta back and it was--meh. A lot of the noodles were stuck together and we don't think we got the garlic oil sauce we had ordered.  Another manager came over and told us he comped our two dinners which was the right thing to do, but we are not in a hurry to go back there."

We got to chatting a bit, he gave me and my wife an upgrade...didn't ask more than once if I was covered with my insurance, and gave me the paperwork...no more than 5 minutes.

Folks checking out the car were expedient.  Gave me the keys, allowed me to check out the vehicle for damages, turned it in and took off...3 minutes.

Great car..slow..but clean.  Returned the vehicle with no problem.

Not sure if I was lucky or if I just had the right people..but I couldn't have imagined a better experience...especially on Thanksgiving day."

h4Fa9FrHWKBFNUqn4j5pvw,3,"Came here for a tire fillup. Despite being one of the smaller locations, this place gets the job done efficiently but space is an issue. The parking lot might be spacious, but the actual establishment has a sort of ""crunched"" feel to it. In other words, while you're getting your tires filled up with air, you have to deal with having your car parked against the open garages and incoming traffic. 

Since the lot is shared with Krispy Kreme and a Jiffy Lube, you get shared car traffic from both businesses.

Still, somehow they get the job done, so credit needs to be given where credit is due."
gnGFWEHk8jKF183L1jDVFg,3,"I have visited this restaurant multiple times, mostly as a part of a large party (greater than 6) and I'm impressed at the quality of service. 

The ambiance is nice and the belly dancing on Friday nights are pretty good (people really get into it!), although it does get loud due to the music. 

The staff is pretty friendly and generally let you know right away if something is not available and suggests alternatives. I have found that some of the tables do not have the necessary spoon/fork/knife at times and the staff does not bother to check that.

The food is generally good, but I have been disappointed once by the okra curry (bhindi masala), it was not what I expected. The quantity of food is good and for $20, we usually end up eating a lot and even taking some food home. 

The free Chai (tea) is an added bonus!"
PXSeBU0i_ePq4azM54ubtQ,2,"I've enjoyed Chipotle and Qdoba...figured this would be good too. Recommended by a friend. Nope...don't trust his food judgement any longer. The food was tasteless. The meat, which was supposed to be somewhat spicy, had no flavor, and was dry/overcooked.  Even with a fairly flavorful sauce over the top, the food was bland.  Overall, I was underwhelmed. I did not finish what I bought, and tossed it. Typically, leftover Chipotle follows me home. 

Also weird? The staff behind the counter shouting chants. Thank you, I don't need a cabaret, just my lunch please. AND STOP SHOUTING AT ME!!!   That's as weird as coming across the WalMart employees doing their little pep rallies out on the sales floor."

Both were real good and very fairly priced in my opinion. We had 4 beers and 2 entrees and were out the door for about $40. This same meal at my local spot in Cali would cost me at least 50% more."

Make sure to ask what the seasonal shake is and if you don't like it, you HAVE to try one of the other flavors. You won't regret it. This is a great modern burger joint that always has us coming back for more!!!!"

I ordered another pizza, thinking it was a previous fluke. It has now been an hour and twenty minutes and I have called several times and they keep saying it is on the way. I live less than ten minutes from this restaurant. Seriously, if this store wants to continue business then perhaps they need to fix their delivery system since it is atrocious."
VZ6de4D89-ux-EqT2NTZ5w,1,The day I watched the receptionist PUNCH a dog and wind-up to PUNCH it again. I knew this was not the place for me. There is no excuse for this EVER. The dog was chained up and was not a danger to anyone. The lead instructor/groomer watched all of this and did nothing. There are too many other grooming salons/schools out there that treat both dogs and customers with respect instead of neglect.
MX_iKpi8j8RtK6yRTxGqCA,1,So unhappy with my experience. I have given this place the benefit of the doubt one too many times. I've come to the conclusion...they are just lazy with their work. Won't be going back. And they should lay off with the overly pushy sales pitch regarding their memberships.

I asked for the usual toppings from other shwarma places and they plainly said ""no"".  Very impolite and not friendly.  I told the guy behind the counter shouting at the crowds to come for their food (presumably the owner), that some of the topping should be allowed and he tried to upsell me to order one of their salad.  Bad food, small portions and bad service, why bother being open?"

Until I met Cassidy and her awesome team!!! WOW, these guys are in top of it, always pricing out better options for me, on top of my payments and making sure I'm always current.
I would say the best thing is the personal care you get, it's as if they actually care about saving you every dime (even when you don't care for it) while maintaining a booklet proof insurance coverage for you and your loved ones.

The Puppet Master props were really neat to see in person. The highlight of the tour was when we ran into Tom Devlin going into his workshop and he invited us in. His workshop is filled with masks and equipment that he is currently working on and was so happy to explain what he was working on and where we would see it on the big screen. I look forward to visiting when the museum expands!
VccS4niaCOppY2IOCibhqw,2,"I've eaten here a lot especially since it's open late hours.  Usually the food is pretty decent.  Tonight, however, my food was atrocious.  I ordered the spicy chicken.  The chicken was spicy alright but that was about the only thing I could taste.  It came with stir-fry vegetables which were equally tasteless.  I ended my meal full but extremely dissatisfied.  I expect that kind of food from a cheap Chinese take-out joint, not a place as popular as Naked Fish."

Came here for lunch and the spicy dumplings are amazing. After a recommendation from a friend, we knew at least two orders were needed.

The beef noodle soup and HK wonton soup were flavorful and not too salty. The stir-fried Shanghai noodles were extremely oily and seemed a bit too much like noodles I would find in Shanghai."
pC4Sy6ifn3IsSINB2jhDvg,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Here's a tip... STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! It's not as if there aren't plenty of other hotels in the area. I had to stay here, there was a convention I had to attend for work taking place at this location. The conference will most likely be here next year too and I'll make sure to stay somewhere else. 
The food is gross and overpriced. The service was not good. As soon as we landed we attempted to locate the ""free shuttle"" that they advertise for bringing guests from the airport to the hotel. When we couldn't locate it we called the hotel and they told us that the shuttle had to be reserved 24 hours in advance and it was full for the day. He was incredibly rude and in hindsight he should have prepared me for the customer service standard this hotel holds.
The worst part of my stay here was the customer service (or lack thereof). The temperature was in triple digits so we decided to try the pool. There are two pools (one large one  and one smaller one that is probably for kids) and when we got there the larger pool was fairly empty. We laid by the pool for a little and then I started to climb in the pool. After a few minutes of wading around a life guard whistled at me. Apparently they were cleaning the pool and guests weren't allowed in due to the presence of chemicals. No sign, nothing stating this. I would have appreciated some type of warning before stepping into a contaminated pool apparently filled with cleaning chemicals but oh well. After I got out I noticed other guests making the same mistake and I even heard one remark, ""why isn't the pool roped off?""
So everyone starts gathering in the smaller pool. Not even 15 minutes later everyone is kicked out of that pool as well. Apparently it was also contaminated. Lovely. And once again, no warning sign, no roped off area. Again I saw many people walk into it not knowing it was contaminated. Eventually we went up to the room because it was clear we wouldn't get any time in the pool.
We decided to come back later at night to use the hot tub and relax. There is one hot tub with a sign at the entrance clearly stating, ""No children under the age of 16 allowed in hot tub area"". However, there was absolutely no one enforcing it. So the hot tub was over-run with children, splashing and swimming as if they were in the pool. We asked the life guard if there were indeed children allowed in the hot tub and he assured us they were not and then he asked them to leave. One parent became belligerent about his child not being allowed in the hot tub and the life guard had to call security. Not exactly the relaxing atmosphere one would hope for. As soon as the life guard left the hot-tub once again became filled with children. So we left. 
When I got back to the room I called the front desk to tell them I was disappointed by the events described above. She was not sympathetic and actually told me that it was my fault for not asking the staff to ask the children to leave the hot tub. When I told her that I did and it didn't help she then told me I should have called her instead. She then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing she could do about it but would I like a $15 food credit to my room? I would have much rather appreciated a caring/understanding/apologetic customer service representative and no food credit rather than receiving a measly $15 food credit and having to deal with the rude and condescending representative. 

TL;DR
Rude staff, save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else. Don't plan on using the pool even when it's 100+ degrees. This place is cheap and you get what you pay for."
sgDRWBYdsO996xI4hTOEbg,5,"Kidfixers is the best!

V6X56stgAKSGzpaLEagKOw,2,"I truly find the interior design of this restaurant to be borderline appalling. I don't know how you're supposed to enjoy your dinner with multicolored lights constantly giving you a headache. Perhaps it's enjoyable for some people (i.e. small children and people who are overly fond of 'busy' decoration), but I'm not one of them. The staff was rude and not really interested in giving you the time of day unless you were ordering copious amounts of alcohol. And the constant barrage of music rolling in from the casino downstairs was just adding insult to injury. 

We didn't try the food (so please don't use this review as a basis for that), but we did stop in for one of the ""giant brownie sundaes"". I will give them credit for having one of the largest sundaes I've ever seen. This thing was so big, in fact, that the four people at our table couldn't manage to finish it. The quality was so-so. The ""home-made"" brownie bites seemed more like something you'd get from a grocery store and the ice cream was okay, although I would have liked a better chocolate-to-vanilla ratio. 

Price-wise, it's not bad. You could definitely spend a lot more money for better food, but if you're on a budget and you don't mind the gaudy atmosphere and poor service this place may still be a good option for you."
1HHbHs1p8scWrjAyhFAx1w,4,"Restaurant review
Being 2.5 hours away from Chicago, I am still looking for a great modern America cuisine restaurant that is not simply a steak house. Silvercreek is likely the best that Champaign has to offer, but it still falls short of a 4 or 5 star dining experience in Chicago. As soon as you step into the restaurant, the all brick wall and wood ceiling interior adds a bit of class to your meal. We went in the summer time, but I can imagine how rustic it would feel in the winter with the large fireplaces that are along the adjacent wall. The server was quick to take our orders and get the kids meals out first with the appetizer. We went with the appetizer sampler which had the shrimp cocktail served with blue cheese mousse with cocktail sauce (FYI they serve it in such a weird shot glass that I thought it was an oyster in cocktail sauce....), calamari fried exceptionally well, marinated olives with a sweet zest, and duck prosciutto wrapped dates. It was nice trying a bunch of apps on plate. My duck entree is where it losses some stars as only 3/4 of this was cooked well, the other 1/4 was too well done on the chewy side. The cauliflower and parsnip puree along with the shiitake mushroom roasted cauliflower complemented the dish well especially the freshness of the vegetables. I am also very concern why there was a dark blue discoloration in the duck breast as noted in my picture. The redeeming quality is the extensive options on the menu and some farm to table elements.

Pros: refined menu that utilizes many components to the dish, special dinner menu, Sunday brunch

Cons: What is up with the blue discoloration in the duck breast and 1/4 of it was way over done

Hidden deals:
1. Sunday brunch buffet- I need to come back and give this a try
2. Pre-fixe menu- not advertised on the website 3 course meal for 29.99
3. Global Wednesday- unique foods from around the world
4. Live music Friday night"
hSw9DZYtaqcsdttish-n8w,5,"Good food and prompt service. 

I went to this restaurant last week with family and I was pleased with the taste, quality and the variety of food on their buffet menu. We will definitely visit again on our next trip to Vegas."
rT8RmfP0M5wqT7lG3oG0rw,4,Good atmosphere. Pineapple Curry is great!  Lots of great flavors and just a little spice.  Pineapple and cashew rice is also very good.  The Evil jungle princess had fresh ingredients and put together well but it wasn't for me.  I will try Larb and a few other things next time and rereview.  Place was packed when we went but not a long wait to get a table.
CAI5MHuJ25vpoEXzQlKddQ,5,The food was great and my friends REALLY enjoyed the cocktails! Try the devil eggs and the wings were soooo good. Definitely worth trying.

a3xfKUoHiIkHxRREDsFj0w,4,"As far as Walgreens goes, this one is better than most. Of course it's right across from the ""Taj-ma-Teeter"" on Morrison....so the neighborhood is pretty snazzy.

Look it's clean, well stocked, and has a pretty good staff. 

Not sure there's anything else that stands out....except not as many bums/homeless hanging around the parking lot. :-)"
LGmLecpvUj5OrcUU90rNuw,4,"This place is ridiculous. Believe the hype! The portions are obviously enormous, and even the bloody marys are huge. Service was GREAT, but the ambience is a little chaotic. It's fun though! But expect some noise and fluorescent lighting. But that's the whole kitschy vibe of this place! I got the chorizo hash and it was outstanding. Everything was solid. Really enjoyed my time here!"
mLKukZlaq_7XFrXjnG6AVQ,3,I dont know i liked ube milk shake but i dont know whats special about this except decor i liked how they decor the drink also my friend tried the most poppular drink manggo something it was yuk we just throw our drink away

4-ssmIDV5pwhlMDrUpPI1g,1,"Was going here when they first opened, service was good at first. Then started going down hill from that. My gel would chip off within 2 days. Last time I went here I went with my mom. They noticed I had eyelash extensions.. one of the ladies that worked there started talking crap about my eyelashes, then told my mom she needed her eyebrows waxed. Then when my mom told her no she got all mad and said they were bushy. I will never go back here again, kinda sad cause I liked going there at first but not anymore when they talk crap about there regular customers. My friend went here too and the guy couldn't even do her nails right because he left a buncha air bubbles with the gel with fuz, (which this has happened to me here twice) she told him to fix it and he tired fixing it and still didn't fix it she told him to stop doing her nails and she left. By they way if you go for a service they take 3 hours to just do your nails! Not even pedicure included. There slow! I will never go back."
mhYPRBWcfqnHn6h5dgyQzw,5,Best subs in Montreal! The pizza is also excellent and more NY style than napolitani style pizza. It's not a pretentious place and the quality of the food is what keeps people coming back after all these years.
eOCfyDBbIdpLZx6b4D8-1Q,4,"This is a great place for breakfast or lunch.  Their food is VERY good.  When crowded, the food will arrive slowly and for one person at a time....... The staff is very friendly and the prices are not bad.  You can do some people watching while here as it is on Mill Avenue and it seems to be a college kid hang out (don't let that scare you as the crowd is very diverse)."
77oTMX2SDNc-18c_Ly8vDQ,4,"I love this place for its salad!! This was the first place that I had the ""Pittsburgh Salad"" and I have been hooked!! The french onion soup is also very tasty, but the other stuff on the menu is okay- Personally stick to the salads, soups, and calamari!! It is a bit pricey but its worth it, once in awhile!!"
W8WnGODtxRswKlyfJa4Fog,1,"Just like Taylor, I just had the same experience when trying to make an appointment with this office.  I was asked about my insurance before my question of whether or not they are accepting new patients was even answered.  I was told November is the earliest new patient appointment and when I said I would like to move forward, the female I was speaking with, I think she said her name was Mary but she said it so quickly I can't be certain, placed me on hold.  After 5 and a half minutes,I hung up.  Poor potential patient experience!  I am calling for help, not to have my time wasted.  As an individual who works 60 hours a week, I don't have time to sit on hold, especially when you are only taking appointment calls between 8:30am and 4:30pm.  If she had come back on the line to provide an update, it may have evoked a better response but when you are forced to call for an appointment and cannot make an appointment online, the staff needs to be more on top of their game."
AWv9gC844FOOreWGxW7bBg,5,"Let's be real for a second..Truly good pizza is not the easiest to find, but Amano will stop the search for your new go to pizza joint. They also have a pretty extensive menu of pasta dishes and dinner dishes, though I did not try them when I was there. My family and I walked in on a Saturday night looking for a table for 5. We were immediately greeted and seated by a gentleman working behind the counter. Their dining space is small and intimate, but still a good space for a large group. Shannon was our waitress and she was honestly great. She made suggestions when we asked about different foods and wasn't that over the top, annoying, wannabe nice waitress that I seem to find too often in Vegas. Moving on. We ordered the Chef's Special Pizza, garlic knots, and goat cheese and beet salad. ALL OF IT WAS GOOD. The salad ingredients were fresh, the chef's special pizza had a perfect crust and delicious truffle oil on it, and the garlic knots were straight out of the oven. For dessert, my husband ordered the Cannoli. They come in a set of three and had this yummy, light filling. I usually refuse to eat cannolis because they're too heavy, but these were great. 

P.S. they do currently deliver, though they will only go within a 5 mile radius. Just something to keep in mind if you're hoping for delivery. 


See you all soon!"
e55cYCYlrorBjQFT_RxrVg,4,"My son loves this place. The turkey sandwich is made from real turkey rather than lunch meat, which is a nice change from typical sandwich places. Also, they are very happy to replace a sandwich if it doesn't come out as desired. 

Their chicken noodle and portobello artichoke soups are delicious, and their bread ends make great toast. Just be sure to get them early, because they sell out."
tTMQJRsX71HoszmYQSdh7A,2,"Sad to see this once proud brewery rest on their laurels and slide into meh-vile. They have not kept up with the times. They pretty much make the same  beers as always and the newer ones are pretty bad and they charge more for them. Fishing in the Dark is just a bitter mess.  The cover over the beer garden was it for me. Made a cool space an eyesore.  And get rid of the bands.  No one listens to them, and most of them suck."
4HXuQbxfTch3veYvoQl5rA,2,"This place is going on my blacklist!!

What's wrong with all these yelpers and their taste for Japanese food? Or Am I the weird one here? Honestly....4 stars?

Let me start by saying I did give this place 3 full tries. Each time ordering something new from the menu. Its a very convienent place for me to drop by since its so close by to my neighbourhood. 

Disappointing....

1st time I went here I ordered the usual benchmark Japanese food. Sashimi platter, Kaiso salad and some makimono rolls etc. Let me say, for the price paid it is definately NOT worth it. Be prepared to be hungry afterwards. The portions are small and the fish is comparible to any AYCE japanese place, except you can't order more. We also ventured out and decided to order the SUSHI PIZZA, which in my opinion should be renamed sushi FEETsa. It smelt like my feet after a week of going camping with one pair of socks. It was also rock solid and each bite I thought my tooth was going to crack. ALL these people raving about it are either working there, knows someone that works there or have no taste buds or sense of smell. (Sorry if I'm being harsh)

the 2nd time I came here we hesitated but didn't feel like cooking ourselves and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I ordered the Zosui and my gf ordered the Nabeyaki udon. they were both Meh. My rice was pretty damn soggy. almost like a risotto but far more bland. How can you screw this simple dish? *sigh* My gf's order was ok but for $16 bucks premium it was as satisfying as bowl of instant noodles with ingredients bought at any chinese grocery store. 

And the 3rd and FINAL time we came here (recently) was the final straw. We order the Shabu Shabu hot pot. Which we were craving for since last week we had an awesome chanko nabe. the verdict: IT was flipping HORRIBLE! The soup base came out as plain tap water with a seaweed floating in it. The ingredients provided were slices of beef (bought at any T&T I presume) and the rest were an assortment of various veggies. for $38 bucks a person.. c'mon now.. I honestly felt like I was on some ""Punk'd"" show and Ashton Kutcher was going to come out with a camera crew after I paid for this.

Nami, We gave you 3 tries. Each time an utter disappointment. My humble apologies NAMI you are officially on my blacklist.

The one star I give this place is for the service. It was actually quite good."
62mt1hb01VTBHzaGM1o0Mw,5,"Great pizza, create your own or pick from one of theirs! Never thought I would like asparagus on a pizza but it's awesome!"
RILsy5YeUeAtGEZ7uRaOqw,5,This is one of my favorite sports bars food is good.. Pricing is reasonable... Staff is attentive and couteous... Awesome place for date night or boys and girls night out...
f-1kc-b0Y1JwJFhGGn6h5g,5,Amazing service. Took my car here that needed an oil change and wasn't blowing cold air. Another place in town recommended a $2k ac replacement. Jiffy had it blowing cold air in 30 minutes for under $200. All while being totally thoughtful and transparent. 100% loyal now to this place.
9hZXChxV2SwRPsICKT2pew,3,"$15 for lunch AYCE bbq. One thing I didn't know was that all the meat and sides are buffet style so you have to serve yourself and bring the food back to the table. Some of the meat that we selected was tough - the only thing that wasn't tough was the spicy pok short ribs. I enjoyed eating copious amounts of salad after a week-long binge on junky foods but still, for $30 total I felt like we could've gotten better cuts of meat. 

Also, they charge for leftovers here so make sure not to take too much meat when you first start cooking or else you'll be overwhelmed."
6sjw7YGN0n0PWraNNCPqHA,2,"Man I am so bummed about doing this.... But I have to. This rating got two stars because even though the girl helping us was nice, she had no clue what the hell was going on. I called prior to coming down to see if they had the heart pizza yet. She tells me um I think they start in valentines day. (Um that makes no sense) so whatever, we go down to get a pepperoni pizza. We order and then she takes the guys behind us, order. That's when I notice the sign, heart pizza with free cookie dough. So I ask her. She's like oh I have no clue when it starts. (Face palm). So she offers to call and ask the manager, I said no don't worry about it cause I didn't want the guys behind us to get stuck waiting. So at the end she calls the manager, come to find out the were offering the heart pizza. Needless to say. Annoyed. Buiuuuut she was super nice. (Hence the two stars.) I won't say much about the quality of pizza, you can see for yourself by the pictures. Let's just say I will NEVER be back. I will say the hair in the pizza was a free add on, luckily they didn't charge me for that."
7nGkwoFUf3QPj0RroL0BPQ,3,"Went here last night craving Korean food. It is an all you can eat type place but it had a couple of things going for it one they had a regular Korean menu so you didn't have to eat bbq. Which is nice for us non-all you can eat Korean food eating Koreans. 
Two. There were a bunch of Korean people there so it passes the test from that perspective. 
Service was a good very friendly young women. I would go again."
EKLS24od_i1NCGZYvbLXmA,5,Travis Pinney made this experience totally painless. A friend and I went in looking for cars and had lots of questions. He was patient and helpful with both of us as we were each looking for something different. I highly recommend requesting him if you stop by looking for an Audi. Not pushy and is really knowledgeable about the cars they sell as well as other brands of cars if you've having a tough time making a decision. We went to quite a few showrooms and this was by far the best experience we had.
qYG3EvFQE5AMuK3-mp7XNw,4,"This will be the second AC location I have had the pleasure of visiting.  We went on a Monday and it was packed for their ""Mixed Bag"" Monday special, which we didn't really know about, but were out of at dinner time.  Our server was great.  Very helpful to my friends and my husband who had never been to Angry Crab.  I don't remember his name, but when my friend's blue crab took almost a half hour longer than the rest of the table's food, our server expressed genuine concern and strived to make our experience  positive for the rest of the meal.  Management never visited the table, but he said management took care of it.  My two pounds of snow crab legs were perfectly cooked and delicious.  My husband's shrimp were way over cooked but he was okay with it.  

Service:  5 STARS.  Food:  3 STARS.

  I will consider visiting this location again someday and give their kitchen another chance because I have had such consistently great meals at the Indian School Road location.  Until then, I prefer the atmosphere and food in their  (larger) Arcadia location that also has barbeque!"
cQbQ1EA6mv4vfj_gkjM3xw,1,"We're currently here.  The service has been horrible the last few times we've eaten dinner at this location.  So far there has been a long wait for a waiter/waitress to come around for drink orders.  After receiving our appetizer 10 minutes ago, we're still waiting for silverware to be able to eat it.  We've been told that they are currently rolling the silverware in napkins and we will have silverware soon.  Still waiting!  The food is great but the service at this location couldn't be worse."
QpCRqAuHAO5_63_6TC0tIA,5,"Spent a wonderful day here!   This second time around was better than the first time. The  ""Aji Kolada"" was super with the fresh toasted coconut on top.  It was more like a slushy dessert than a drink!  The mini facial experience was relaxing and had all the essential treatments included.  With the use of their amenities available .... steam room , sauna, jacuzzi and pool we spent many hours here.  The radiccio salad was a gratifying lunch.....more so than the lettuce cups, which I ordered on my visit four months ago.  Great, efficient and  friendly service today!  I will be returning. (I had to edit this review to add photos.  :) )"
0sfXnOjkx0pNoLotcwl42g,5,"I have been coming to Anita for years and tonight was the ultimate experience. The food was fresh. Served hot. Amazing service. Fantastic quality. 

Sushi was all right on point which is rare for an AYCE. Wow

Sashimi was so fresh and delicious 

And the new items on the menu were amazing. Shrimp skewers. Tempura calamari. And more. OMG

The chicken and beef teriyaki were amazing. Butterfly cheese were to die for. 

Even he udon noodles were perfect. 


Tonight the stars aligned for an incredible sushi experience. Since the updating and renovations this place is a true hidden gem. 

You have got to eat here."
CRAM0DbKGWSmqlq0KetZ5A,5,Good pizza great service the cashier girl is very nice and polite she has a great smile
p75tcwwruuOzoqSwJUn2pw,4,"Top of the pops when it comes to tacos in town!

Hi Lovers!

I went on a dinner date to this place finally! I have to say I was impressed all around. Great inventive margaritas. I had a cucumber drink that was so refreshing for summer. Chips and guacamole were fresh and fabulous. We decided on splitting chicken tacos and a salmon special. The salmon special ended up being fabulous. A cream and pistachio sauce topped delicious roasted salmon. Homemade tortillas made this a great dish.
The space is very small. You think it is deeper and larger than it really is and I get why it can be hard to get a table. I do like that the kitchen is completely visible and you can watch them cook at the front of the restaurant. The bar is great to try to grabs a seat and actually eat and not wait! It's dark and hip and perfect for a date! ;)

I will be back and you should visit too!"
oOCVjF2Plpz3dgjVYxzhEQ,5,"T-Buds is a much needed addition to this midtown area. 

While I'm thrilled with the recent (read: up to 5 years old) interest in teas, the rise in over-scented and novelty flavoured teas have irked me as a casual tea enthusiast. 

The traditional knowledge of Assamese, Korean or Sri Lankan Tea as far back as thousands of years is not to be compared with tea kitschily-titled Christmas Cuddles and Chocolate Hugs for the middle-aged midwestern Folgers lover. 

This is why I was very apprehensive of trying out T-Buds, as a tea emporium, particularly in this area. I'm so happy to write that I was extremely surprised with the results. 

T-Buds is a very cute tea cafe with a very well executed food pairing menu. Along with their very long list of traditional teas, they serve lattes and other specialty drinks. They also have a wide range of crepes, traditional afternoon tea snacks and salads. 

I tried the Assamese Malt tea with a savory crepe, the name of which I can't recall, but its quite safe to say that the savory crepes are well worth it. The tea was delicious and the service was fantastic. I didn't have to request extra hot water at any point.

I will return and in the meantime recommend T-Buds to all of my friends. Make sure you make a reservation, though. Try the Darjeeling, Japanese Sencha and the Puerh teas. You'll thank me for it.

Study/Work friendly? Not the upper level."
fUKuSeo-bX1iv8HK9btzOg,4,"A little bit more expensive for the typical free chips and salsa authentic Mexican restaurant. Even the staff is dressed up more than you would expect. Drinks are also very expensive but really good. They give you a trio of salsas, unlimited, with chips to start. I always fill up on that LOL. Then I got the chicken fajita. My girlfriend got the steak fajita and my sister got the pork tenderloin brigade. No complaints about any of the food. It was peak dinner hours and there was only one other table in the restaurant besides us- not sure if this is typical for this place. I wasn't complaining though because we were just enjoying each other's company. All in all I would go back. staff was friendly food was excellent. What more could you ask for."
QdAWvMYz-jGvStMgrXsuhg,4,Nothing negative about Panera.   Great food and service.   Just no free cookie....like the ones in the southwest!
A7AcmggVlh7rOXcBR1WzIg,3,"The food if it ever arrives is good. Maybe because they are new, they don't have their act together. For dinner they don't use the carts. I will come back maybe for lunch. We'll see."
wX1OdqCr7ZoUSdbew-9e6Q,4,"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. They had lunch specials going on - I ordered the rack of lamb lunch special, which came with soup (choice of borscht or spicy soup) and side (choice of rice, salad or potatoes). It came out to a reasonable $11.95. 

There was bread and coleslaw to start. I enjoyed dipping the bread in my soup, and the coleslaw was good. I chose the spicy soup which was very tasty. (I tried my friend's borscht soup and I def preferred the spicy one). The potatoes were sliced thinly and had dill which was a nice touch. Lastly, the rack of lamb...amazing! Cooked perfectly. Tender and tasty. Highly recommend if you enjoy lamb."

It's a super annoying environment and they're SO unprofessional there. Every time I go, without fail, there is some ""freind"" of an employee there hanging out. And they're goofing around and ugh... It's just an immature environment. 
But the food is to die for... If only they had a drive-thru."

89bAkoyRHpAtusr_WG9r_A,1,"Only giving it one star because I could not give any less.  Toliet broke and nobody came to fix it for the rest of the two days I was there.  Luckily I had family in the area and used public bathrooms.  Dirty room.  Overall not a good experience.  Probably the worse I have stayed in every.  I am military so I travel lots, have many experiences staying in hotel rooms."
2wlTLLqYa-DbTlrDxicWSA,5,"This is the place to go since the food is so -o-o excellent with a cool ambience and awesome service.  I am from Chicago and it's know for their great restaurants and of course their beef sandwiches, but Roast Public House is right up front with the big guys.  

The menu is so varied that if you want something healthy and light from a delicious Turkey Spinach Panini to their fabulous Homemade Meatloaf, to an incredible Vegetarian Entree, the chef has cast his magic culinary skills just for you!

The quality of the food is superior and the compilation of just the right ingredients seals the deal.  The chef has created sublime sauces and outstanding ""Au jus"" which is the backbone of any outstanding cuisine.  

The beer list is extensive with brews that are off the charts.  We all tried different beers and thoroughly enjoyed them.  The bar is hip happening and a great place to hang out with your friends.  

If you get a chance don't miss the opportunity to talk with the chef (he has so much personality) and of course their incredible fun staff.  This restaurant is quite the success!!"
Ki1DsHz2K-M0bKmKh1d8Mw,4,"Una is impressive, since it doesn't seem that a place like this can exist in Calgary.  Good, unique food with a trendy setting and a great location.  The mushroom pizza is my favourite pizza, with the meatballs as a favourite appetizer.  One pizza, however, is probably too much for the average person, and I always have leftovers.

Also, the last time I went to una, there were four tables with children at the table.  It was slightly unnerving, since I did not expect them, and it is a rather expensive restaurant as well.  Though, they went rather unnoticed, as it is quite loud in the restaurant."
HazZ6cmYmg-gyMs9vX3cKg,1,"BEWARE OF DELIVERY!!! Received a bed and the guys delivering it broke the frame without telling me. They left and when I called the call center I was told I could get another bed delivered that day in the evening delivery. Great! Turns out, evening delivery is midnight! I was not informed the time until I called back the third time (8 hours later, and still waiting for a promised emailed receipt). When I said the time wouldn't work for my young daughter, since it was her bed, which I mentioned several times, they said I had to pay for another delivery. WHAT? You don't tell me the time window when it's set up or the second time I called but now that's my fault! Who the hell delivers at midnight? Then, after holding 50 minutes I get a manager only to be disconnected. Mary the acting manager told me we might get disconnected but she would call me back. Never happened!! I had to call back and was told the manager was not going to be available tonight. Huh? She was supposed to call me! How can she not be available? These people are shysters and don't care about their customers! They will deceive you to get more money."
mR3DoKtjmCHUQyhdclwjzQ,2,Came down to the bellagio for dinner and some gambling. Even though someone was sweeping the floors when I walked in they were pretty dirty. I felt like the security guards were harassing and not in the slightest way friendly. I understand that I'm not the highest roller in the casino but I still feel like I deserve common respect. It seems like the security guards are just running wild on a power trip. Feel free to ask me for my ID but I expect the conversations to be peaceful. I'm not entirety sure why the security guards think there job is to be tough and mean to the guests and not just protect them. Either way I brought a couple grand with me down tonight for some fun on the tables and it looks like I will be finding a different casino to play at.

-NDnJEhckEjD850hM80ZPA,2,"I took my wife to the restaurant for Mother's Day dinner.  We started by sharing a large artichoke stuffed with herbs, bread crumbs, Parmesan and EVOO that proved to be dry and taste deprived.  My wife entree was chicken involitini - a chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto, spinach and mozzarella topped with a mushroom and tomato sauce while I settled on veal scallopini marsala. Both entrees were no better than average though the accompanying garlic mashed potatoes were good.  The restaurant was not quite full, yet the kitchen developed a back up with no explanation provided by our server until I inquired some 20 minutes after finishing our appetizer. Service overall proved to be a disappointment."
K0yerrRqCifo-z56nwVcRA,2,Prices are very high at this Starbucks. It also is not at a good location at downtown Summerlin. It should have its own store front. It's always very crowded and they've gotten my drink wrong twice.

btHDXz0_pRSNSJ2yIJBnIg,4,"After a night on Fremont St. at 2 AM, a bowl of oxtail soup is as good as it gets. We had a 5 minute wait at the most to get in and no complaints with the service. 

The soup was the perfect ending to a great night. The vegetables were soft, the meat  fell off the bone, and the cartilage at the ends of the bones was jelly. After I cleared some space at the top of the bowl by slurping some of the broth and removing the bones (8), I ordered another order of rice and put it all in the soup. I took my time and  spent the next 20 minutes savoring each spoonful of my oxtail/rice soup.

This will continue to be choice A if I find myself downtown late night."

Ordered the Mezze platter with unlimited refills of hot fresh made Pita which we enjoyed.. Also ordered Saaj stuffed with Cheese and customized it with hot sauce to suit our palette.. Enjoyed our menu and left from there feeling full..
XKKEnNY21K9CTETSxxCyRQ,5,"I've been coming here since it was a small quiet coffee like cafe and watching it change over time has been great. This place is amazing. Chef is awesome and always putting together some fantastic creations. Staff is fantastic. It's usually busy so you have to jump to a spot if it opens up and don't come by if you are in a rush. This is a place to experience, not stop and run. Try everything you can Heard they might be expanding??"
JE-HYbMxlwp9aCKavXIjpQ,4,Went on a Tuesday night for trivia and had some beers and food to go. We are horrible at trivia but had fun doing something different for a change. Crowd was mixed and place wasn't too packed. Got the Berkeley salad with blackened salmon and ribs to go. Both were delicious and would order again. Our waitress was friendly and checked on us frequently. This is a standard bar/pub and would go back again.
d-uW42cd-MwuwqyygXankw,3,What was five star was the service. We hadn't been here before so it took a minute to look over the options. Then the guy behind the counter was very helpful explaining what was in everything and what our options were. There was also a guy who came around twice while we were eating to be sure we didn't need anything. But the food was just alright. I would go again and try something different though.
cvumqCD7kjy7STMCf_5JCg,3,"Awkward, waiting in line, a guy in dark sunglasses behind the counter staring at you. Why isn't he helping anyone? Turns out he's just on his break, with nothing better to do. Not the greatest first impression.

Not-so friendly rental agent lady helped me. We had a minivan reserved, but she said there's an SUV available & can upgrade us. So I think cool, free upgrade! Then she says, ""that'll be an additional $78 per day."" What? Why offer it, if it's not free? It's probably my fault 'cause sometimes I DO look that stupid. She never smiled & was a little pushy about getting all the insurance, gas option, etc. I travel often, I know what I want, just listen to me lady!

On the positive side, the KIA minivan was clean, roomy & problem free. The rental agent who helped us when we returned the car was surprisingly friendly & very professional. This last impression, however, still doesn't make up for the first. Unfortunately, when booking package travel deals, you can't always choose the rental provider, so there's a good chance I'll be renting here again."
dFYx8AY6nSZqVepfmemBpw,1,"Took my 1993 Toyota pickup in for a fuel leak. I thought it was the fuel regulator. Turns out it was the fuel dampner.  Originally some confusion leading to a unhappy customer. The manager Tim got involved the next morning, and he was my idea of what a manager is.  After fully understanding what had occurred,  he immediately said he would make things right. And he did. This is the kind of service that would make me a repeat customer."
lZ0Amfutxv739gZmA-EGrQ,4,My second time having Korean and it met my expectations. The place looked a little dark but service was good and also food. I will recommend.
9JKoSDcok37iccQZILZWaw,5,"Had a wonderful dinner here last night! My friend had the burger with goat cheese added on, and I enjoyed the chevaps sandwich, with garlic fries on the side. Both meals were great (especially with the house sauce), but the service was what really made our meal. Our server, Ana, was very attentive, helpful, and genuine, and we were so impressed by how welcome she made us feel. We will definitely be back & recommending, thanks Ana and Royal Meats!"
eIUJv9nWQOyIF-zJYrZj5Q,4,Another hole in a wall place. The menu is straight forward. The food is really good! The portions are large.very satisfied with this place.
TbMCJNm0gmLdUTxLrBIwMA,4,"I can't believe I haven't written this place up yet! 

Fresh is the place I go to when...

- I need to feel ""clean"", or ""detox"" from a bad week/day/month of overindulgence 

- I have an audition/tryout to attend the next day (or a few days before) and it involves wearing a bathing suit or something really form fitting

- I feel like boycotting meat

IN Vancouver, my favourite place is The Naam (open 24/7, all veggies!) so when I arrived in TO, I set out hunting for the next cool veghead place.

And so far, Fresh fills my veggie void. It's not overly expensive (though anyone would surely feel a tad ripped off paying $9 for a bowl of steamed veggies).

You can order tons of sides at $2-4 (hello, yam fries? normal fries? steam broccoli, kale, etc.). I like this arrangement, because if I'm feeling a little naughty, a small side of fries won't kill me, but an appy-sized plate of fries probably would make my butt and thighs upset.

Anyway - I digress. When you get there and if you're bringing out-of-towners, order the Quinoa battered onion rings. It looks interesting/impressive, very unique - you only get 5 bigass rings but trust me, they are worth it and if you start off with those, you won't be able to finish your meal.

Now, for your meal, I highly recommend one of their bowls. And if you get it with rice, request ""more veggies than rice"" - they are good at fulfilling that request. Buddha and Goddess are the best ones, and same with the Macrobiotic (micro?) bowl... clean and simple!

OH - and the soup. Oh, the soup. SOmetimes I'll just go for the soup - a cup or a bowl or a bowl with salad. The soup is great, its just pureed veg at the end of the day but my fave is the Jamaican spinach and zucchini - a lil spicy but great spices. Their soups are always good and they change all the time. 

They also have a prix fixe which includes a smoothie (pure fruit and goodness), appy, entree and dessert all for $21. YOu can't lose!"
25uW6hLDKTQ7ufKvyI4sKw,4,"The broth was very flavorful and delicious, and the meat and noodles were good quality and tasted great.  Service was a little spotty, but waiters were nice and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable."
1pIa3Y6C_HEf4TKVYOfnZA,5,"Jesse the owner of LevelUp Garage Door Repair just left my house a couple of hours ago. My regular garage door service company of 15+ years decided two months ago to leave me high and dry with a system that didn't work. Not even a phone call to tell me they weren't coming back. 

But just as the old saying goes ""one garage door closes, while another one opens"" 

Jessie showed up this morning with a smile, assessed the mess he was hired to clean up and then he smiled again. 

Jesse contacted Genie to diagnose the problem and about 2 1/2 hours later Jesse had removed my old garage door opener system and installed a brand new Genie garage door opener system from top to bottom. This time I smiled. Lol Jesse worked HIS ASS OFF today. And he genuinely looked like he loved every minute of it. 

This brings me to the huge difference between the old burnt out businesses and their miserable burnt out repairman they send to our homes, compared to what I experienced today. 

A relatively brand new business of 2 years and their fresh approach, who's LevelUp repair man is also the owner of LevelUp the company. I mean it's awesome to see somebody proud of what they do AND kicking ass at it! 

By the way Jesse told me he would be showing up somewhere between 9:30 and 10 AM! Huh? Not 8am to Noon? or 1 to 4pm? No? NO! Jessie has eliminated that big crock of bull pucky we have all just accepted all these years. 

I'm sticking with the new guy 
and his new approach! Smiles and all. LevelUp Garage Door! 5 Stars! 
Sincerely,
Gary"
9W3WBCgre11OUGIzkLMekg,5,I am very happy with the services I received.  The entire process was very user friendly.  My request was handled promptly and all questions I had answered quickly.  I'd highly recommend this firm.
NftkcWXF_gtijWWptlE1Iw,3,"Normally, I don't give a business a second chance after reviews similar to what I left for Sanfratello's.  However, I decided to give them a second chance simply because they were closer than my normal Rosati's.

The first thing is that it is not an easy place to find because it is literally buried in the mall. You really need your GPS to find the place.  But it is in the same lot as the Albertson's but closer to Warner than Lindsay.  Once you get there, you notice how small the place is (looks more designed for a takeout instead of dining in like their parent store in Tinley Park, IL).  You do have outdoor seating but that's even small.

One thing I found interesting is how quick they had a pan pizza ready.  I am accustomed to waiting 45 minutes.  They had my pizza ready in 25-30 minutes.

When I got the pizza, I was kind of taken aback because the container looked kind of small.  In fact, it almost reminded me of a personal pan pizza in physical size.  I even thought it was going to be a square pizza because of the rectangular container.

After taking the first bite, I saw that Sanfratello's uses the patty sausage similar to Pizzeria Uno and Due back in Chicago. With some of the crumbled sausage I have had, you do taste the seasonings through the meat.  In this case, I did not.  It did not have the full-bodied flavor I am accustomed to when eating a Chicago pizza.  

The second thing I noticed was the crust itself.  I have to admit I was skeptical that it would be cooked thoroughly because of the short time.  However, that concern was squelched.  However, I am also accustomed to a buttery crust.  This crust was not buttery and even the tops were burned in spots.  

Third was the tomato sauce. The sauce, like the sausage, was missing critical seasonings that provide the usual flavor explosions I am accustomed to with Chicago pizza.  Additionally, I did detect a bit of sweetness with the sauce which is abnormal.

All in all, I would say it's not a bad pizza but this former Chicagoan says it needs a few things that will turn it into a serious Rosati's competitor."
4_-pf6S-yV70MTuMBA56nQ,2,"- many servers, but not much services provided. long waiting when ask for something, besides your server, other servers not willing to help you much.
- price is high, overpriced
- the environment is too business feel
- sushi was good
- we order a raw seafood platter with lobster, it was so so and I went to washroom 20 mins after
- went to another Japanese restaurant after, will never come back again"
u6MYBUH_KJ3bK5RCPE8T6w,4,"For a chain restaurant...I was impressed. We stopped in early in a Saturday and were told it would be a 50min wait but bar seating was first come first served. We decided to look around and found a table in the back corner of the bar. It took a little bit but our server finally came over and took our drink order. He was very knowledgeable with the wine list and my wife went with one of his suggestions for a Pinot Grigio and she enjoyed it. I couldn't decide on an entree so I went with some small plates. I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful but skimpy on the lobster. Next I had a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The salad was rather large and a good value. The calamari was excellent except for the aioli. I tried a little and decided to stick with the marinara that accompanied it. I'm a calamari traditionalist...what can I say? My wife had the pasta Brio which consisted of rigatoni, grilled chicken, and mushrooms in a roasted red pepper sauce. She liked it and so did I. I'm not a huge fan of chains but Brio does it right. We will definitely be back the next time we decide to visit Crocker Park."
D4GuhP25OU8-j18VTYoXuQ,5,"I like this theatre because it's not far from our house. It has plenty of parking as well. Also I haven't seen another theatre where the performers come out after the show to mingle with the audience! The stage isn't that big but it makes things feel cozy. We can get great seats at this theatre without paying ridiculous amounts. They also have some good shows here!

We saw Pavlo in November & that was an amazing show! We even got Pavlo to sign the cd's we bought & had a picture with him. Pavlo is so humble & personable. His guest musicians were also there after the show & we got a photo with Mark Masri who has an amazing voice! We bought Mark's dvd which was amazing! He was so nice too. 

We've got tickets in March for Che Malambo & Rhythm of the Dance. I'm looking forward to those shows!"
b2DY2Pr6O-xFdEhNjY-cGw,2,The only thing good abt Canes is that the chicken is tender. The breading has absolutely no flavor and it's kind of soft not crunchy . They only have one type of sauce. The fries aren't great. The coleslaw is ok but the little piece of bread is pretty decent.
dQ6qnx4ian8-uFLiwL6nwQ,3,"The rating is more about the service department and not my experience with the dealership as a whole.  In 2006, we purchased a brand new Sienna from this dealership and it was the best experience I've ever had with a dealership.  

Since then, we've taken the van there for our regular service work and even had a great experience when our automatic side door needed repair.  The person I worked with went out of their way to get us the expensive replacement part for free since we had been loyal customers, we just paid for the labor.  I've recommended this place many times and have bragged how happy I was with dealership. I had even planned on our next vehicle purchase coming from this place.

My problem is with the last time I took my vehicle to get service work done.  Our A/C stopped working and we took it in to hopefully get repaired along with our normal service work.  Their customer service is great as usual, but my problem is with this quote.

Replacement of A/C Compressor - Over $1900
Water pump and timing belt - Almost $800

I realize dealerships often cost more than taking it to a garage, but this quote is way too high.  I've researched average cost of this kind of service.  And have also looked at average estimates for dealers and auto shops from AutoMD.  

Maybe this is norm for dealerships now.  I've had friends who've suggested that these high quotes are to try and entice a new car sale.  I hate to feel that way, but now I'm starting to wonder.  I guess I'm feeling a little betrayed."
oBeH_hJe99FVCumQPg3quA,5,"Chicken vindaloo is incredible. The manager gave us a great personal touch and recommended dinner. We tried both the cheese and garlic bread, and my friend had chicken makhani. The vindaloo melted in my mouth and the makhani sauce was superb over rice. Incredible place to have my first time eating Indian food."
L6iWLlogaa9ssuh6YIn23w,5,"Every single person that works here has absolutely every reason in the world to be less than nice to people that frequent a Taco Bell that serves booze and yet every person that works here was the NICEST. Like, I want them to come to my house for thanksgiving nice.

I have tons of faith in the human condition already but if I did not this staff would have restored it with their wonderful demeanor. This is 100% not sarcasm. Everyone that works here is very warm.

Those little jalapeño rollers are just cheese and jalapeño peppers in cut up tortillas but hell if they're not fricking delightful. Not as delightful as the staff here, but still."
sLopQtECNXFWVQsyWCsr0A,5,"Impressed with the quality and taste of everything I ordered! I had the soup dumplings, a shrimp and veggie egg roll, shredded pork with pickle noodle soup and the fried pork chop. I ate it all. Alone. It was that good! The noodles are hand made, the broth super flavorful and everything served piping hot. Don't burn your mouth!"
QIa0T6HxEjm_vyX-ukidXg,3,"We went to Vegas 3 or 4 times a year and we've always wanted to visit the famous Gordon Ramsay Steak house in Paris Hotel and tried the Kobe beef ($32/oz) on a special occasion.  We waited and waited and finally here came our 25 anniversary celebration on July 5.  Our expereince started with a smiley beautiful lady giving us a brief introduction of the history and design of the restaurant.  We were told that this steak house is the one Chef Ramsay freqently visits.  It rasied our hope that the food MUST be outstanding.  Our waiter is escellent.  Very friendly, attentive and informative.  Gave us good recommendations on drinks and food choices.   The bread selection was good, foie gras was excellent and the seafood tower was amazing.  But we were totally disappointed when the Kobe beef steak (8oz) and the Royal Long Horn steak came.  We ordered medium rare and medium respectively but both of them apeared to be burnt, especially with the Kobe  beef.  This dish will definitely be sent back to kitchen if Chef Ramsay was on site, REGARDLESS of the value!  We expected the famous Kobe beef to have marble texture and melt in the mouth but it was chewy and blend.  We had Kobe beef steak in Japan before and that was way better.  The Long Horn steak was slightly overcooked too. The sticky toffe pudding which came with the butter ice-cream matched beautifully, however, the coffee we picked was another disappointment.  It's worse than a donut shop coffee !.  Our bill was almost $800 for 3 but with that qualify of entree we had, totally not worth it.  Again, we believe, according to what we saw on TV about Chef Ramsay's high standard and requirements,  he would never allow the entree to leave the kitchen.  After all, the whole dinning experience was like riding a roller coaster ended with a sad face :("
Iu-froD7jvZ1zluc6Y0OEQ,3,"I was recently in Tempe for a business conference being held at this hotel, so of course to save myself a rental and whatnot, I stayed here at the FRCC.  First, like the other reviewers mention, this is a 70's - 80's design, and while my room was somewhat updated, I can see where others have not been.

While spacious for one person, the room felt a little too open with the mirrored closet at the entrance and tile floors reflecting the light around.  Not a bad thing mind you, but somewhat odd.

The carpet was not comfortable to bare feet and was a brownish color.  The mini fridge was spotty at best, and the AC was a tad noisy at times, but I slept through it ok.  Perhaps my biggest complaint was the shower.  It took more than 5 minutes for hot water to come out of the shower (the tub heated nicely however).  Also, the shower head shot the water in a concentrated stream with a lot of pressure, similar to a pressure washer.  Personally, I like my water spread out :)  The wifi was also pretty spotty in my room, often times dropping for no apparent reason.

I would probably stay here again if I was in the area for a conference at the center, but if I had a choice to stay elsewhere, I probably would.

Edit:  I forgot to mention the service....A+ in that department.  Everyone was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way on several occasions to make sure everything was to my liking.  So while the facilities need updating, the staff is perfect as is."

YjZyYRoW3KZERYTVddgTqA,4,"Very good Italian food, prices a little high for off strip local Italian Restaurant $30 for Veal, $20 for Spaghetti, meal comes with salad,  entrees were very good, service was excellent, Very comfortable venue for casual dinner. This was my 4th time back and will go back on next trip to Las Vegas"
M53z0aNqEv2X-HhTOYja5A,4,I loved sitting on the fabric chairs! Such a relaxing laid back feel! I was able to watch a lil sports from afar by the bar. We enjoyed some pretzel fondue. They were more like pretzel rolls that you take apart by pieces and dip into a melting pot of cheese. Then I ordered the grilled cheese with ham and a side of fries. If you're about simplicity and comfort food...park it here. I also tried some fried chicken and meatloaf. After all that...I felt a lil regret.
Xg1EhjLD1GUQFDQlT4IhQQ,3,"Loved the stuffed olives, shrimp brushetta, drinks and coffee. But my daughter and I had the spaghetti with clams, barely palatable. First we were told the clams were fairly large, they were tiny and tasteless. The onions, which were not mentioning in the description over powered the dish. The spaghetti was more like ramen noodles and the sauce was bland and very little of it. The staff was friendly and efficient. We have dined here several times and the food is hit and miss."
JMtzbH8yL-MGOUUsCkOjgQ,5,I always use this grocery store as it has everything I need and it has the best sandwiches around.  Also has a great wine and spirits area with a ton of selections.
P88IEr3M47blqoNU_OBL2w,4,"If I need a new pair of shoes... I will travel the 30 minutes it takes me to get to this location.  GREAT shoes, even better clearances... friendly staff, nice clean store and fast lines.  Really, there isn't much more I could ask for but I would love to see the prices lowered on the non-clearance items just a smidgen.  :)

Edit:  I changed from 4 to 5 stars simply because I just realized this is the only store who ever commented on my review.  Personalization like that goes a long way - that totally deserves another star!"
OM9rLLQ5QnGcEJVRn-AKow,5,"Seriously, what a great company to deal with. I had an external hard drive I've been lugging around needing to extract the data since it stopped being read by my computer a few months ago. After a Yelp search, Desert Data Recovery was one of 10 companies I queried about recovering my data. Nicky, the co-owner (along with her husband Tim) contacted me quickly, and offered a free diagnostic. Very nice and knowledgeable. They offer new drives very inexpensively or you can bring in your own for them to use. Their office is very professional and easy to get to. They stayed in touch with me consistently thought the whole process. Everything great. After I left, there was an issue which they needed to fix and I was already many miles away and could not drive back to them. No questions asked, Nicky had my data backed up to a Flash Drive and had it couriered to me. Wow. I call this EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE. You will to. To all my fellow geeks throughout the Phoenix Valley, I give Desert Data Recovery my highest recommendation."
9TIuB4zTCI2-ZJ-qF18pkg,5,"I bought a groupon for this class and it is fantastic! I absolutely love the variety in the classes. Nicole is an excellent teacher, she is very friendly.

It not only helps you tone, but more importantly relieves you of stress and you go back, being full of love, life and energy. Highly recommend this place. :)"
sr7AQyTItWqT2PdwUhYGoA,1,In my opinion they are very racist.... this Mexican guy wasn't even in line but I was dont you know she called him up to the counter took his order and after he payed for it proceeded to take my order very unprofessional I will no be coming back
59chF5Tn1gTEWqukL7vs5w,5,After years of not going to the dentist I was a mess. I had to get a root canal and a few cavities filled. I was so nervous. I absolutely hate the dentist but that is not the case here! They take such good care of their patients and make it okay to come to the dentist. Not to mention they always remember me when I walk in and they play Christian music while getting your mouth worked on. Great place!!

It's exciting to be there! The food is very interactive and the staff totally get how to throw a party! The cocktail menu is off the charts. Brilliant taste and execution (and super hot bartender) . Well done R and D!"
hWDqjkfLP4CJwV--X5O5Lw,1,"Sadly this place has become like most restaurants in Old Town, watered down. What happened to the margaritas?????! $15 for what?! So disappointing. And the food, so basic. The Mission used to be the spot and could justify those prices with the food and drinks - now it's just...sub par. Such a bummer."

This place is really busy. Yet my boyfriend and I 
had a great experience. Our server was amazing. I forgot her name but I know she's German and Filipino, she was very attentive.

I had ordered the chicken fried steak with a gluten free banana muffin and I believe my boyfriend ordered the 5 egg white omelette with a gluten free banana pecan pancake. Everything was really good."

ZS3pozTIHEWvYb7ZzxUWaA,1,"My friends and I went in tonight to get some wings on our way to work. The girl who took our order was just outright rude. She laughed at me for pronouncing a word wrong?? And when my friend asked if she could get the tenders flavored she rolled her eyes and replied ""uh yeah?"" Like sorry we all don't know how wing stop works? Definitely will not be returning. While we were waiting for our food another couple had been waiting for 40 minutes!!! And when our food was finally called out they got up and asked where theirs were. He replied ""well did you get bone in?"" They ended up just getting a refund and leaving. The lobby was downright disgusting, dirty tables everywhere and a pile of trash trays where they call out your order. Ew.
This place needs a wake up call on not only how to run an efficient store but also on how to treat their customers who let me remind you are the reason you guys are even in business."
7NmJc8jSuZclM2qBTnRz4A,2,"Decent food, family type restaurant. Dining room is jam-packed - a bit snug, elbow to elbow. Meal was fine but nothing to rave about; server seemed very nice but just awful. Very slow and inattentive. Not sure why this place is super popular when it's only so-so."
WKOp6_YHg96ON8EGXoXCwQ,2,"The food wasn't bad, especially considering how cheap it was but I'm giving it a 2/5 for the truly shitty service. I asked the waitress what on the menu only contained seafood since I'm pescitarian, she answered with saying some fish dish. Later she served me the fish with a bowl of noodles and beef. After telling her I couldn't eat that she made a big fuss on changing my order even though I told her I didn't eat beef and said this was the last time I could change my order (even though it was the first time?).

My friend who was with me during this little encounter later told me that someone she came with before also got shit on by the servers for trying to change her order.

But honestly they don't even expect tips so what kind of service was I expecting?"
g8xsuJuDl4gQELpknjlcDg,5,"I'm an avid coffee lover and have gone to tons of cafes in not just Phoenix, but New York and LA. I had never visited Peixoto, since it's pretty far from where I live and even as I was driving over I kept muttering to myself, this better be worth it! But I had an excuse to be in downtown Chandler, and I'm here to report, I think Peixoto has just ruined every other coffee experience I've ever had. They are just that good!
I came to Peixoto and ordered my usual order, something I get at all coffee shops, an iced mocha latte with soy. The baristas told me that the espresso beans are sourced from Familia Peixoto, just like their coffees, which has notes of hazelnut, honey, and berries. There was also bits of chocolate from the local chocolate shop, Zak's chocolate, in my drink, and it was love at first sip- it was seriously one of the best lattes I've had in my entire life! The flavors blended in a way that just made me smile - not too sweet, not too strong, it was just perfect, just smooth and delicious. And again, I have serious lived in places with serious caffeine addictions, and Peixoto's brews are definitely up there. 
I was so impressed, and so curious, and a little terrified, that Peixoto is so far from me that I'd never get to try it again that I ordered another latte, this time from the seasonal menu, the Matcha Mel latte. It was good, not as bitter as some matcha lattes can be, but I think I was still won over by my original order. 
After two regular lattes, I probably was high on caffeine, and there are so many things on the menu I want to come back for! This includes the seasonal Coco Latte that has condensed milk, the affogato with gelato, and the days they carry Welcome Chicken & Donuts, donuts.
I did hear they partnered with Urban Cookies so you can now pick up some brews in Phoenix, but I feel like I will make up some excuse to come over here again to Chandler.
Aside from their products themselves, the staff was extremely nice, friendly and knowledgeable. I learned that they source their beans from Brazil and are all fair trade. I love that they partner with other local food eateries, and even their matcha is supplied by Gotcha Matcha, another reputable source. Much respect and love for Peixoto coffee, I am sure you will see me again soon..."

uZJvywHWmpRfO420lFMllQ,2,"This joint happened to be close to where I'm staying in the city. its also one of the few places in the area open after 9pm. 

The place was happening. I realized later its a franchise in the city. I ordered one of their few vegetarian options, a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled mushrooms. And a side of cajun spiced fries. Both were stupendously good (and stupendously unhealthy). My grilled cheese consisted of two slices of 'bread' (more like savoury pancakes) with heaping amounts of cheese and mushrooms dripping out. The serving size was smallish (imagine a slightly overstuffed egg mcmuffin) but very filling. In comparison they overfilled my serving of fries (and I ate every single one...oh what a carb feast).

It will cost you around $10-12 for a main, fries and drink. I wish they had poutine options, guess I will have to save that tasting event for another local establishment :)"

But in trying to follow the inspiration of Frank Lloyd Wright, it ends up being a squat, rectangular two story building that is mostly forgettable. What it makes up in convenience, it loses in bland furnishings and uninspired food options."
zM7hfGUEKbYQgiB3K7gcDQ,5,"By far the freshest, super cool, Mexican offerings in the valley. A great combination of authentic food with a modern vibe and obvious pride in what they do. I've never brought a guest who was not impressed."
WY5uE_-GZw1M3EaMeAZHqg,5,I just picked-up a loaf of souurdough and zuccini bread at the Phoenix Public Market. I am so impressed with the quality of the breads! The people who helped me at the market were also SUPER wonderful. I will certainly be purchasing more from this company in the future.
1xLcZ9573idpdd5V0PVFvg,5,"Never dissapointed! I moved up to Madison from Chicago, October 2014. I absolutely love the staff and the salon itself is super clean, trendy and always update on color selection. They have the biggest selection of no-chip (shellac) colors I have ever seen. My no-chip manicures last for 3 weeks or more (if I were to let them go that long).

If you're looking for nail salon I highly recommend, Lotus Nail Bar and Spa!!!!!!"
uBBc27APw-AS7And7Pd6jg,1,"I won a ""free"" hotel voucher thing (not exactly free since I had to pay tax and fees) and since I was going to Vegas for a concert, I figured it would be the perfect chance to use it.  The only place in Vegas my voucher was valid for was the Riviera and I figured, ""how bad can it be?""  Old Vegas has it's charm, it's still on the Strip, so I thought it would be fine.

Esh.  Where do I start?  First off, the elevators in the parking structure are seriously scary.  Everytime we got in them, someone would remark that we were going to die, the cables would creak, and it was just freaky.  It got to the point where we started walking the 6 flights of stairs just to avoid the scary elevators.  We also started parking in the uncovered lot just past the garage, just to avoid the elevators!

Check-in?  Slow like molasses.  

Shops?  Lame.  The only good stores are the ABC stores, which have very reasonable prices.

The room?  It looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s, except for a flat screen TV and iHome alarm clock.  The clock still had the wrong time and nobody had changed it since daylight savings ended.  The AC in our room rattled all night and we had to slap the panel in the ceiling to get it to stop.  Every hour it would start again.  We really should've asked for our money back at that point.  The walls were thin so we could hear the guy next door yelling at his kids at 7AM.  The curtains didn't close all the way, so we woke up when the sun came up.

The bathroom was okay, but there wasn't even a stopper in the sink.  I was paranoid I would lose an earring down that thing.  The sink pipe ran into the wall and it was just ghetto, like someone just freehand cut a circle in the wall and stuck a pipe through it.  The toilet was like an industrial toilet you see in public restrooms, so I used my foot to flush it every time.

Oh, and the Riviera is still on the Strip, however, it's really far from anywhere you'd want to go, so you can't really walk anywhere.  Thankfully, we had our car, so we just drove everywhere."
cZl_Z-Ia-LYGZNWxys6-ug,4,"I remember when my parents used to love this place and I turned my nose up at it. That was as recently as about 2 years ago and now I can't get enough.  I don't think it's the restaurant that changed,  it was my appreciation for homestyle food. 

Grab a tray and some silverware and slide down the line making your selections like you did in school, only with far more and better choices.  
First are salads...garden, macaroni,  weird pea salad...all kinds of salad.
 Next in line are desserts.  Yeah it's a little weird layout.  There are several different pies including sugar free,  cakes, banana pudding, and cobblers. If they have strawberry cobbler you should get that.
 Next up are the meats. Everything rotates but you can usually expect a meatloaf, some sort of fried chicken, both fried and baked fish, and maybe some spaghetti or chicken n dumplings.  
My favorite - the side dishes. Mac and cheese, creamed corn,  carrots,  pintos, green beans, fried okra, dressing,  mashed potatoes and gravy, cabbage and probably twice that. 
Finally we have breads. I always say I'm not going to get bread because I already got so much but it calls my name. They have rolls the size of my head that glisten with butter, really good mexican cornbread,  and other assorted breads that I never choose because those I mentioned are so good. 

Highlights: strawberry cobbler, mac and cheese,  dressing, okra, and chicken with white gravy. Omg last time I had it, it was better than my momma's fried chicken."
4yLjuUhxpOoC9CgTUjosEQ,4,"What a refreshing place to go to! The first time I went here was on a Sunday and they were one of the few places open in downtown Mesa. The second time I went I didn't realize it was the same place until I got there. I love that you can convert any sandwich to an salad which is what I've done both times. I can't get enough of their roast beef salad. The dressing is light and not drowning the salad. The vegetables are slightly pickled but not too tart. Sweet potatoes are a nice addition. And I love that they give you a FREE bottle of water while you wait. Everywhere else you go nowadays, the bottled water is more expensive than the rest of the drinks."
dCZJ8YhGALt7oTyAFDRbmw,4,"After reading about Greek Brothers for quite some time I decided to give it a try and I was really impressed. Normally with 'fast' Greek places, I expect a taste similar to mall Greek food or the dreaded Mr. Greek (express). 

This was much much much better! The gyros were really juicy and the toppings were all fresh. What put this place over the top was the spicy tzatziki which was amazing and generously applied.

My one knock would be the menu is a bit confusing. I was unsure how many sides you got if you made it into a combo. Turns out its one side, I opted for fries which were good and plentiful. I'd like to have 2 sides of half portions, I didn't ask, maybe this is possible(?). This isn't enough to knock a star off. 

I'll be back here for sure!"
7-6QI-Qo4cxLOU5eWDJLHg,1,"Let me start by saying I frequent this Location multiple times a month. 
Decided to go on the bartender advice and get a margarita which I hated. 
Drank maybe 4 or 5 sips and asked the bartender for a beer as I didn't care for the margarita she made me. She dumped it and got me the beer. 
Received my Bill and was told because I drank from it I would have to pay for it. 
Asked her how I'm supposed to know if I don't like something of I don't drink from it? Bartender told me, that's just what the manager said. So I asked to speak with her. 
Before she even arrived at my table you could tell she wasn't even willing to hear what I had to say. As soon as I stated what had happened I was told by the so called ""owner/manager"" That they hate customers like me. 
And I asked her what she meant by customers like me. She stated ones who try to get free.  
I told her I used to work in restaurant and I used to bartend myself and before I could even finish what I was saying to this ""owner/manager"" she said I don't care what you do. She make you the best margarita. 
I asked her how she (owner/manager) could possibly know that as she didn't make it herself. 
Needless to say she continue to tell me that I should have told the bartender I didn't like it before I even tried it if I didn't want to pay for it. 
And again I continuously tried to tell this lady it's not that I didn't want to pay for it-- I clearly wanted to pay for it as I had ordered it because it is what I wanted-- but I did not like it and it wasn't made ""the best"" 
And it definitely was not the best margarita I've ever had it was way too sour and way way too salty. 
I suggest that you take your business elsewhere. 
They clearly have no idea what customer service is or even cares about customer service. 
Don't waste your money on folk who don't even care if their regular customers are happy. They sure as shit won't care if your once in a while pop in is happy."
lg41MCvo4gTTC91DGBcq0w,5,"I have been to the Super Summer Theater about 4-5 times and have seen such productions as ""Tom Sawyer,"" ""Noises Off,"" ""Aria,"" and my favorite musical, ""1776.""  The quality of these productions are surprisingly good, and the price (I think it's $10 in advance and $15 at the door) are more than reasonable.  It's a great value.  Plus, you can bring your own food and drink to the production- no more spending $5 for a hot dog or $7 for a beer!  I highly recommend going out to Red Rock to catch any production you have the chance to, this theater production is well worth the effort to see!"

The Burrata and Olive appetizers were both heavenly.  We also ordered the Casanova and splurged on the fruit crisp...thanks for helping up both regain the will to live, Federal!"
ImJocoyc9CJWn2gurdO48A,4,"Popped in for a little takeout after an exhaustive day of thrifting nearby. I've always seen this place and have been very tempted to try it on multiple occasions but didn't get around  to it until this evening. 

I scored myself a 3 veggie plate ( I chose fried squash, green beans and yams) with a roll, and a side of ranch for dippin' fried squash for a fiver and change. The fried squash were thin, hot and crispy. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte ( since Louis's is technically in Harrisburg) and the green beans were tasty too. I'm not well versed in yams but I like mine a touch more al dente than how they serve them up here but that's just a minor critique since they still tasted good.

The staff was super friendly. The lady that took my to go order made sure I got my food fast and even used my name when she handed me my order ( always a nice touch). The owner ( I assume) was around and was also wonderfully chatty and helpful. 

I will be back to try more.

They have a usual menu and daily plate specials. The sides available also vary depending on the day. Note: Mac n cheese is on Wednesday"

5OKtAD6Gg0tDvfctKd3i4A,2,"Food was good however there was too much salt on everything. 

This place only has pork so if you don't like pork than you wont like this place. 

They dont allow outside drinks, so if you happen to buy a boba drink next door while you're waiting for your table make sure you finish before going in. They made a huge fuss about it not sure why. 

Food is ok."
fKh88E56ceJ5quO7fZ6lxA,1,"If you want to feel welcomed don't come to this smoothie place. You are never greeted with a smile, it's cold and uninviting.  The owner is rude and and acts like they're doing the customer a favor.  
Recently I ordered a flat bread, they made it with half the ingredients off, when I complained they never apologized!"
Jv_kk64M6pjwGN6gM--6HQ,5,What a hidden gem in Henderson. The sushi chefs are always friendly and the prices are great. The sake harasu is amazing; I highly recommend it. Check it out and support your local businesses.
PwbpzY6rMh4VoWXzNwkAEw,1,"This Buffalo Wild Wings has the same great food that all of them do (assuming you're into wings) but the service is really so-so. Mostly because it look like it's waiters and waitresses are all teenagers. Which is great for the community, but bad for service. 

Our waitress was really inattentive and completely forgot that my sister had ordered a beer to go with her meal. The meal came, but no beer. Then it took several minutes to flag her down and remind her. 

Over all, not bad. But if you're going to staff your restaurant with young'ins then at least give them pointers as a group and teach them! The world is cruel, and it's hard to get a job, so train them better for the future!"
cBhl6-_wOfmf-lFVM3SNfg,2,I've used hertz a lot in the past.   However today when I showed up they were trying out a new system.   They give you a pager and you get to wait for them to buzz you.   This is really slow.   Agents would sit idle for minutes at a time while people would come from who knows where with a buzzing pager.   This caused much longer wait times.  It was silly.   A guy there who looked like a manager of some sort told me they were trying it out and he was taking notes.   It took three employees to run the paging desk none of whom were taking care of customers.   Waste of time and money.  A sign that there are major leadership issues at Hertz.
8d5IGPRvswwW_brGBRZfBQ,4,You would think finding a dependable Chinese restaurant would be easy. It's not! I used to work by here and LOVE their lunch specials. Plus they are super speedy. Yummy food and reasonable prices... Sometimes I get off at Wellesley just to pick up grub from here on the way home even if it's out of my way. Mmmmm!
JIrQRUu6Fg4uZalvTdpaSA,5,"I literally can't say enough good things about this joint! Everything I've ever tried here has been amazing. 

If you want to try Cambodian food look no further than this hidden gem. It's really hard to find and the parking lot sucks. But maybe they designed it that way--you have to work to find the BEST Cambodian food in the valley. It's worth it! 

Service can be slow at times bc they have a very small kitchen. I am telling you the food is worth the wait! 

I order the pork chop- 10/10 and the chicken fried rice, also a 10/10!"

It was not until about 10:45 am when some of the first set of customers started leaving, by which time the line up is fairly long.  First thing they ask you is which of 2 complimentary Chinese language newspapers you prefer.  The dining area is clean, and staff to customer levels are okay.  From 8:30 am to 11:30 am and also from 1:30 pm to 4:00 pm, S/M/L is $2.88.  Tea is $1.20 per person.  Food quality is good. Portion size is average.

Start with a specialty margarita, get the Zuchini Blossom appetizer, and then treat yourself to the best freaking pork loin you will ever have in your whole, blessed life.  I literally get it every time."
88Zc4m9i1Q70eLfWB9_xiQ,3,"It was good. But I feel like there were too many Asian food options- like an overwhelmingly amount, just a bit too salty for me.

After he turned the sign around there were SEVERAL people just standing there waiting to be seated... They all left"

t_Bad6jl7-0ObZddNNg-Kg,5,"I ordered cookies here from my son's elementary school. I ordered chocolate chip and an order for colored cookies for my kids (red, blue, etc.)

The only thing I didn't like was that the delivery of the cookies was only on one day for a few hours. I'm a busy mom so I missed it, of course.

I called them later, much later, and asked if I could pick up my cookies and they gave me their address so I drove over. Their location is a warehouse and the guy working in the office was super nice and helpful and told me to wait in my car and he delivered the cookies out to my car!

The cookies are so good! I was scared they wouldn't taste good for some reason, maybe it's because I'm used to Otis Spunkmeyer being everywhere, but these cookies are so tasty, so sweet, and if you bake them right, very moist. We just finished our chocolate chip and we are going to make our colorful cookies for Santa.

Thanks Cookie Dough Man!"

mrf7q9dBS9TguuYDxlCqCg,3,"We walked from our little neighbourhood to the next one to try another microbrew place, because, you know, you can never try enough microbrews!
It was a not-so-sunny-it-might-rain-not-sure-oh-here's-the-sun-oh-wait-it's-gone kinda weekday but as we arrived around 6.30 the place was nevertheless packed (inside and out). Ok, fine, it must be good then! 
As I'm freezing (no, literally) under 25degrees, we headed in and triumphatly we managed to elbow-wrestle our way to an empty table squeezed in between other tables ""Oops sorry didn't mean to leave my derriere in your food but I like didn't have a choice if I wanted to get to my seat! Looks good though!""
Beer menu is very interesting with their own brews and food menu although short is mouth-watering with good food and vegan option which as always doesn't come cheap.
We shouted our order to the waitress (see reason below) and got a blonde and a white beer, the Tempeh sandwich and the cheese board. We found nothing exciting with any of it and for the price, were still hungry.
The staff is courteous but no more. The atmosphere is really loud from the over-loud volume of the music and everyone trying to shout over it to be heard by their table companions. Plus, seriously, did you have to dim the light to ""darkness level"" at 7pm!? If you want me to pay I will need to find my hand first and eventually, I know you love me, but I will have to find the door to go home!"

The service was attentive. The food came out pretty fast which was a plus since we only scheduled one hour for this meeting. There wasn't that many people at 1:30pm, so it was quiet for us to talk. 

We all wanted meat so none of us tried the vegan menu. They looked pretty delicious on the pictures. I will come back and try them later. From the regular menu, the server recommended enchiladas and creamy poblano chicken. I went with the chicken enchiladas. One of my colleague got the shrimp enchiladas and queso with chips and salsa and the other one got the carne asada nachos. Both of us who got the enchiladas were satisfied with our entrees. Not my coworker who got the carne asada nachos. She only had few chips.  

Chicken enchiladas (4/5): I enjoyed my dish. The flavor was great. However, the chicken was a bit dry. 

Carne asada nachos (2:5): I tried a few. I didn't like the carne asada. It has a lot of fatty chewy beef. Not enough cheese either. 

Overall, I will return again due to the convenience factor, good services, and decent food."

Now, I am no ice cream addict, but I have tried these 2 flavors from the most popular ice cream shops on the West Coast, and overall I was impressed with the Honey Lavender. The herbal flavor isn't for everyone, but it's a great flavor if you want to be adventurous. Sadly the Salted Caramel was way too salty for me. It almost tasted a little smokey/burnt in my opinion. That said, I would definitely go back and try some other flavors."

BYQe5lvpPUDh8HEVdIZ6wg,4,"OK. I should probably begin this with stating an embarrassing fact: I had an anxiety disorder about getting my hair cut for about, 20 years. When I was 15, I took acid with some friends, only to find out my over-bearing mother had made an appointment to get my hair cut that same day...can you see where this is going? A few Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related episodes later...I decided to get my hair cut.
 What really irks me about a lot of Salons, is simply put - I felt like I was under a microscope from the moment I went in, to the Stylist deciding they either didn't like what I wanted and decided to improvise, or they completely disregarded what I'd specifically told them (ie. ~this~ long here..no shorter).
 Steinberg's is NOT like that at all. It's the complete opposite of most Salon's I've ever been to. The Staff are all very outgoing, professional and receptive to your needs. 
 I've only had my hair cut by Samantha - she has an outstanding sense of style and isn't above giving you feedback as to why this/that wouldn't ""work"" on you, rather than just going through the motions and doing whatever she wants, just so she can have the next client in her chair faster."
xuFPyjyRyWXxKK-Z5SQ9jg,1,"The service was great; however, the food was lacking taste, the fish and chips was the worst we ever tasted.  So disappointed that you (Robert) being from England the fish seemed to be frozen when cooked.  We spend over $100 for lunch for this tasteless food.

It's off the beaten path a little bit which to me is a plus but the place is always packed and I guarantee you will wait for a table. But guess what. It's worth it. While you wait you can go next door for a foot massage and a cocktail to get you primed for one of the best Thai meals you will have in your life. No frills and the staff is blunt and straight forward because they pump massive amounts of food out of this place everyday. Must must must have the Thai beef salad. Again. Get the Thai beef salad

Also the salt and pepper shrimp that is peel and eat. Unless you eat the shells which I do. As well as any greens sautéed up in their famous garlic sauce. 

Get in the cab and go to this restaurant."

 Not at Sullivan Motor Company!
Darren (salesman) was informative and all in all treated me with kindness, I did not feel as if I was being taken for a ""ride"".  The owner Jon, gave me a great deal on my trade-in.  Finance was quick and easy, it helps to have good credit so that way the finance person is not having to shop around for a bank who will give you a loan.  There was a couple in there complaining very, very loudly about not qualifying for a loan and the sales guy was being so nice but what he could he do, he's not responsible for paying their bills so that they can have good credit.  I seriously wanted to say to them "" Geeze, people pay your bills and leave the poor sales guy alone.

After speaking with a couple neighboring business owners, I discovered that the employees here frequently fail to show up and open the store. If they can't wake up to come in for their job, how much do you think those employees will care about the food quality, or cleanliness? I'll have to find somewhere else to get a healthy breakfast."
fqreoSwcKdMcitjQwFsxZw,2,"I ended up being very disappointed by this company.  I had heard good things about them and liked the sale representative, Mike, when he came out to my house.  He spent more than an hour measuring and talking to me about options which I was very interested in.  I was told a quote would come in about a week.  When nothing came I followed up with Mike who referred me to Ester.  Ester told me the quote was going to someone's desk for review and I would have it in a few days.  After another couple week I called again asking if they had anything for me.  I was told one of the employees had some personal issues, they were sorry and would get the quote right over to me.  After another week and a half  I called the sales person, Mike.  I told him normally I would be long gone but I really liked some of the things he said.  I told him if they were not interest in my job to just let me know and I would stop bugging them.  Mike told me that was not the case at all and that he was going to go speak with Ester and would make sure they got the quote right over to me.  That was over a week and a half ago and still nothing.  After 6-weeks I think it is time to give up on these guys.  If it is this hard to get a quote to someone who is very interested in working with them, I fear what the actual job would have gone like."
QJN_irk3aFfyER4lc2cWuA,4,"Phat Burrito doesn't look like much from the outside, just a rundown, brightly colored cinder block building. But this place has some of the best burritos in Charlotte.

These burritos are not only massive, but filled with fresh ingredients you can't get at the franchise burrito joints. There are several options of burritos, but their menu isn't that extensive. Don't go here looking for a Mexican restaurant, go here only if you want burritos or quesadillas. From black to pinto, chicken to beef to fish, & several other options, Phat Burrito provides enough of an option for the whole group to enjoy the kind of burrito each person likes. The salsa bar also has some different options to top your burrito with, & you can try as many as you wish.

This place is pretty tiny, with not much room for indoor eating. When the weather is nice, the patio is a good option & is right next to the light rail. The lunch crowd is always huge & most people take their food as takeout, so expect to wait a good while to order, & wait for seating as well if you plan to stay. The parking lot can sometimes be a hassle as well.

Phat Burrito is so much better than your normal Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. types. Phat Burrito gives you a much better tasting burrito, without a high price, & will have you going back again & again to this unique little joint."
-Q10e-YxtCCpJxW7UEIlLg,3,"The wings have a dry rub on them but there was too much oil dripping from them and it popped at the bottom.  At least, it was for me, I don't think they tried to get rid of the oil before putting on the dry rub.  I had also ordered a honey mustard dip but they didn't tell me that they were out and just gave me another dip with no explanation.

I did ask for the fries first and they were very accommodating and got it for us very quickly."
Rpnf-grme98_DoTS9itFTg,4,"Brunch is very solid here. Bottomless mimosas last until 3pm and the menu includes classic brunch items like eggs and benedicts as well as burgers and pizzas. We came on a typical Sunday and sat outside. Staff was awesome and food was very good. At our table we roared a Benedict, avocado toast, regular burger, and turkey burger. Burgers were ready and wee full  meals. Avocado toast came with just one piece of toast.  It was very good but could be made at home for sure; nothing spectacular. The Benedict was just the eggs and muffins, no potatoes as a side even, which was disappointing. Very tasty but small. The dish was great but a side is a necessity. 

All in all, the mimosa service was the best I've ever had. The glass was always full and the waiter didn't judge.  Unfortunately it was only orange juice in the mimosa, but I still enjoyed it. Wolfgangs is very solid and worth a go if you're looking for a relaxing way to do a Sunday."
a7OHsiEw38hvjzqXMubXtQ,4,"This was my first time this at Lone Star location. I think I went to another one in Mississauga but it was years ago. Anyway we were going for my daughter's birthday and with it being a Saturday night I made a reservation. We got there a couple of minutes early but our table wasn't ready. We were told it would be a few minutes and as soon as a table opened up we would be seated. But I made a reservation....doesn't that mean a table should be ""reserved"" for us???  After about a fifteen minute wait, and another party being seated ahead of us who had just walked in, we finally got seated. 

The food was good, although I found the condiments served with the fajitas a bit stingy, I had to ask for extra salsa. Our server was efficient, and friendly enough I guess. We did enjoy the free chips and salsa. I don't know if the Tex mex food is that much better than anywhere else I've eaten, but my kids really like the Mac n cheese bites.  My overall impression is that it's not somewhere I would be rushing back to."
FPz8xZCqPj1GgTjdc2Y5Yg,4,They have smoked meatloaf!!!!  Omg it's good!  Look no further for some good beef ribs   prices are right and the service is great.  Lots of space and since selection of beer and sides.  Hey where is the Lone Star?!?;
EzDu6rCdPndzqFAS7VpGqQ,5,These guys are just great! As soon as the service contract with my current pest control company expires I'm moving over to them

hvg3KeR51LRlZRObh4UP2Q,4,"Amazing meal! Jambon tapas dish was just sliced cold ham and the small piece of toast it came with it. Supplemented by the fresh bread with house made butter, it blew my mind. How could something so basic and simple be so good. Although it was the same price as a lot of decent restaurants entrees I would have chosen this over most entrees I can think of! So good I ordered some online from Portugal later that night! Langoustine was very good but a touch oily. Quail was amaZing but very small. Duck entree was good but missed that duck skin that I'm used to when ordering duck. Chocolate mousse desert was great. Other dishes we got all amazing my wife was blown away also, (she's even been to French laundry) Great service, neat sitting at bar observing the prep and staff interactions ""yes chef"" heard many times with military quick timing. Expensive meal but left full. Only negative was the sommelier who unabashedly tried to up sell us. Suggesting a comparable bottle after we picked a bottle that was 3x as much!"
ZWbHCffMoWJb5QfGOCnVPg,5,"Great spot for good Italian. We sat in the bar with the bartender, Nicole. She was a sweetheart and made great wine and entree recommendations. The Burratina appetizer is delicious. So are the pizzas. We had the Bianca - so yummy.  Great spot for neighborhood Italian."

Sat at the bar, Erica ""Jazzy"" great bartender service with a smile and so friendly!
Deep Eddies grapefruit vodka tasted like fruit infused so smooth.
Guinness on draft!!! Wow
Chili cheese fries were made with waffle fries, love the difference. Chili was great!
Just missed the ""by the slice"" specials ending at 2:30 but the bar pie's are a great price and size!
Meat Eaters pie was really good. 
Greek Pizza so good. Not too olive tasting, had flavor and wasn't dry.
Will return!!"
oDAVCLIxgEQhjzuXkTw02Q,4,"Came here to watch the Panthers game, not expecting much. After spending a few hours here on a Sunday, we were so delighted with our experience at Sycamore Brewing. 

Sycamore offers a beautiful indoor tap room, along with a huge outdoor seating area,lawn and game area. They also allow you to bring your dogs inside which for us is a total treat. Customers seem to be very conscious of their dogs behavior so it doesn't become a a nuisance.

You can order flights of beer (4 different samples) for under $10 if you aren't sure what you are looking for. I really enjoyed the bear mountain and their extra stout, but my favorite was their cider. I highly recommend the cider and am hoping to find it bottled somewhere to purchase.

Sycamore is a great place to spend the day with some friends & your pooch!"
jmVZ77NfNSKOW1yVDlMygA,5,"Such a gem! This place has character and is so quaint you just want to stay there forever. 

Service was great, and the atmosphere inside makes you go back in time. 

We had the cake of the day and tea which was perfect for sharing and catching up with a friend. 

Our new favourite place, definitely will be back!"
pr3BGZw4yMUg9vxfvqO-jg,2,"I honestly think this place is a little ""over-hyped.""

It's feels like a can of sardines in there. It's always super packed and there is not even close to being enough space to actually enjoy your meal without being constantly bumped into. Claustrophobics beware!

The sushi is good enough, but most of their rolls are drowning in cream cheese, and while I am a fan of the cheese that is creamed it can seriously get to be too much at this place.

The only other thing I have to say that was a major factor in the three star rating was the customer service. Every one working there looked like they hated working there, they hated the people they worked with, and they hated their lives in general. 

Probably will stick to Daisho Sushi since its close to our home and everyone there at least pretends to be happy."
2ugob8RIsc82gMuxN7YXNA,2,"Came here this morning because Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill is no longer serving breakfast. We decided to stop here since we love diners drive in and dives. 

Food is Ok. Nothing to write home about. Big portions but lacking some flavor all around. Bloody Mary's are too sweet and too spicy for what you ask for. Asked for spice level 2 out of 5. Thought my mouth was going to melt off. That garnishes that come with it are great. But that's about it."

Q6NkFWxT8JU_hEhzTTkBMw,2,"This was always my favorite Souvlaki place in the city. It was just ok today.  Pita was only sorta fresh and not warm as was typical.  The service was awful.  Waiting and waiting for our cutlery until my wife got up and grabbed some.  Waiting and waiting for our menus then waiting after being served to order another drink.  We were so frustrated that we walked up to the cash, paid and left."
cBc7F5FU24Prnih6eMM2MQ,5,"My floor was done in a such poor workmanship by the previous company I found on craiglist.  Gladly I found Nulook to fixed everything.  Apollo definitely provide great qulity floor job.  The guy is all about perfection once it comes to about flooring, he explain very detail about the Tile I should use and differece using Laminate and Real wood in desert area.  Apollo is definitely expert in this field and my floor came out awesome."
fXBKX5UKYNdksglf5REjoQ,1,"never again!

this place is in regression since the last owers left and that's saying a lot! the bartenders look like they hate being there, nor are they qualified to serve, and good luck trying to get some quality service. its a dark, depressing place and quite miserable considering the up beat feeling you'd normally get from a pub on a friday night.
 
inspite of any efforts the new management has put in, it has not translated into a good pub experience, thats about as nice as i can put it.....

to the current ownership, good luck, but i recommend at minimum you hire a professional bartender who can at least manage the bar properly.

at least the wings were good! that's 1 star."
3mZtR726lWbnFmZuTumy3Q,4,Had breakfast here the last two mornings and both meals were very good. First day I got the Florentine benedict and it had great flavors. I really liked the red pepper sauce and the hash browns were yummy. They had some extra herbage in them- but I couldn't quite pick it out. Hubby had the yogurt granola that was really good. The yogurt had lemon in it and the granola was super high quality. This morning I had the special which was a cheddar biscuit sliders with egg and sausage. I could only finish one and hubs had clean up duty. He was not upset by this.
W4Mc16s4Q6tUau1I8hPZAg,5,I found Alo Cafe through yelp. It is a cute little cafe with great outdoor seating off of the main road. You feel cocooned. The food was good and they served a great latte. If you're looking for a some quiet this may be the place for you!

n_Wy1AYVOWKZiRn5w6lcVg,5,"This was our first visit. We reserved a table over the weekday, good thing to do, as it was packed on weekdays which was surprising. Its always better to reserve a table prior to your visit:)

The ambience was good, we loved it:)  We ordered Guacamole, Slow smoked chicken, Tacos and a desert. They were right on time, there was NO delay in getting the food to the table, in spite the restaurant being completely packed. Food was delicious... Five stars for the taste, price and service.

We will definitely visit this place again. I strongly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed."
oDA6jHg1MNzKX5ZrZ3Lh8g,5,"My boyfriend and I come here all the time for the seafood pho and coconut water! The soup is so delicious and the location is conveniently down the street!we always come in late or close to closing, but they're still happy to serve us. There is an amazing young waiter here too, forgot his name (sorry)...but he always takes care of us and is really cordial. Yesterday instead if coconut water we got the green apple iced tea and Papaya milk tea! Both were so good! Must try if you're into those kinds of drinks :)  only sad thing is they only accept cash! Get a square reader or something for visa Amex MasterCard :)!"

Yv9VUV4yXi4JttO9mBpDpg,1,"I have come to Shady Park a decent amount of times since their grand opening with the service being relatively okay. However, this visit will surely be my last. 

After looking over the menu I decided to order a beer and a roll of sushi (let me clarify) ONE roll of sushi, and my friend decided to get some ramen. After about 10 mins go by, they bring out the ramen but no sushi. I wasn't in a huge rush so no worries - I understand it can get busy in the kitchen. Five mins go by, then ten, then 15, and finally 20. By this time my friend had completely finished his meal, I had finished my beer, and the hour of parking I paid for was 10 mins to expiring. 

Let me also add, halfway through my friend eating, they decided to ask for ID as they wanted to open up the partition between the patio and restaurant. He's only 20 but this issue shouldn't arise halfway through a paying customers meal.

My server, Sage, had came to our table several times during this wait amazed I still didn't have my food and actually checked back to the kitchen 2-3 times for me before I finally received it (she was great). But I have never in my life had to wait 30 mins for a roll of sushi. 

Upon receiving my food, the manager decides to come over to explain how ramen takes two mins to make while sushi somehow takes 30 mins (because it's an ""entree"" and somehow ramen isn't?) - all he could say was ""I understand, BUT..."". All he needed to say was, ""I apologize is there anything I can do to make it better?"" - that would have made the difference between me writing this yelp review or not.

He offered me free edamame but seeing as I had just gotten my ""entree"" and had finished my beer, I countered the offer by asking if they could refill my glass so I had something to enjoy my meal with; he begrudgingly accepted. However, when I got the bill I was charged $8 for a draft beer - even if I had gone to a club up the street I would have paid max $5.50 to $6 for the same product accompanied by better service, and better management. I paid the bill, tipped the waitress and got out of there before anything else could go wrong. All in all, this place is a JOKE. Please, if you're trying to enjoy your evening DO NOT go to this ""restaurant."""
Qy4J9KZoItb5-8d2mlSpow,3,"My buddy stayed here so I got a chance to check out the rooms and casino floor.  Yes, it's aged and they still have coin operated slot machines, but it wasn't horrible.  My buddy stayed in the main building (i.e. not the tower or cabana suites).  He mentioned the price was $40/night and they comp you $20 in food per night and $20/night in slot play.  Not too shabby!  

His room was nothing more than a typical room at a Super8.  It had two double beds and a tiny bathroom, all of which were dimly lit by energy saving bulbs.  The walls were thin and you were pretty much outside until you walked into your room.  So there were no corridors or anything.  Pretty ghetto but hey, you're here to crash after long nights of drinking and gambling.  

The El Cortez has free parking but the garage is located about 200 yards from the hotel casino.  I imagine many of the people staying there are packing lightly anyway.  

We played there on a couple nights during our stay in Vegas.  They have $3 video blackjack - you know the one with the cheap porn stars as your dealer?  :-)  They have a couple of $5 blackjack tables, and enough slot machines to keep you happy for a day or two.  You'll probably get bored of this place quickly and if you want something more upbeat, you'll have to head over to the Fremont Experience (think Golden Nugget or Binyans).

This place is aged, as is the majority of the players in the casino, but if you're looking to get away from the rowdy crowd and not spend so much at their tables, give this place a try.  It may be a little intimidating sitting down next to a 70 yr old at the blackjack table but just remember you're playing against the dealer, not him."
pFFMtVwo_bSXFQfCZq8tLA,5,We were able to secure a large section for my girlfriend's brothers birthday. The staff went above and beyond and were quick in taking our orders. The food came out quickly and the games are fun. They have a game(s) for everyone!
iM4ISaw7J8LAiNnRycQ45w,1,I booked this hotel on Hotwire. Star rating is WRONG. Rooms are very outdated. Hotel not clean. Balcony had spider webs garbages in the lobby full. Couldn't even bear the thought of staying for a relaxing weekend there is nothing relaxing about this place. I was disappointed to say the least.
s0g8UYkRMtzoPqtaMmyybw,1,"Their claim: ""We pick up your (dead) pet and treat you and your pet in a caring, humane and respectful manner"".
In actuality: The man there on 12/6/2017 did not return my phone message. I called again to verify and he yelled at me to call the county and hung up. I tried to get info or try to pay this business to handle my beloved pet companion but he kept yelling at me stating with a count of how many times I called and hung up. Now he's hiding behind his answering machine like a dirty little rat! At no point did he even offer any kind of service. All this company did was kick a guy when he was down. I will be in touch. I will be in touch."

If you like hearty breakfast foods, its a must go.  Portions are huge and prices are reasonable.  Tried their andys sage chicken benedict $20 and its big enough for 2 people. It was soooo good! We also tried their mushroom artichoke, etc hash $15 which was also good but a lot of potatoes with the benedict that was also mashed potato heavy. Had a lot of leftovers. No regrets. If you don't mind the wait.. which is common in vegas.. id say go for sure."
Mi40gqokiOMhW1410duLVA,5,"Awesome!!!! Being a fan of his television shows i was hoping Ramsey would not disappoint me and he did not. In fact my wife and i left very impressed. We had a reservation walked in a bit early and were seated in a few minutes. We were seated in the main dining room with a nice view of everything and also the open kitchen. We were nicely greeted by our waiter and they placed a very nice bread basket and butter on he table. They explained to look through the ipad to select our drinks. This was simple enough to do and it is a nice touch. For appetizers my wife ordered shrimp cocktail which was very good. It came with a sauce that was different than classic cocktail sauce but tasted just like it. I ordered the pork belly appetizer and it was insanely delicious! For main entree the wife ordered Kobe skirt steak which was delicious. I ordered the beef wellington and it was excellent. We also share the truffle mac and cheese and it was full of truffle flavor and totally outrageous! We ordered the toffee pudding desert and it is off the charts fantastic and a must try! The service was incredible and the restaurant is all first class. I love the big red leather chair i was sitting in, just super classy. Loved everything about this place and even got to take a picture with hells kitchen winner Christina who was expediting that night. Everything was ""spot on"" perfect! Great job!!"

PWp6z78J11AjYMFEF4tbtw,5,"Hallelujah!

Best burger in Toronto.  The genius is in the simplicity. 

If you want saffron scented kobe beef with garlic aoli and frise on a spelt ciabatta...... don't go here.  

If you want a real, back to basics, fresh ingredients, beautifully griddled, old school burger:  GO HERE! 
 
The comparison to In-N-Out is fair, but Burger's Priest is a small run operation that has much fresher, better ingredients, seasoning, and service.  They grind their own beef and griddle it to perfection.  When I'm in Toronto I don't crave In-N-Out, but when I'm in California I crave The Burger's Priest!

The cheese burger is heaven.  The double double is a devilish delight.  I'm dying to try The Option, but I'm so in love with the beef I have to have it.  

Be warned:  Most walk-in closets are bigger than the space they have for customers.  I have sat at one of the four stools every time I'm there, because I can't wait to put the burger in my mouth.  But maybe would be better option to take out, especially if you have more than two people.  

Also be warned:  These guys are not afraid to make it greasy = delicious."
mDR0A1-pziFUhj27J2u-EA,5,"A hidden treasure!! Talk about craft cocktails!!! incredible drinks, friendly and helpful bartender, nice low lighting, great old school juke box!

If this place were within walking distance for me, I'd be a regular. As it is, I will remember to go there whenever I want to relax and have a great cocktail!

A must check out place!! Do yourself a favor and meet some friends there for a drink, a little pool, or just chill to the music. A++++"
FFUxQ1RCQgFBhWhScVYBQQ,3,"I wish more direct (cheap!) flights flew to PIT from DCA. While the 4.5 hour drive isn't too bad, it would be much more convenient if, say Southwest, flew from DCA to PIT. Oh well......

I actually remember the old Pittsburgh airport. I've done a ton of flying out of both the old and this new(er) version and the new(er) version is a complete improvement. Still, I wish the food options were more plentiful, open later, and spread more equally throughout the concourses. Security here is relatively tame (line speaking) when compared to more heavily traveled airports. PIT is no longer a HUB so it sees much less traffic these days. It's easy to navigate, there are no insanely long walks to terminals (I'm looking at you DCA!), and it's, relatively, clean. Moving walkways are always good, I never find this airport crowded, and if you forget reading material for your flight (I'm very guilty of this), there are abundant outposts to grab media to read. I appreciate there is free drop-off parking if you're there less than an hour since I and my brother semi-frequently fly here to visit my parents and need dropped off after. I know my parents, as Pittsburgh residents, wish there were more direct flights out of PIT. Even my brother, flying home to Boston, recently had to connect from PIT to Newark (???) then to Boston-I'm not sure why they couldn't do a direct flight more than once a day (which is why he had to book connecting) for that. Staff is at least good with kids-I've flown numerous times as a minor (many, many moons ago) alone and I always had a good experience. My  parents say security is now quick, but they also fly pretty frequently and are pre-approved for TSA. Overall, I think the breadth of flights was better when Pittsburgh was still a HUB, but it (mostly) gets our divided (by distance) family to where we need to go so that's a plus still!"
QDjaKob4xgdXJm6qANs2CQ,5,Just moved to Vegas a week ago from California and desperately needed eyebrow care.  Saw all the five star reviews and decided to take a leap of faith.  I am SO happy I did!  Raji took care of me and my eyebrows have never looked better!  Fifteen stars and five thumbs up!
9UakYiLRu4P66OjXABq5_w,3,"It's average Indian, not bad.  Flavor was OK for the tikka masala and the goat curry.  Naan was very disappointing -- more like pita bread than naan. I would give the food 3-stars.  However, for what you get, it's pricey, so I knocked off one star.  I would not be going back there because I can't justify the price for what I get in return."
0go3y_aswWzXwI4ccz-RMQ,1,I have eaten at this place before and enjoyed it. I was close by so I figured I was gonna get something to go. I've sat in front for a good 10 min. The sign says please wait to be seated. A couple patrons arrived and waited for a couple minutes and decided to sit themselves. I have made eye contact with a couple waiters and they did not even make any effort to acknowledge my presence! There are several tables of customers but it didn't look hectic at all. I'm sure I can find a better Meditteranian restaurant and be treated better than this. I  never going back to this establishment.
nq4igRr8xhfPalLNFgmXoA,5,"I had a good experience getting some items fixed on my new 2012 Beetle.  I am not sure how so much can be wrong on a new car, but they are committed to fixing it which is great.  I like to work with Mike Miller.

Great service including an extra complimentary dessert to celebrate our occasional. Price was consistent with the level of quality and service.  Don't overdress -- we wore coat and tie and dress and probably the only ones in the place.  Business casual would have been fine or a sport jacket.  I'd go back, great steak!"
d0s5-fIKAd0ghZNLUpd1Zw,4,"Heard a lot of great things about this restaurant going into this meal.  I was unsure if the reviews for his restaurants were being based off of his popularity as a TV personality.  This had me a little worried.  The meal turned out to be pretty spectacular. I had the kobe rib cap and my husband had the wellington.  We share some potatoes.  The steaks are of top notch quality and executed perfectly.  The rib cap I had never come across on another menu so I wanted to give it a try.  Very interesting cut, it has the buttery  goodness of a filet but the marbling and flavor of a rib eye. Outstanding.  He also really knows how to cook potatoes.  I'm a potato snob (if there is such a thing)  he does it right.  They have a pretty solid Strawberry Martini on the menu as well. I would definitely go back if there weren't so many options in Vegas.   The one downside to my meal (husband also agreed), there is a section in the back left of the restaurant, it's almost like a little hallway. We were seated in this area.  Lets just say that the tables are very close together and I got a lot of the waiters ass is my face.  Made the experience uncomfortable."
CqFqTj8T28Rn_F_T-sVeOg,4,"Love their playful menu and concept of upscale bar food. We ordered the chicken lollipop and the fish and chips. The service was attentive and friendly. They also offer this massive 7-layer chocolate cake that the table next to us ordered for the bday celebrant. If you're looking for a lax atmosphere and in the mood for some quick fun bites, I would recommend this place."

K9sxQavEvFikgly3DPmw8Q,3,"I still like Mimi's and had a good experience there yesterday for an early lunch but just 2 quick observations about how this location is run. Half the restaurant was empty yet they still had a wait to be seated and then they did most of their seating in the loudest most closed in room of the restaurant. This is obviously a reflection on the mngt here and the lack of enough wait staff. My favorite area is the street side open window area and it seems this is the last place they seat or open up. Why? Hire some staff and improve your service Mimi's. 
 
Second: When strawberry is in the title of the dish then it should feature prominately on that or in that dish. I had the strawberry-walnut salad and it was excellent except it had a total of 3 small half strawberries on it. Really? C'mon......how does the kitchen or the wait person allow a Strawberry-walnut salad to be served with 3 half strawberries. Please re-name this dish the Search-for-the-strawberries-walnut salad."
skALTFW0Qh1VP0RPh1uauA,4,"Even though I have sworn off the Venetian after they lost our baggage and left me with a bathing suit and cover up only... long story... I do keep coming back here. Mostly, because I keep getting discounted certificates and it makes it an excellent deal. The facilities might be starting to get ready for an uplift but they are great overall. Mostly, I use the steam room and then get ready for my massage. The wait area has complimentary tea, coffee, water, and fruit. And the Ugg (i checked!!!) blankets are one of the most comfy and warm things to drape yourself with.  All my massages have been top notch.  I have never had the same person but I have never had a bad experience. The sea salt grotto with its warm seats, salt air, and mood lighting is the best way to end the treatment. 

You also have access to the fitness center and I just found out that you can take one of the fitness classes for free as well (when booked for a service) including cardio, dance, and yoga. I wish i knew that one sooner!"
QJUcghK0bzRjHv3pRQ1ZpQ,5,"This man is the real deal. His care is second to none, and that means his wife Sharron as well. Family owned and boy does it show. All I can say is thank you ! Thank you from the bottom of my family's heart, as we have all been helped by you. Keep doing the amazing things you do."
Jk1gGfwvTP771vb8X_HJLg,3,"Wasn't bad, the portions were HUGE.  I thought it tasted okay, I would come back. 
I can't say too much else, It's very typical of a sushi place."
rBcQMHHHhkzg5ZYbJee1ew,1,Well I decided to give this place another chance since I really do like the food. I ended up taking a friend thinking it would be a better experience but I was sooooo wrong. I don't know what is with the women that work there but they suck at customer service. I ended up having to ask the young man that works there to take our order after three other tables that had arrived way after we arrived had recieved their food before our order was even taken. He was great as usual but it still didn't  make up for the poor service we recieved that night. I will not be returning to that place ever again and I plan to speak to the owner if I can. So if you like bitchy women who neglect you and leave you starving & watching others eat then this is your place.
GchYXAwgd6LbCYE9KkD84Q,5,TOTALLY love this place! Katie and Jen work their asses off and they're the only two that are consistently there ALL of the time. With that said- they do an amazing job of getting to know their regulars and their specific likes and dislikes. My mom and 2 sisters go here as well and we've had nothing but great experiences. Wouldn't go anywhere else! Thanks Katie and Jen!!!
pkeBD3xdqrqmU49mYJzrNw,5,"One of the best hotels I stayed in Las Vegas for a fraction of the price and the best breakfast buffet. Well, it was like brunch every day, good thing we got the breakfast package with our room, it saved us quite a bit. The hotel is clean, the staff is well trained and prompt to help, service was perfect, we can't wait to go back."
O61VzDQSP5q8Q7eQ2zNTXA,1,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. I signed up for personal training, and went through 3 trainers in 5 months. When I asked out of my contract cause they couldn't employ people to provide the service they sold me, they said they were only able to let me out based on medical issue, or pay out half my contract. They don't live up to their end and then expect you to pay, so my advice is avoid this place like the plague. Don't sign up with them and don't sign any contracts with them. Avoid personal training mostly cause they'll bleed you dry"
gU7y7mhuT8sMpQNBb7d0-A,4,"I'm really surprised that this place doesn't have at least a 4 star rating. The food quality at Il Fornello has been very consistent as far as I know. This is also one of the most packed restaurants in Bayview Village on the weekends. I think Il Fornello is quality for value. The menu items are not expensive (when you compare to other Italian places in Toronto) and the portions are quite big. The service was also fantastic and the server kept asking us if everything was okay and was very prompt. 

For the food, we ordered: one Summer Dinner Prix Fixe which included: Salmon with Risotto and an Avocado Caesar Salad, one Pizza Salmone and one Penne Capri substituted for Spaghetti. All items were delicious and very large portions. None of the dishes were salty. I am very pleased with the food and wil ldefinitely turn when I am feeling Italian and I don't want to go down to Little Italy."
AJXMT1HfHcwdQqb9tbdH2w,1,"Beware... This place overcharged me for 6 months continuously causing me to have overdraft fees. When my one of my children cancelled they still charged me for two months after and when my second child cancelled they hounded me for several months for the last month dues. I wasn't able to catch the 6 months of duplicate over charges until after my children stopped going. They did refund partial money but it was only until I made them aware of the problem when they came to me asking for more money. This place also makes your child test over and over. This is not an option and it is an additionally $65.00 every time. The studio is a little run down, dingy and bathrooms are always dirty. If you go here please make sure you are charged correctly. They will not notify you of their mistakes unless it is in their favor. While the instruction is just ok they don't give a great deal of individual time unfortunately  because the classes are so full and only give a few seconds to each child. Office staff has been abrasive and impolite to me and my family on numerous occasions. There are several studios out there in the area to compare it with."
X4wnGQn8gR4DvXIM7DQXqw,1,"One star because I can not give 0, very unethical company, doubled the price while holding the clients stuff hostage"
PAYiEsMsr37b6mlAaoBZxA,4,We've been here a few times and it never disappoints... No nasty surprises you get what you paid for. Pricing is the same on weekends and weekdays. Typical selection of menu items. If you want something safe and usual this is the place to go.
CEE1PbEBwOsGUGyPz-X7gw,5,Sarah was a huge help.  We had an odd request and she got us through with a great price and service.  Thanks!  We will definitely be back!
J59XJW-8Xb_-qjGNn5tHMA,3,"Not much to say that hasn't been said before.  Food was good (not super great) but service was severely lacking.  They have a variety of food options, and some good pics for lunch, but nothing overly awesome.  

The one plus:  Sprecher's root beer on tap.  Worth the trip for that.  So good!"
8Vv7eFfXB92Yic53W6LkHw,4,"I'm surprised to see this place has just 3 stars. Before they opened in Newmarket I've been going to the original locations on Major Mac (Been a long time customer). Love the piri piri sauce! I usually always order the chicken filet combo or I get the family pack. Very flavourful and moist chicken. I can't say anything bad about this place. Whether it's here in Newmarket or in Maple, the service and food are pretty much the same. Definitely recommend!"
m4RG7-9ml8uG1IBYJLSJNg,3,"We took a couple friends out for dinner and they suggested seafood so we decided on the Angry Crab n BBQ. This is not typically the type of restaurant or food that we choose very often, but wanted to be adventurous. The experience was fun but messy. You choose the type of seafood you would like along with the type of sauce and level of spiciness....you can also order vegetables in the boil bag as well.  We ordered the king crab which was meaty and juicy.  I would suggest ordering the bread to sop up all of the juice inside the bag which was really delicious and flavorful. They had a decent selection of beers that were reasonably priced. Be prepared for a shockingly loud siren to go off when someone orders the spiciest sauce or is celebrating a birthday. We initially happened to be sitting right next to the siren and almost fell off of our barstools, luckily we held onto our frosty beverages and they saved us!  Would rate this a 3.5 if I could. If Cajun seafood is your thing, you will appreciate this place so check it out."
p0XsI-ymgqsNVwfI1pymxA,5,"Everything is so good. I eat the curry noodles (picture below),  egg drop and won ton soup also try the lunch special.  They do a GREAT job. 
Try it! Then stop by Kmart and go shopping lol."
z6vOdd0IBd4qqKL4AUbh6w,4,"Really liked this restaurant. Kind of an eclectic random menu which I wasn't sure how they would pull off. Was pleasantly surprised though the food was really good! Atmosphere which is always a huge component for me was great. Subdued but nice feel, full but mellow. I would definitely go back and I would order the same thing, which says a lot! Great for place for a date night spot or dinner with friends who you actually want to talk to. Not too loud."
3f_9zO96InxV6nat26P05Q,1,I made an appointment for a foot massage for my boyfriend and I on Valentine's Day. They called me today saying that they need to cancel my appointment because one of their girls are sick. And they cannot see us on Valentine's Day. Great. Now I don't get to have a relaxing Valentine's Day. They also are saying that I have to go through Groupon to cancel and Groupon is telling me that they can't help me. So how am I supposed to get my money back?!?!? So annoyed.
GcnoFjXcCeCgN-jD_5_Sug,5,"So, I've been a fan of Savers for years - been to Austin, San Jose, you name it, and have always shopped at the Elliot location in AZ, but after this last visit, this is my favorite store. 

My husband usually waits for me in the car, while I dart through the store looking for furniture so we don't have to sit on the floor anymore ;-) Last week was half off day - what an adventure - the store was packed, but we found a king bed that was perfect. Plus, I donated and recieved a 30% off coupon I could use for the bed - wahooo!

The front and back staff were so nice and accommodating even though there were millions of people there that day. They moved  it up to the front so we could come back and pay for it, and they even helped us load it into the truck. Who, by the way, are the only people who have ever offered to help us move anything from a store!

Thanks to everyone at this store for making it an enjoyable experience to find affordable stuff. We really appreciate your customer service and friendly attitude despite the craziness of sales - truly outstanding staff!"
9btOvR4GJFZoAR7R8v8Ziw,5,"We have been here a few times for happy hour and have had great service and good food each time. Ask to sit in Alexis' section. She's super friendly and attentive and has great recommendations. We are never left waiting for anything when we have her! She's always on top of making sure we have a drink and are enjoying our food. The crafted drinks are all great and are not poured weak (thank you!). The cucumber press is my favorite! We tried the Barrara which was really good, however there wasn't much on the plate to support the price. The salads are great! Try the arugula pear or harvest. Yum! My husband and I usually get a half salad and split a pizza or bruschetta which is perfectly sized. The pesto chicken and fungi (we add prosciutto to the fungi) pizzas are really good and are thin crust. The bruschetta is also good sized and delicious!

Happy hour knocks a few dollars off the prices which are clearly outlined in the menu. Outdoor seating is great and the indoor seating has lots of ambiance. This is definitely our new go-to restaurant! All of the staff are very friendly and there is always ample parking."
p_IPmILe1VVjmZPN8_7e_A,4,"Holy cow, how come we don't have one of these in Houston?  They might could give Chick-Fil-A a run for their money, lol.  Take in mind this review is based solely on my breakfast purchase of the tastiest chicken biscuit I have had to date.

The chicken is cajun and seasoned perfectly, not too spicy, perfect amount of heat.  Chicken breast was very juicy, not dry at all.  The biscuit was soft, fluffy and also had a great buttery flavor as well.  Hand in hand the cajun chicken paired perfectly with the biscuit, which I might add was hearty in size as well.  

I would SO opt for their cajun chicken biscuit over the spicy chicken biscuit from Chick-Fil-A because sometimes theirs is a hit and miss with the size of meat and heat level.

Whenever I get back to these parts, I am going to look for a Bojangles and tear up another biscuit, lol.  The fried chicken looks fantastic so I know I want to try that also.  Lucky all of you that have one of these nearby; can you airmail me one, lol"
JOaXIRTHtGI-gYbLaqkLCw,5,I love Island Flavor! They have fresh and delicious poke. The ribs were so yummy and the portion are very generous. Service is fast and courteous
9PxBQ1_gQFb-UZo0ic9Ayg,5,"Easily one of my new favorite burger joints in the QC!  Located in Stonecrest Shopping Center. I got their Avocado Club Chicken with sweet potato fries, and hallelujah!! Such a mouthwatering goodness!!! I could just taste the freshness of the ingredients and the chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection! I've also tried their smash fries (fries tossed in Rosemary, olive oil and garlic), and although they were good, I still preferred the sweet potato fries over them. Definitely coming back here for lunch!!"
FR6ICw5Gslef0DuGzhoKbg,3,"I was VERY pleasantly surprised with their Mexican food.  I ordered the combo lunch with a beef burrito and carnitas street taco with cilantro rice and black beans.  The burrito was huge and so was the taco.  Way too much food for just me, especially when you factor in the the salsa trio and Queso Fundido (a glob of cheese with charizo mixed in...YUMMY!) we ordered.  I suggest them all.  And the Chile Crusted Mahi-Mahi street tacos...I sampled them off a friend's plate & wish I had ordered them too!"
5p23c2bqNpbxmmYQNqOn2g,1,"Waited 15 minutes to be seated, and left without ever talking to anyone. Just stood at the front desk. People walked up to pay their receipt and were helped but still no one talked to me. I went to a local owned bagel shop nearby and the Frys supermarket and grabbed breakfast faster and cheaper. Awful service, will not eat at this location again"
QgaVsJGPHWyP1xWpqSE81w,5,We've been here twice and had a positive experience both times. The team here is patient and kind.  They take the time to answer questions and even provide tips/tricks that they've learned along the way. We've done both pottery and canvas.  The canvas option is different from other places as its not instructor-led but rather self-paced from written instructions and a template.  The end result is beautiful and there are many options and options for varying skill sets.  The only thing I wish is that the tables were a bit larger.  They are set up for four and that becomes crowded when doing canvas painting.  Definitely recommend this place as a fun option for all ages.
oRjrG91remHZH31JJwsGrA,5,"I took my fiance and some friends here for her birthday, and we all had an AMAZING time!

First of all, Happy Hour is great.  $6 for a bottle of Sake and a Beer.  If you like Sake Bombs, this is a terrific deal.  They have good food specials on Happy Hour too.

The service was great.  Our Teppan chef was a ton of fun, and as an added perk, he had a bottle of Sake that he routinely sprayed into our mouths.  Delicious.

The food was very good.  Like most Teppan restaurants, it's a little expensive, but in my opinion you're paying for the entertainment as well, which makes it all worth it.

The next time we're looking for Teppan, we're coming back to Kobe for sure."
rvnwpFgZk0Nn9oGftVwM9w,1,The comment from Pepboys should be disregarded. I went through their entire customer service process and was basically told the whole thing is my problem from four different layers of management which is what prompted me to write this review.
ZfnxzPjXRWpf2A_mpnRMTg,4,I don't know what to complain about. The Snow Maiden cold sake was just what I was craving. I had the Maryland roll which sticks out to me as one of the best along with a couple other rolls all were good. Great sushi in Charlotte. I'm just not a huge fan of epicenter so I would rather avoid the crowds at Nikkos instead.
3CzieR721ez7ELJ_NoPsag,4,"Scottsdale, in Native American, translates to ""Land of fake boobs and day spas."" You can find both at Hotel Valley Ho. But this review is only for the spa...

If you're looking for a expansive, over-the-top spa, complete with 4 dipping pools, 3 jacuzzis, 2 saunas, and an acre locker room, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants, clean facilities, and a great deal then you should check this out this place.

Facilties: a smallish locker room, 2 showers, 2 full-bathrooms with vanity area, a steamroom, and waiting room. With any treatment of 1 hour or more, you get full access to the fitness room. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facewash, lotions are available in the locker room, along with disposable brushes, combs, and razors. While you wait, enjoy some lemon water or Forte tea.

Services: Massages, body treatments, and facials. I opted for the 90-minute Lomi Lomi which included a body scrub and massage.

Value: Comparable to other spas in the Valley. However, they currently have a coupon on their website that gives you $25 off any 60- or 90-minute treatment. They also accept Spa Finder certificates ($100 certificates available at Costco for $80). Combine these things and you can enjoy the 90-minutes of heaven for $160, (20% tip included).

Valet parking available ($12 for overnight guests, free for visitors)."

_zVIlGZLt-Hrbj_82ilwoQ,5,Went above and beyond what I asked for. Great experience at this location. Highly recommended
gzw9a3wYwOyxIEuOSDlNtA,1,"I'll start this by saying we booked a Lanai suite with a king bed 3 months before our stay at $250/night. So here we go. 

We checked in very late due to the event we were participating in didnt allow us to get to the hotel before. We walked in and found our room was 2 double beds. I called the front desk and spoke to Diana and her excuse was ""its just a request that is why we upgraded you for free"". Um no...we had already paid for this suite there was no upgrade. She sat there and argued about what we were given ""for free"". Which was nothing because we prepaid foe the room. I finally get manager who said that he'd hold the right room for us the next night but the bed selection is only a request. So though 3 months ago we requested a king bed it didn't really mean anything. Fine. Whatever. He promises someone will bring us keys, just let the desk know when we were ready. We tried to order some food but were immediately told it would be over an hour so we went to bed starving. The next morning.... Our lanai is a view of the air conditioner vents. Our shower drain doesn't really drain and the air conditioner never really stopped. We couldn't wait to get out of the room which I'm sure was an ""emergency overfill"" room.  We stop by the front desk (9am) and let them know when the room is ready so are we. ""Ok the manager will call you at ###.#### phone number when its ready"" by 3:30 still no call. So I call again to the front desk and speak to the same lady I spoke with that morning. ""Oh, they haven't called you? That room has been ready for hours! Come down with a valid ID and pick up keys."" We finally get into the room with the lanai we wanted but its now to late to enjoy. 

Everytime we came off the elevator someone from the hotel was trying to sell us something. They wouldn't take a no and would follow us a bit trying to get us to stop after we've said no. 

The customer service was absolutely awful. They get your money and don't care about anything else."
JTUWdqcbEQcDSYUQsJ-rYg,1,"Bottom line: I did not hire them. Keep reading for entertainment value. 
I requested quotes from several businesses to clean a large sofa and 2 carpets. Spoke to Cheryl at Sir Carpet, who told me the starting prices and said a tech would come the next day to give me the exact price and then do the job. ""Damon"" (I doubt that's his real name), came in all friendly and began explaining the job. Then he got to the money. He went into infomercial mode, talking a mile a minute and telling me the base prices Cheryl gave me were wrong. A $240 job was suddenly $350. My husband told him we're not hiring him and he left. Bonus #1: He said he's the owner and boss and Cheryl is his wife. Then he told me he has a girlfriend, who is in a coma in Australia but he's texting her every day. Bonus #2: He threw trash on my driveway. Bonus #3: Cheryl called to apologize and offered to send a different tech. I asked if Damon was the owner and she said no! I said I'm not doing business with her company and hung up. I hope he's not really her husband either."
UptU_ogND3dhUkL4ZQh3dA,4,"If this was near me I'd be here all the time. 

Went for a friend's birthday and was running late. I was the last one to squeeze in at the table and normally that means you fall into this weird no-mans land of service (which you deserve for arriving after everyone else) but despite the restaurant being packed the server came to get my drink right away, grab me a chair and set me a place. 

The burger was amazing. One of the best I've ever had. Huge, juicy and delicious. The side of fries was also great. I had a crazy sundae for dessert and it was also great. 

Service was great - our server knew the menu inside and out and was very helpful and prompt, difficult when the restaurant is that busy. 

Good prices, good food, good service and a laid back casual vibe. I'll be back."
9SpsPN8MAjIvnhCGOkLTyQ,4,"OK.  As you can see, I gave Pino's a Four Star review. Also, please notice that this is a two part review.
Part One:
Last night was my first night at Pino's.  The interior is warm and inviting and a seat by the windows was great.  We got there when they just opened so there was still some prep work going on and for me that's just fine.  Ordered a Makers Mark Manhattan and I have to say that it was one of a very few that ranked as excellent!  The only problem was that the cherry was stemless and had a pit, which, for my dining companion, was a BIG surprise.  The bread and  Sundried Tomato spread was excellent.
For Starters, I had the evening special Chicken Liver Mousse which was presented on French toast rounds and accompanied by a pickled slaw with dried cherries.  It was very pleasant and a good choice.  For an Entree I chose the Braised Beef Sugo, which was a portion of numerous slices of braised beef served over linguini and covered with the braising liquid. All of the pastas were fresh and made in house. The beef was pull apart tender, but very under-salted.  There were also no salt or pepper shakers to be seen and also no ground pepper offered by the server.  I would have liked the chance to season my meal to my taste...not the chefs.
For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse with berries.  The mousse was a textural surprise for me.  Instead of light and fluffy, it was more of an ice cream consistency.  Very low on sweetness but all the same very enjoyable.

Now, Part Two:

If you're going to serve pasta dishes for $25.00 plus, You need to re-appraise your status and classification.  The restaurant tends to lean more towards upscale but at a better, affordable price point.  The interior is attractive, there are linens on the tables, the candles were very clever with the flame surrounded by coffee beans and the service was very good. 
 Things that I think should be considered are:
-New choice of cherries for bar drinks.  Hopefully w/o pits, or at least a verbal warning from the server.
-Salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  Swallow your pride.  Not every meal is going to be placed in front of someone sharing your same taste buds.
-Coffee.  The coffee was great.  Usually I take cream and sugar but I was able to drink this coffee black just like a grown-up.
-Cream.  Really?  Little plastic creamers?  Really?  You're selling noodles for $25.00 and you can't present the coffee course with a bit more panache?  Spring for some inexpensive metal creamers and perhaps present it with the sugars on a small tray with the beverage.
- The Disco Menu Board.  What is usually reserved to announce the nightly Beer, Wing and Rib Platter is used here to tell, I don't know who, about tonight's specials.  All painstakingly hand written by an employee who possesses excellent calligraphic skills.  All, of course, done in vivid day-glo colors which screams at you when the black light is turned on.
Why not try a simple frame with easy rear access to just hang a copy of the specials with a title of ...maybe...Tonight's Selections.  Keep a few spaced out on the bar for any patrons having a pre-dinner cocktail.
If you insist on keeping this Twentieth Century example of advanced technology, then why not mount one of those singing fish right above it.

I really did enjoy my experience at Pino's, but I think you reached your goal a while back but kept over doing and adding to an already spot on formula."
KrkTu7J9EpwHllK8rxk-rg,5,"First, I never take time to write reviews, but the service I received from Johnny and Jose definitely earned my business and this review.  I was at wits end with Discount Tire who after two visits could not simply get my tire balanced properly.  Reviews were not great from this Meineke but I went for a simple oil change to check them out myself.  They were so kind and welcoming I felt like their friend.  Johnny pointed out to me my struts were blown out and needed immediate attention (I already knew this, it was part of the test).  He gave me a very fair estimate and I scheduled the service.  He even worked with me on a ride while my car was in for the day.  I am so happy I have found my car care expert.  After 2 months of driving, I love my car's handling again, especially the tires that they balanced perfectly with no issue.  I cannot say enough good about Johnny as a human and the care both myself and my car received.  I do not hesitate to recommend these guys to everyone who wants to be treated with respect and receive expert vehicle care.  Thank you again and again Johnny and Jose."

eTi7RTLNbv0133k8imymaA,4,"This weekend was the first time I used Sunrise Cab and they were excellent both times!  Yes, the cars are older.  BUT!  The fares are cheaper, drivers are nice, very efficient, arrived on time, and called a minute before the pickup.  I am pleased with the experience and I will definitely use them next time!

Note: they only take cash, but they don't mind stopping at an ATM."
X7CJtOWT_Hr6PMa8HOLb_A,4,"Stoped in for what was a genuinely enjoyable lunch on the patio, near the front pools with the Gondola rides at the Venetian.

Started with deep fried pickles which were sliced into nickle sizes pieces, different from the quartered pickles that you usually would see.
Pulled pork was really good, although admittedly the one flaw was the cilantro in the coleslaw that was on top. I really don't like cilantro, but it was still a good sandwich.
Lunch with 4 beers, an app, 2 sandwiches, and aside of fries came out to just over $90 after tax and tip. Not a cheap lunch, but the atmosphere and quality of the food make it a worthy stop."

Over ten years 
Thanks ""JJ"""
8EHNnqx1VxaAeerqCUwLNg,3,"Took the family here this morning for breakfast, and we had a pleasant experience. The place was acceptably clean, busy, and the service was friendly and fast. While that was all good and fine, the reason we went there was to eat something delicious, and that was not the case. The food wan either delicious nor horrible.. My bacon and avocado omelet was super salty and had a weird taste which reminded me of a dirty grill. The country potatoes were the size of petite green peas and were a pain to eat. The pancakes were small and didn't taste like anything. The island platter was entertaining, because other than a chunk of pineapple, there was nothing island about it. Steamed white rice....not islandy or delicious at all. The Benedict was well prepared, but again nothing popped out in terms of flavor.

We really wanted this place to be way better and add it to our list of top breakfast places, but that didn't happen. There are lots more places to grab breakfast locally, and we are going to pass on this and keep looking."
7FLZJiO4JAtS0YznfjhyXQ,5,Pretty much the best in town to say the least. Honestly I love their work and their communication and follow through is impeccable. If you need wonderful photographers with high quality product and great personalities to match you have found the right place!
QJmlOpjwwDO9pmmDZQRWdg,3,"This is a review of the Gold Coast's coffee shop steak special.  You see it touted on some websites as one of the best in Las Vegas deals.  I think it is a decent belly stuffer but not a great deal for most people.  It is probably very popular because they keep A-1 steak sauce on the table unlike most places where you have to ask for it.

This is the $10.95 16 oz. T-bone.  The salad is decent size and they put a lot of blue cheese dressing on the salad which included olives, a few slices of cucumbers and tomato.  The quality of the blue cheese dressing was pretty good with visible chunks of blue cheese.

The steak was accompanied by 3 potato halves, 2 onion rings, 1 halved Texas Toast, a miller or bud (I forgot which one) baked beans and a lettuce garnish.

Baked beans were okay--probably Heinz out of a can.  The 2 onion rings were more like garnish than a true side but actually pretty good-- one of the better onion rings.  The potatoes tasted like they were lightly fried with a crispy top but they could have been baked.  There was a slight fishy flavor but under the crust they tasted okay.

The big disappointment was the steak. It is fairly thin, about 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick which means that it is difficult to get a medium rare type of consistency through it all.  Also, it had a fair amount of gristle.  

I remember the last time I ate there I was pleasantly surprised by the value for the meal.  However, I've read that because steak prices have been going up that places are substituting Choice for Prime and even Select for Choice.  I think that Gold Coast may have done that here.

You still get enough to eat because the toast is thick, the salad large and you have baked beans but they are all fillers.  The star of a steak dinner is the steak and I think it is worse than I remember.  If you want to fill up this is still a great deal.  If you have eaten here before when it was better, you may want to reconsider."
gAzJqK5zBKLpF-8wpeK5CA,4,"Hmmmmm, it seems this Restuarant is listed twice on Yelp.  But, this is the location that pops up on my Yelp app when I pull up nearby restaurants so I should review it too. 

The food is excellent. I highly recommend it. A little pricey, but the quality is there.  It gets really packed around lunch time and only seats about 15 people so you may have to gets yours to go, but trust me, it's worth it!  Dare I say it's one of the best sushi joints in Toronto? (in my humble opinion...)

Check them out!!!

Here's a link to my other review about them as well:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mt-fuji-restaurant-toronto#hrid:QlhQDH3uwzr1SV8kJDDlOw"
jdsBUlvUhi85FK67HsXmLg,5,"I come here often, about 3/4 times a week. The service is fast, friendly and they get it right. I am a Dunkin donuts fan, as I grew up with it back east. Favorite location hands down. Give it a go!"
-slI8-4GRbTVr8s9xVqwHg,1,This place sucked. I think you'd have to be wasted to choke this stuff down. Most patrons probably are wasted.
JRHcPGKuSYDDYNZDkwOAEA,1,The worst service! Mail boxes are broken for more then two months just to go to this post office and stand in line for more then a hour to pick up your mail! THERE has to be someone to fix broken mailboxes ASAP SO THERE IS NOT THIS MUCH INCONVENIENCE! Beyond rediclous!!!!
Rrxegz-oba04UsVggq7tQQ,1,"Overpriced hipster joint, food is nothing special. Nice location. The wings have a mustard like sauce. The ""service manager"" contacted me via yelp and straight up lied to me in a very bold, strategic manner. A whole different level of scumbag. Very disappointed."
MHdlWX3vBw13zT0JszKaCw,4,"Honestly, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews for this place, but it seems that all the newer (2013 start and forward) have been positive, and we have good things to say about it too!  The pork fried rice is amazing and the pot stickers are a new fave also.  I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  

The cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  

Other bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!

Overall: A
We highly recommend the pot stickers and fried rice with any of the meat additions (chicken, pork, beef, etc.)"
HdkHjj0SCEZamly5qdMFJA,3,"Hey everybody, sorry it's taken me so long to review this Panda Express but what can I say - I've been busy lately. If you're not familiar with Panda Express then let me give you the low-down and fill you in on the scoop:

Panda Express is a chain and I personally know that they have locations from Philly to Phoenix because I have been to them first hand and definitely know what I am talking about, but this review is for one SPECIFIC location so listen up. This place has Chinese food, and basically everyone who works there is Chinese I think, so by definition that's pretty authentic. The food quality here has a pretty big range, depending on when you show up. If it's a busy time and lots of people are ordering then it's pretty fresh and delicious, and there's a lot to choose from. If you come at an off-time, then expect that the food has been sitting under their little heat lamp glass armor fort thing for a while, and might not be up to your high standards, but if that's the case I guess you're the one who screwed up because I already warned you about that in my review, you big dungus!

The atmosphere here is actually pretty nice for a fast food joint. It's on the corner of a shopping center and there's lots of windows and good seating so if you're going to hang out, you can just look out the window at the people walking by, and there's a McDonalds just outside and you can make faces at the people in the drive thru.

As for the service, it's pretty average. The people are nice, and they let you sample things if you want, but nobody's ever been particularly excited to serve me Chinese food there, which I guess makes sense because I wouldn't be excited to do that either."
FpGF4OFDRVIRkKhAafq1MA,3,"Menu has changed, food OK, no kid balloons. floors slippery when wet, servers did a very cute dance."
7md7mmUuk-CFCXd2tc883w,5,I love coming to Gilbert and the Civic Center is no exception. Everyone from the mayor to the people at the Information desk is exceedingly friendly and helpful. It's a beautiful town and kept up very well.
xdE36s0EuV3tnUCUZ9JR3A,5,Great experience. Food looks and tastes great! Lovely staff. Just moved near and will be back again. Loved the black rice sushi.
ldiBMBoWDGNNZnqRSIX-hA,4,"Another Guu-like experience with Japanese Tapas.

Booking at 3 person reservation still meant sitting at the bar, but like many reviews noted, this is not a bad thing because 1) you get to see the food prepared and 2) purse hooks and 3) amazing lighting for food pics. 

What we ordered:

Bamboo - cocktail off the main menu with melon liqueur and 1.5 oz alcohol. Delicious and light, but not much in terms of booze.
Chicken Karaage - fried chicken is always a keeper - juicy inside, crispy outside
Beef udon - we needed some carbs too - was ok, but not the highlight
Salmon and 7 friends - beautifully displayed, server mixes up the dish and eat with seaweed. Delicious and salmon was so fresh.
Black cod sushi - beautifully served, and yummy. Love the big portions
Grilled black cod - this came last and was sizzling off the plate. Sweet and delicate, HIGHLIGHT!
Scallop sashimi - off the daily menu. Super duper fresh, came with wasabi and soy sauce.
Baked brie - crispy and melty brie. Was a lot less interesting after it cooled down, though...so eat quickly.

Food, as always, was amazing. I'm just not a fan of the noise level - it was migraine level at some point and couldn't have a conversation with my friends. One of us was always shouting: ""...wait, WHAT??""

But will definitely come back!"
ZO2vKZscieFGQrHYxyWanw,4,"Had breakfast here with my honey on the way to the airport to go back home to Cali. 

The restaurant was very clean and the decor was contemporary.

We were immediately seated and given menus and a glass of water. I immediately noticed the menu consisted of a fusion of french and southern foods. 

I ordered an egg white omelet, it came with potatoes, and toast. I also had a mimosa. 

My husband ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a salad. He also ordered a bloody mary. 

We also ordered beignets (we couldn't resist) which came with raspberry sauce, nutella, and a vanilla bean sauce. 

The food as GREAT and cheap! The raspberry sauce was good enough to write home and tell mom. 

The beignets was not as good as the ones you get from the famous Cafe du Mond in New Orleans but they were very tasty. 

I wish we would have discovered this place sooner."
8ONvq4EcYPliUEuSdJ4Fbg,4,"Kind of small, but I've had excellent luck with produce here: fresh and organic. In-store coffee bar is a nice plus."
WejtsMNDCeg8KHldTXaeaw,5,"When I was 18 years old I started my own carpet cleaning company, that was way back in 1986, I even went to school to learn how to clean carpets. What I hate about many carpet cleaning companies is they will try to bait you in with a cheap price and then try to change that price so many times for extra things which is all nonsense and simply a bait and switch tactic,  I really hate these people who do this and so many of them do it. I can be really hard sometimes to find a company who doesn't. These guys Keystone Carpet Care, LLC on North Green Valley Pkwy in Henderson are the best you can get. They came out with a Truck Mount and before you knew it they were done, and did a fantastic job, no sales pitch, no changing of the price, just super fast, super efficient, very professional and did a real professional job. There is no substitute for a Truck Mount machine, I ran my business with portable units, and although a good job can be achieved, there is no substitute for a truck mount with two guys who know how to use it. If you want your carpets done right and you want it done quickly so you can get on with your day, you will be happy with this company. I had Luis come out and believe me these guys know what they're doing. I will be recommending them to others and using them myself in the near future. I've tried cleaning my own carpets with one of these personal Hoover type machines you get on Amazon or Target, but they cannot compare to this type of professional cleaning, their Truck Mount has got real power in terms of water heat, water pressure, and suction, it's worth it to me to just call them up and have them come out and get it clean for me in a fraction of the time it takes me to do it. I'm really happy with the service and very glad I found a company who obviously knows what they're doing. Happy New Years!"
n9oHRtA2xqC-lO7wb3MMfA,5,"I live in Las Vegas so I go to Mt. Charleston a lot in the summer since it is 20 degrees cooler, and in the winter you have snow that you can enjoy and get back home in a jiffy!  I stayed at the resort and I had a fantastic time, I got the coupon in my Valpak coupons! It was so fun, we arrived got settled in, we had a small balcony just right for the two of us! The rooms are kinda cabin theme, if you want luxury there is plenty of that on the strip.  We then went on a small walk with the snow settled on the ground, it was refreshing and beautiful! We returned ha dinner and had a drink at the lounge, what a nice atmosphere. This is a great getaway, for us on a budget ... so close and so different from the desert! Love it!"
lRd6FoRyogZEW_YLQpEbPA,3,"Came here for breakfast with a friend and we sat out on the patio. I loved the patio it was a great atmosphere for a meal. 
Our server was super friendly and helped me out when I was looking to get a half caff latte but they had to improvise as they were out of some ingredients. The coffee was perfect when I got it. 
I got the kind of catch all breakfast, two fried eggs, black beans, grits and toast. 
The eggs were cooked way more than I had wanted but were decent. The grits were totally flavorless. The black beans were my favorite, they were good. 
Overall I found the breakfast to be very bland but would be interested in trying something else on the menu. I saw some people eating hash type breakfasts that looked delicious."
RFvBGqfB1DmHYDtm5L3d9g,2,"My boyfriend and I were really excited to try Honey Salt, but ended up being very disappointed with our experience. Flat out, our food was too salty to enjoy, way too salty. We were nearly dehydrated after the meal due to the amount of salt we consumed.  The concept is okay... an upscale, local, hipster joint, but the food was just not up to par with the prices...$84 for two people and no alcohol. No thanks. 

We will not be going back."

rBO2XCxV5zX1FlqBURd_SA,5,"4.5 stars! One of our recent attempts at replacing Mint Thai...

Service was good, totally friendly, small/quaint atmosphere. Prices seemed normal, nothing outrageous.

Food was tasty! And if ""thai hot"" isn't hot enough, they'll bring out thai chilies, some sort of crazy thai powder, and a paste. Definitely kicks it up a notch to the desired level.

So many choices, we have to go back!"
J9U6Z1zV2vCau09lVQAUfg,5,"My sister in law had just given birth and I called for a burger and the grill was closed, but they made a burger special just for her !!!! Best burgers on Roncesvales ! A little pricy but definitely worth it  staff is great. Just had their special grass fed beef chuck burger with cheese bacon, sautéed onions, tomatoes and thousand island dressing... DAMN GOOD"
YgCG1t7FPARtwTIEKHSgHg,5,Had another great dining experience at Alexi's last night.  It was very busy but we were waited on immediately as if the place were empty.  The food was delicious.  They serve chocolate cake that is to die for!  Hope to see you there soon...:)
hmf1pwI57cCpHPczYNcMVQ,4,"After an hour of driving around looking for somewhere to eat the bf and I ended up landing back on the couch and ordering from Cheers through ubereats (sorry eat24).

We ordered at around 11pm and got our food at 11:30pm. Super hot and fresh. So much food per item. The bf got his usual cheeseburger with bacon and onion rings. We also got the loaded tator tots and the mac and cheese bites. We had so many leftovers and we pigged out. 

I cant speak for the location itself except that I know its in the corner of a blah shopping plaza. I would very much recommend their food regardless of location."
qmO_W4SXvfirtMSXWx9Fgg,5,"I happened to be in the area and needed several sub's for an event. I googled ""Best sub sandwiches Pittsburgh "".  Bethyl Deli was listed as number 1.

XEfxF2xQydaDnI-qXIw78w,5,"Definitely great food doubt. I was skeptical, place wasn't open long and great reviews.  I asked why when I went in & was told a lot of loyal customers from old location.  Well its always buzzing and well worth it!"
JlsjSFjHRtLdONTWe9-DvA,5,Amazing Pho and apps! Loved the bloody Mary's and the tea and curry!!! Great ambience with plants and fantastic server!
xNDCgnCIRk19mRI1JNf8_g,4,"First off. Who is the duke of this place.  I have 17 check ins and I'm still only 6th in check ins here. Someone must be living here and checking in everyday.  

Anyways. This is an update after coming here on the regular at least twice a week.  The food here has been consistently good and just great bang for your buck.  Cheap and delicious. Where else can you get a set dinner 3 course meal.  For about 11-12 bucks out the door?  Comes with a drink too.   A bonus is one time I forgot my iphone and they kept it for me.  When I went to pick it up they even verified I was the right person by telling me to call the phone before returning it.  Quite honest owner.  

Tip: sometimes you have to ask for dessert.  They seem to give it randomly."
bkl1_WRTtwUynwie1lIscQ,5,"I am from out of town and went there for dinner last night and it was amazing! I went there with family and ended up trying a bite of everyone's dish and was pleasantly surprised that everything I tasted was fantastic! My dish was the steak salad and it was delicious! I love the ambiance, the food was spectacular and the waitress, Erin, was absolutely the best! I would eat here every night!!! I would highly recommend stopping in here."
UN6IQwLyTYJvSY2LC0jbfw,5,"We had a coupon to go here, so we thought we'd try it.  We're so glad we did...this is going to become a regular place for our family to visit.  Great selection of food on their menu and their from their specials.  Kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesdays, too!  The food was excellent, and the prices are great!!  Beef tips on rice with 2 sides and a roll was $7.95!!  The staff was also very friendly...our server was great and very attentive.  We will definitely frequent Phat Daddy's for lunch and dinner...and I can't wait to try breakfast, too."

NtF-kAldqUObVw4C2R2KKA,2,Tried it three times because I really wanted to like it. The food is very mediocre and the prices are really high for what you get. The po boy basically has no sauce or much flavor and is a basic sandwich for $14. Deli st has better food for half the cost. Disappointed and will not be back.
aRobWjt2aya5NoGtwv1c7g,4,"Ahh Havana Café and your wonderful Mojito's...
I have been several time, but have not reviewed, went last night and had the tapa's - Bacalaitos Frittos, Maduros, & Croquetas de Jamon.  The Bacalaitos were delish, nice crispy texture and not even the least bid fishy, people should give these a shot.  The Maduros were perfect - very sweet with just a touch of crispness.  The Croquetas were just alright, I think they need a spicy sauce or I should have added something spicy to the sauce.  The mojito was perfect, I don't think you will find a better one anywhere.  
Service - the waitress was very flustered by another customer, I think this made her forget about me, I was on the patio and alone and nobody checked on me for at least 15 minutes.  Drinks and food were very prompt after I ordered, but I would have had more if I had been checked on.  
They also did not give me happy hour pricing, but I emailed the next day and this was fixed promptly, if you go during Happy Hour at this location, just remind them.  I am sure they will fix your bill.
Overall great experience."
xmgsOU6rPQ1v0YMjkkl9dg,1,"I recently visited the Olive Garden location in Peoria. I have to say that this was the absolute worst visit I have EVER had in all of my years dining with this company. My mother and I exchanged our soups do salad as we have done in the past never thinking it was a problem, well we were most definitely wrong! When the server by the name of Adam came back to our table and instead of asking if we would like refills on our drinks, which we needed, he proceeded to pretty much scold us about switching soup and salad plates. He said to us and I quote ""JUST SO you know by switching plates I have to charge you, I knew it was going to happen it happens all the time I normally let it slide while at the table but JUST SO you know if you take any home or ask for refills I will have to charge you"" and it wasn't said in a quite voice either it was said loud enough so that other patrons could hear what was being said. I have never felt so humiliated while dining out ever!! There are ways to word things and get the point across in a polite and professional manner the way he handled the situation was completely uncalled for and very disrespectful. We were so embarrassed by the situation that we didn't even finish eating the soup or salad and requested boxes to box our barely touched dinners. We allowed him to box our dinner to ensure that he knew we weren't going to ""steal"" the remaining soup or salad. This experience has left such a sour taste in my mouth that I will never visit this particular location!! If I could give this location 0 stars for the service I would!"
coxzVQl_vEIURtgvjpe9uw,3,"Solid food in a very casual atmosphere, food is tasty and nice sized portions, I didn't like the fact they serve you in styrofoam cups from the hot tea to the Thai iced tea. I had the fried chicken on rice, fresh crispy and enough salt and sauce to appreciate the taste. My wife had the On Choy (Thai style), came sizzling on a hot plate, real fresh and cheap $6.95, in fact the food here is really affordable, not a date restaurant, great for families or casual meal. Would come again."
9V24vXerDg3I51k--_IySA,5,"Cake is GORGEOUS! Not like your typical scottsdale club. You walk into a pure seductive scene of beautiful decor, amazing music and the lighting is next level! They have arielists that dance over the tables, last week they had a stilt walker! The cocktail waitresses have the cutest outfits and are all super sweet too which is a plus! So cool and so different! def have to check it out ASAP!"
8cSIhqLw3nRwoTVhUdy3SA,4,Funny and entertaining show. Had center mezzanine seats we paid full price for and wish I had read the reviews earlier. Even booking as a Total Rewards member through Rio website gives you no discounts and later found could get 40% off mezzanine seats through Travel Zoo. That said you will enjoy the show and suggest floor level seats as view is much better there.
SHTR1m9N0oLic9ioVPWX0g,3,"I read and use these reviews all the time.  I felt that it was necessary to let ladies know that  this is a great place to go to make your kitty pretty.  Lets face it, this is not the most pleasant thing to get done.  But, the ladies that work here are great.  They try to make you feel comfortable and try to relax you as much as possible.  I'm always pleased with the end result.  I've had a bad experience with an ""upscale spa""  here in Henderson where they applied the wax that you peel off and it was horrible!  I've had a bikini wax and the Braziillian wax and I'm completely sold on the Brazillian (at least for summer and vacations)."
6lfcP7oTdxrzuV0Q6h2-2Q,4,"Lobby/Check In:

The Radisson in my mind is a little bit older and grungy at times. Basically, a chain of hotels that meets basic needs. However, this Radisson far surpassed my expectations. 

The lobby is clean and modern and extremely comfortable chairs dot corners and walls. High ceilings give the entrance a bright airy look.

Check-in was a pleasure. It is a two-person counter which means at a busier time slot, be prepared to wait a bit, however, I was fortunate to have checked-in at 5pm and it was a breeze. We were asked if parking was necessary, given hotel keys (two sets), explained where the main restaurant was located (The Watermark), a 25% gift certificate for dinner at The Watermark, and were provided the password for free Wi-Fi access. 

Room Number 712. 

There are 8 floors in total. We stayed on the 7th floor, and again, the room far surpassed my expectations. First impressions: clean smell (unlike some hotels where you can smell that bathroomy-curtain-shower-mildewy smell...), modern (signature dark woods), comfortable (lounge chair in the corner) and surprisingly large for a city-view room. 

What makes this room feel even more comfortable are the two large windows on either side of the wall providing lots of light to flood in. A working table and a television provide all the basic amenities one can ask for. As a FYI, there is no mini-bar but a fridge where you can put drinks and food in. A coffee machine is provided with coffee and tea and two cups (all clean).

Bathroom was very clean. Signature amenity kit provided with products of no particular brand. Hairdryer is attached to the wall (not a standalone). One nice feature was the shower curtain where they had a big see-through mesh strip (near the top of the curtain) so you can look out. I thought this was a nice touch so that it is not too dark when you are showering (sometimes thick curtains can be a tad claustrophobic). 

Bed was very comfortable with lots of different size pillows to cater to everyone's taste. 

Noise-Level.

I think this should be a category on its own when reviewing rooms - nothing can be worse than hearing annoying things or sounds (especially when you are trying to sleep!)

The hotel is very close to Queens Quay main street so if you book a city view room, be prepared to hear the street cars rumbling by. I have to say however that this was not a major problem for me. I am very noise sensitive and something as inconsequential as a car driving by can have me stay up for hours on end. But the street cars were not a concern.

The air-conditioning/heating vent was not noisy so crank the temperature up or down and you will not be bothered.

Be prepared to hear doors banging and occasional noises from the hallways. This was the one thing that I noticed during my stay. It could just be the room I stayed at, so this would be the only negative aspect.


Extras.

There is a roof-top pool that would be awesome during the summer months, sizeable but not long enough to do serious lap swimming.

Direct access to Shoeless Joe's Restaurant.

There is baggage storage for you to leave your bags - no charge.

Conclusion.

I would highly recommend The Radisson Queens Quay location as it ticks all the boxes of basic meets. The rate I stayed at was at a discount of $149/night excluding taxes and additional room-charges (as of September 4th, 2011), however, the regular rate was $189/night (as of September 4th, 2011). Still, for that price and for its unbeatable location of right being at the waterfront and Queens Quay, this hotel has HUGE value. Closest subway station is Union so this hotel is very close to all the major downtown hotspots if not for its close proximity to the subway and streetcar.

There is a small gift shop at the corner of the lobby, however for longer stays, there is a Shoppers Drug Mart and Rabba's Food Store directly across the street where you can purchase snacks and water. I would recommend this option so you don't have to pay hotel prices and you can just put the items in the fairly large fridge.

A definite stay for next time.

Hotel Rewards Program.

The Radisson chain is part of the Club Carlson Rewards Program which includes Country Inns & Suites, Park Inn by Radisson, and Park Plaza. Please visit the following link for further information on the rewards program. Although a frequent traveller, I am not a member of this program, but for those who frequent any of the above hotels, I think it would be worth a look.

KWZRNeA78LhCmMgjzZKwyw,3,"A solid 3.5 but I can't believe YELP seriously waited for one of us to put the place on the Map. 

I've been meaning to write a review just so I can check in. Oh well~ 
This place is the ""Bees Knees"" in my fam. 
I'm not a breakfast person so I appreciate brunch or any place that serves breakfast alongside every other possible and feasible option so I'm not stuck eating what everyone else wants but I can't fathom. 

ABOUT BSBC - it works to have something of this standard on campus. It really matters. I forget to go to the Hotel restaurants sometimes but this place stands out like the old school ""Diner"" photo that everyone tries to replicate on tv and in the movies. Anywhoo~ the large glass windows are akin to Graze on the Cap Square. 

The location is at the right crossroad of campus and downtown. 
Not to far so we can walk but close enough to the events if you've got tickets to something. 

I hope this place last so I can show my mom and really give a review."
B3FYZWqMSuG-JWZjI7ZGTg,5,"Searched yelp all the reviews for the best of steak & lobster and we selected The Capital Grille and was not disappointed.  It was our anniversary and my husband's 65th B-Day and was pleasantly surprised with complementry champagne.  We had the prosciutto wrapped  mozzarella, filet  mignonette Oscar, 2 lb lobster tail de -shelled, and the sautéed spinach.  The spinach was a little blain but everything else was fantastic.  For desert my husband had the cream brûlée and I had the flourless chocolate cake both excellent.  The service was fantastic a call out to our waiter Jason Sherry for a wonderful dinning experience."
cRkGG6m-RCZRRGCw6u2GeQ,5,I just recently started to bring my dog here and I could not have made a better choice. The employees are one of a kind and have a genuine interest in each dog that comes through the door. Not only is my dog getting the socialization that he needs but I don't have to worry about him being home alone all day. I know that when I drop him off in the morning he is in good hands.
LIxp9BioVyF2QaZZRv9buA,4,"My wife and I usually go out to eat on Sundays when Buon Gusto is closed so we made a point to go there Saturday and finally try it. The service is great, a very friendly staff that make you feel at home. My wife ordered the Broccoli Penne and I ordered the Buon Gusto. My wife's Broccoli Penne was great no complaints, the Buon gusto however was just a little better than average which was kind of surprising since its named after the place. For desert we tried the bread pudding which is 6 out of 5 stars. I would give this place 4.5 out of 5 stars but thats not an option so well go with 5."
VkxO4DZF1MPeqvgtVZI51g,5,"The food, price, customer service and ambiance was really nice. We have no complaints for a quiet dinner on a Friday evening. The magazines and the decorations of the Cafe sets a relaxing mood. The pasta&lasagna was freshly made. But for my personal preference I would suggest to lighten up on the spices for the pasta. The chai latte nicely decorated too with a heart shape on the foam. 

We look forward to our next visit here again"

BPRlCZ-Z_yRwWNe69V3zdA,3,"Why did I rate Joe's Crab Shack 3 stars when I rated In-N-Out Burger 4 stars in my last review? Interesting since Joe's Crab Shack is a casual dining restaurant that I get to visit once in awhile as a treat whereas In-N-Out Burger is a fast food establishment that I would normally dine in. The answer is employee enthusiasm. When I spend $6 in In-N-Out, the employees greet me with enthusiasm. However, when I spent $23 in Joe's Crab Shack you could kind of say the waitress was like a crab. The waitress wasn't nasty or bad at her job. She gave me the impression that she didn't want to be there. When I write reviews, I push on customer service and cheerful employees. Attitude could make or break my ratings.

  The fact that I was disappointed in the waitress's friendliness shouldn't have been. When I originally set foot in a Joe's Crab Shack in Orlando, Florida the restaurant was overflowing with a good times vibe. All the employees were friendly and at the top of the hour they'd dance. Enjoying an upbeat atmosphere over tasty seafood was my kind of scene. Joe's Crab Shack had a name for good times and seafood. It was a name that would draw me into a Joe's Crab Shack on vacation. When I moved to Las Vegas, the Henderson location lived up to the name. But in life things happened and Joe's Crab Shack disappeared from my life. On Sunday, when my brother and I were hanging out in Barnes & Noble, I was like, ""Joe's Crab Shack is a block away on Rainbow. Let's try it.""

  When we stepped foot in the restaurant,  which also sells gifts by the way; it was sparsely populated for a Sunday late afternoon. The hostess was friendly. If the waitress had had the hostess' s attitude this review would of taken a different tone.

  I ordered the Big Shrimp combo. The dish featured coconut shrimp, fried shrimp, and stuffed crab shrimp with fries and cole slaw. Over the years the menu must of changed. It wouldn't be surprising since the personality of Joe's Crab Shack had. Kind of like the waitress' s attitude, the Big Shrimp combo leaves me unenthusiastic. Why? Two of the three types of shrimp were breaded. Breaded shrimp reminds me of Mrs. Paul's. And I could just walk into aisle 2 of Walmart to pick it up. Now the stuffed crab shrimp was delicious. The thing is it was tiny in proportion to the breaded shrimps and fries. In my honest opinion, Joe's Crab Shack would have been smart to follow Red Lobster's example of giving a choice of shrimps and less breaded shrimp. For the record, the fries and cole slaw was delicious. When all is said and done, the Big Shrimp Combo with a Coke and tip wasn't worth $23. 

   Dining out is precious. I work hard for my money and deserve to eat in a restaurant where the waitress wants to be. In reality, it will be at least 6 months until I patronize this location. Red Lobster, Bubba Gump, and lets face it In-N-Out Burger are better choices."
vPAh0oQMjuHZNozpb5OuKg,4,"L.A. people are so spoiled with wonderful sushi restaurants at nearly every corner - I'm one of those people. But I have to say that Roka Akor has blown most of the L.A. sushi restaurants I've been to out of the water. I don't always rate the restaurants I eat at for various reasons, but I couldn't wait to rate this restaurant. You'll see why...read on please.

Roka Akor is rated as one of the Top 10 sushi restaurants in the U.S. by Bon Appetit, so with that rating plus being from L.A., we were definitely expecting a lot. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly at the best seat at the sushi bar, and given our menus. We took a gander, and were kind of shocked at the minimal selection of rolls on their menu. (Of course this didn't matter later once we tasted their food - everything is excellent. Don't let this disappoint you, it's excellent food.) A few minutes later, I noticed another couple seated a few seats away from us. Their waitress attended to them right away, and we still hadn't been attended to at that point, so I was immediately pissed off and ready to walk out of the restaurant. My friends who know me well, know that this action would have been true to form. I'm nice, but I'm accustomed to excellent service at all types of establishments. When I don't get it, I get pissed off - that's just who I am and I don't think I'm the only one.

I digress...

I'm glad my husband kept me seated to give the waiter a chance to come over and take our order because I ended up really enjoying myself...and the food obviously. We had a sampler of Shochu drinks, which are these delicious infused drinks. Our favorite was the Fuji Apple flavor, although all of them were good. At the same time we were served our appetizer - the Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus yuzu. (Incidentally, the Fuji Apple Shochu really brought out the flavors of the Butterfish Tataki.) Usually butterfish has a muddled flavor - I think that's just the nature of that fish, but their preparation of this fish really cleaned it up. It exploded with flavor - very delicious.

We also ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chili Maki. This roll has very clean flavors - I enjoyed it very much. Next came the Roka Sushi selection, which are 4 different types of sushi selected by the chef. My only qualm here is that one of the four nigiri given was something we also had a full order of (the Salmon Goma Nigiri). Nonetheless, all of it was good. After that came the full order of Salmon Goma nigiri we ordered, which was sooooooo SO good. My husband usually doesn't like salmon because he thinks it's too fishy, while I ordinarily love salmon. We both loved loved loved this. It was so excellent. I would definitely order it again. Finally, we received the kobe beef, which was also very good. Perfectly cooked medium rare and lots of flavor. It comes with mushrooms which added a great dynamic flavor to the meat, and this yummy creamy sauce in which to dip the meat. Delicious. For dessert, we had the Green Tea Custard. We ordered this mostly out of curiosity. Who's ever heard of a Green Tea flavored custard? It did not disappoint. Light & airy, this custard really impressed us. I only wish I had the black cod because it looked so yummy and other yelpers have raved about it, but oh well. Maybe next time.

After the meal, our server apologized for the delay we experienced earlier in the evening. I really appreciated and respected that. It was definitely a good move on his part, and he got a good tip out of it. Later, though, I thought that if they were really sorry they could have comp'd part of our meal. So here's how I came up with the score:

5 for the food, knowledgeable wait staff and nice ambiance
minus 2 for the huge f*ck up early in the evening
plus 2 for the apology
minus 1 for not comping part of our meal
= 4 (if we could rate in half points, I'd probably give them 3 1/2)

Final thought: I don't know why we didn't get approached by the wait staff as quickly as the other couple who was seated after us, but I don't believe that people should keep quiet about stuff like that. When you pay for anything at any amount, you should be given the best service possible and if not, the establishments should expect to deal with the consequences for their actions. So, keep it up Yelpers! Use your consumer power!!"

It has been nine months that my vehicle has been in operable and I have yet to get a return response from someone at this company.

Pretty slow.... 

Food: 
I ordered:
- 1 Veggie Gluten free-pizza, ($16)
pizza was ok, pretty large

- side of potatoes ($6) expensive and not really tasty. they don't have fries! 

- Strawberry Lime Mojito: pretty good and strong.

- fountain drink ( ginger ale) : no taste , too watery.

They have a huge menu selection , (a bit pricey ) almost confusing...

I think next time I want just a pizza and fries I'll go to a real pizzeria...."
q4kYhQSEyjixWXYP55mXvw,1,"Very disappointed in the food and especially the service we had at Biscuits Cafe the last weekend in July 2018. We had not been there in about a year. The normally great French toast was soggy and under cooked. The waitress however really made the experience underwhelming. She was not at all friendly, never checked on us once we received our food and didn't apologize when I told her that my food was bad. The manager did remove my food charge from our bill. So sad because this had been a fun and friendly neighborhood cafe with terrific food. Not sure what has happened."

But noooo... When I got there, the mechanic was very nice but his supervisor butt-ed in and UPSOLD everything like crazy! Wow. Quite annoying. Never going back here again.

5 stars for the mechanic, but ZERO stars for the manager. I know it's his job but man, ease up on the upsell. Felt like he was shoving prices up my ass."

hSYZTZa03YzEHUKRpAbt_A,1,"Walked into this restaurant at 5:45pm on a Saturday evening. There was a sign that said ""wait to be seated"" but there was no hostess around. So we went up to the bar top and sat down. It was so hot in there. No AC. There were only two standing fans. Only four customers total in the whole restaurant and they were all sitting at the bar with a beer, so I know that the place was open for business. We sat at the bar for 15 minutes without ever seeing a single employee, being greeted or being addressed. We got up and walked out."
IZwn8bN2ZEGLBp6tv0JTbg,1,"Okay so Ulta Salon is equivalent to a Super Cuts. Their stylist are a hit and miss on level of skills. 
The Salon is DIRTY and they use dirty tools on you if you do not stay on top of them. Every time I have been to Ulta Salon there is hair everywhere and I have to ask them to clean just so I can sit or put my purse down. 
They are expensive for a chain salon, ex. haircut by Jr. stylist $50!
If you decide to try them ask for a ""Master Stylist"" then be very specific as to what you want done and good luck."

She was very personable and funny, didn't take herself too seriously and engaged the audience on numerous occasions.   I have been a fan of hers since I was 9 years old and it was so cool to finally see her in person after listening to the ""Xanadu"" and ""Grease"" albums so much that I warped them!  Awesome night all around."
i-GEaPle5813PRP4g3qoug,3,"I was surprised when I noticed that Slickables served Thrifty ice cream. I honestly didn't know how I felt at first. I came here to try something new, but Thirty ice cream makes me nostalgic of my childhood since that is were my mom and I used to go together all the time in San Diego. I have nothing bad to say about the ice cream. Thirty ice cream will always be good and dependable. 

What I like about this place is that they could have marked the prices up on their product, especially their ice cream sandwiches, but they didn't. For $1.50 a scoop or $2.50 an ice cream sandwich, you are on your way to a good dessert. If your not looking for ice cream, you can buy the cookies alone or brownies. I didn't see how much the brownies were, but the cookies are $0.50. I appreciate a company that is not greedy. It says a lot about the owners.

The cookies were nothing special, but it provided a nice little crunch with my ice cream. I ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with my rockie road ice cream. Sometimes, chocolate ice cream is too much for me so the cookie helps break it up a little for me."
s1n-7B-87ncEF109QKejrQ,3,"The good - Units and complex are nice, common areas are always clean and well kept by the maintenance staff, amenities are top notch

The bad - Very expensive for Arizona, cheap appliances that seemed to always have some issues, tiny washers and dryers, toilets that don't properly flush (I had maintenance out on several occasions but they could never fix this), lots of road noise from Camelback

The worst part of my whole experience living at the Optima is definitely dealing with the management.  I move into a brand new 2 bedroom unit expecting it to be spotless when it is in fact covered in drywall dust from the construction.  They sent some cleaners the next day but at that point I had already moved my stuff in and then had to spend part of a day still cleaning.  Not a good experience to start out.  For the first few months there seemed to be new management staff in the office about every week.  The package pickup was very unorganized for a while until they finally got some stability in the office.  What really upset me were the charges after I moved out.  They stick everyone with about a $500 cleaning and repair bill regardless if the unit needs it.  I tried to dispute the carpet cleaning charge but the office would not return my phone calls or respond to my emails.  Finally I get a notice a couple months later that it's going to be sent to collections.  I call the office to discuss and the person I talked to was completely clueless and said just to pay the bill.  I settle up everything except the $200 and they did finally send it to collections.  It was more about the principle of the situation and being bullied by the Optima management to pay whatever made up move out fees they make up.  I thought they would let the $200 go after I dropped over $36K in rent and moved into a filthy apartment.  Definitely the worst management staff I've dealt with!

Update - So I paid off the balance with the collections company in order to hopefully get this taken off my credit report. They said I would I would have to have Optima remove it so I took the receipt to the office and spoke with Denise Gable (Operations Manager). She informed me that they would not delete it even though I paid the balance. I explained that this killed my credit score and I was unable to qualify for a mortgage and she still refused to remove it. I then had to resort to hiring an attorney to get it removed! Sad!"
QNaH1yWJLc7rbxGjiuDzSQ,1,"Came here for Goyemon's 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event. They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (www.mongroupevent.com). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text. 

Upon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original ""promised"" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That's bad on their part. They've been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster? 

SO ANYWAY.....

When our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there's a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in's as well. Though it may have been ""Said"" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better ! 

With that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already. 

Ordered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start. 

Blue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick. 

Wagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and ""broken"" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The ""carrot?"" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed. 

Foie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion. 

Toro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to ""Savor"" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD ! 

Amaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice ""bite"" texture. fresh. 

Uni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness. 

Overall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint."

Front desk customer service was good, I had a few questions about my account and they were answered with no issues. I've had too many problems in the past so I was hesitant but they did what they needed this time which is why I am back as a member. 

The workout equipment has been updated and I was happy to not deal with the large crowd that normally is here for the ""afterwork"" rush hour. Enjoyed my workout with no complaints so next time I'm back on this side of town I will stop by again!"
UiBjW65ozkTu87E4jUaicA,5,"When you find yourself feeling disappointed by the fact that you have to buy an item, in this case cheese, at a grocery store you can surely say Global Cheese is doing something right. 

They are helpful and knowledgeable. They are generous with samples. They have olives and cured meats at the back. They have really yummy sour cream, greek yogurt, tzatziki, different cream cheeses and spreads, amongst other things in fridges to the left of the counter when you walk in. I would strongly recommend to go at less busy times so you can have the best possible experience. It can get crowded and it closes kind of early, so going morning or mid-day during the week is best. Bring cash or debit (or both)! 

PRO TIP! If you are on a budget be mindful of the accumulating items. It is not necessarily expensive, it is actually quite reasonable and even cheap for some items, but it is soooo easy to get carried away. If you have no budget... perfect! Get what you need and make sure to try something new"

I really only come for the pizza; the dough is a lot thicker than what I'm typically used to, but it's totally worth the caloric splurge.

R27F_epnnbLddxYJAN0hBA,4,"FINALLY!!!!! 

I moved to PHX about 6 months ago. Obviously, I expected to find lots of great Mexican places. So, on a Friday afternoon I had some extra time and a strong craving for Mexican. When I found out Guy from DDD had paid this place a visit, I had to give it a whirl.

First - it is TINY! I actually drove right past it the first time. The service was top notch with my waitress guiding me thru the menu. Unfortunately, at the time I am *starving* so looking at all the possibilities and making a decision is practically impossible.

About that time, the waitress walks past me with a quesadilla... It was love at first sight!!!!! And again at first bite!!! I went with the pork shoulder with pineapple. The thing about these quesadillas - think a Mexican version of a calzone! Which is basically pure magic. I can usually put down some serious food - I could barely finish 1/2 of the quesadilla. 

Based upon the reviews, I had to order the Horcheta. WOW! They were not exaggerating about the size. It was a steal for $4. 

My only regret was that I only had room for the Horcheta for desert. I saw another table with what i assumed was tres leeche cake - it looked delicious!!!! Next time perhaps.

This is my current place to beat for Mexican. 1000X's better than The Mission... Especially considering dinner for 4 at The Mission was $100+.... Here it would have been maybe $50."

yEb-WxPbKH6vmYLwmggfcA,4,"I got the deal of the day: Gyro sandwich and Fries for $7.95 !!! What a deal ?!?!?!?! Do not miss it, or they may offer the same combo for $15 later !!!

I do not count the lettuce, tomatoes and other stuff. I pay for the gyro, that is the meat, but I do not think I got the amount of meat that means $8 to me. To be honest, I do not know the weight of the meat, but my guess is it was less than 4 oz, probably 2 oz. You need to tell me buddy how much meat you are offering in your wraps and you should obey your own rules.

In my opinion, $6 for that combo (tasteless gyro wrap & tasteless fries) is more than enough, not a deal of the day, of the week, or the month. If you want to call it a deal, add a free 20 oz drink to the combo and offer it for $6. 

I am one of those who misses the tastes offered by Istanbul Grill. Istanbul Grill was offering the similar gyro sandwich & fries even for more: $9. But, I was enjoying fully what I was eating: Their bread, gyro, and even fries, I mean every bite in the package was full with its own flavor and taste. 

It is very clear that the previous chief is not there any longer. Where is that chief now? If anyone knows, please write it here. I want to go to his new place and suggest everyone else to pay to the person who knows how to cook Turkish food in prefect way, instead of anyone who runs a Turkish food restaurant with inexperienced cooks."
cMIt8gioTw0t5S16drs9Lg,5,Zin the best! I've been coming here for about a year now and she always listens to my needs and where I'm hurting and manages to work out all my knots in one hour!! I will always come here for her and the massages and great service!!
MNWz0GFeQhOlzvYZH_mERg,3,"Blue Ribbon Sushi ......OR......""Blue Rip-Off Sushi""!??  I can't believe this place.  First of all the presentation is aaaayit...nothing great.  The name of the place says it all. If you want to make it a casual blue ribbon title, then and hand out paper napkins, then you need to charge blue ribbon strip mall prices!  Yes, paper napkins!  I mean sushi can get messy and you just have this one paper napkin but you're buying cut rolls that cost $28 or higher, for like 4 pieces. $28 for the most basic roll in existence, a caterpillar roll!  I mean i would get it if it had toro in it but it was basic ingredients.  When I asked the manager about the situation with the napkins he said they have been ""considering it"" and brought me over some linen napkins which was really nice of him.  He said it's becasue they are trying to create a fun non stuffy casual atmosphere. But even fun people eating a nice expensive dinner before going clubbing would appreciate a clean, neat and comfortable dining experience.  Especially if you expect us to drop a couple of benjamins here.  

The sushi was seriously just OK, nothing amazing or memorable. I've had way better at hole in the wall sushi joints in California, but they've got Nobu egos here when creating the prices. 

The two stars are for our nice, patient and helpful server. He was great.  When all was said and done, our bill was over $250 for two people.  I forgot about the sushi about an hour later and did not even think the experience or decor was that great for being in the new, fancy and almighty Cosmopolitan.  

Go if it's convenient for you if you're staying in the hotel, but there are way better sushi places in town. I prefer Sushi Roku."

wQ5whK7Pr42iRsX9IIH7lw,3,"So I would give this place a three star due to their heath bar and maple bacon yogurt flavors, BUT their tart is not good at all-- and c'mon you judge a froyo place based on their tart yogurt. My fiance and I went there today and sampled the tart yogurt before indulging into our cravings, and all I can say is THANK GOD. The tart tasted rancide, like bad sour milk. We notified the owner and she said that is what ""European tart"" tasted and that she tasted it that morning and everything was fine.  Well... that would be a good enough explanation, except that all tart yogurts are European tart yogurts so try again. 

I don't think I will be going back."
aubrJJ_xiRAOOZhoklKpWA,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed dinner at FnB. The service was prompt and friendly -- I was welcomed and offered a table immediately. Waited for my friend and they brought Pellegrino when I asked for sparkling H20. We split the Jerusalem artichokes (with caramelized onions and feta) as an appetizer and these were fantastic. I then had the asparagus with egg and my friend had the gulyash -- both super tasty and generous size. We ordered a bottle of Corsican Vermentino which was lovely --they have a surprisingly creative wine menu. 

All in all a super satisfying meal!"

I9upl0-Ru8PPXlc0tc-9ZA,1,Service here is hit and miss.  Some time you would get a waiter who got out of the wrong side of his bed and would get annoyed because the customers are not well versed with all the nuances of Chinese cuisine.   Just when French waiters are learning some manners now one would have to deal with pompous Chinese waiters.

The sushi is what you expect from all you can eat - a bit scaled down versions. The service is so/so. The price is as expected (around $20/person).

Make sure you try the cream cheese won tons and the seaweed salad."

We walked in and found that the sitting area was filthy and floor hadn't been swept in days. The serving size here is minuscule in contrast to our local chipotle. When they gave us such a small serving of rice, I asked for a side to make my meal more filling...the employee proceeded to fill a salsa cup with rice... We then cancelled our order and ate at ChikFila...thanks for nothing chipotle.."

NINo9eYMnaABrVXztlFiPw,4,"We just got back from here tonight and we couldn't stop talking about how much fun we had!

I'm 29 and my SO is 32. We've been attending haunted Halloween attractions annually since we were in elementary school, and we've been to different ones in different parts of the country. We've been to really disappointing attractions and really mind-blowing ones. We're not people who scare easily, but we love horror-related anything and have to check it all out.

Here's why we loved The Crypt:

-It's a GOOD deal! It's $25 for 3 attractions. It wasn't super crowded and we maybe waited 15 minutes max at one of the lines. I realize this could change but I wouldn't recommend getting the fast passes because $25 was definitely a deal and cheaper than other Halloween attractions in the area. Oh and parking is free! (It's in the parking lot of Mesa Community College.)

-There are THREE attractions!
One is The Asylum, which has trick doors where you can get lost. Has a medical motif, but still mixed it up with some other creepy themes. Asylum was definitely our favorite.
Then there's Chaos, which is a clown-themed maze, and you have no idea where to go or what's going to appear in front (or behind) you.
And there's The Crypt. It was kind of a smorgasbord of themes that didn't fit into the other two. It was paced really well-- you didn't feel hurried or pushed through and spent time enough to feel a little uneasy and pursued.
Cheap thrills and jumps, and some were genuinely creepy. They got us a number of times and we left each one laughing our a$$es off being chased by an actor.

-The actors were passionate! Plenty made us genuinely laugh and a good number creeped us out. I was surprised since we went a little later in the night that they still were high energy and clearly going out of their way to give us a good experience. We couldn't stop commenting to each other about a few actors that really stood out to us.

-Like I mentioned above, short lines, wait times weren't bad at all.

-They ensure that you only go into each attraction with a small group. This is important because going in large groups has definitely ruined our experiences at other attractions in past years.

-There were all different age groups in attendance to the attractions and it looked like everyone was having a great time. I'd say the largest age group was 20s-30s.

-The overall attraction is more intimate and not oversaturated, and I feel like that makes it more desirable. We chose this over 13th Floor and Fear Farm because we know the lines at those places were going to be long, the tickets more expensive, and the actors are going to be tired out, and the groups you'll go through the houses with will be big. So we went to The Crypt instead and we did not regret it.

Definitely recommend this place for a night out that you won't regret :)"
KHtgGLD0CDZtxsDuyzNs2A,5,Can I say bomb.com so good and tasty made fresh 24 hours and drive thru btw it will take you awhile to order they have tons of food but more the merrier. I love it just like Alberto's in California and great prices

oSTqO0jye-lzqUltJ43nqg,1,"Last night we arrived 10 min before closing time. Open sign was on but the door was locked. The girls working  and there friends  just sat there staring at us and refused to open the door. It was my wife and I and another couple. If you close at 10:30 then close at 10:30, not 10:20. All we wanted was some pre made yogurt  from the deep freeze. Ended up going to Freddie's frozen custard down the street and spent $30 there."
zTnw81EZ-ibaEl4rjE9oFA,1,"I don't like this airport, I really don't like this airport.

I was stuck here on a layover to Florida. Landed at 9pm and was hoping to find some food to hold me over until my red-eye took off. To my surprise, nothing in my terminal was open. At 9pm? Are you kidding me. The only available food came from the duty free shops in other words cold sandwiches and a bunch of processed snacks. 

The terminal was outdated and dirty. Someone puked a few feet away from me while I was charging my phone in one of the lounge areas and it took over an hour for someone to come by and clean it up. The smell spread, I moved away to avoid the smell, but I could still smell it. 

I tried to take a nap since my flight wasn't until midnight, but the seats were uncomfortable and it was too packed for that.

Finally, I'm about to board and leave this horrible place, but the ticket scanner is out of service and they have to do this the caveman way. The process was so slow. I was ready to board my plane and get as far from Phoenix as possible.

This experience alone has lead me to avoid booking flights that have layovers in Phoenix. I hope we never meet again."
suQ74v0Do_1exaBNPnqaPw,3,"Food and service were top notch.   First thing I thought when I got seated was that the movie ""Casino"" if not filmed there,  had sets modeled after this place. It was clean, but very retro. My biggest complaint?  I ordered the petit filet with bernaise sauce, and was asked house or Caesar salad. Not add, just choose.... I ordered the Caesar, and it was very good, but I would only eat small amount so as not to ruin my meal. Guess what?  It was an a la carte item I would not have ordered..it was an additional. '$12.  I felt misled. Do I mind spending good money for good food?  Not at all...but I would not have not have spent $12 on something I knew I would not eat very much off."
J8qQiYKojp1JW6ehTt3JvA,5,"Restaurant is clean & the menu is has some very creative items.. They serve breakfast meals, burgers, bowls, protein frozen yogurt, smoothies, etc. I have only been twice.The first time, I had the pleasure of meeting the owner Larissa Reis, who was a total sweetheart. I ordered the Acai bowl, but they had run out of Acai.. so she made a great recommendation for something else. Second time around, I waited for my to-go order for quite sometime. I will be back to try again, though."
iLnjuCtqO2y8aB-jtVxtrA,4,"came here on a sunday night for a friend's bday. we couldn't decide what to eat so we went on yelp to find restuarants. we narrowed the list down my the ratings and price range. came across Mon Ami Gabi inside Paris Hotel. 4 stars, a french rest, & with 2 dollar signs!  so we decided to check this place out.  Forgot to call in for reservations, always call in advance for reservations by the way (it's crowded!) we came in at 730pm, for a party of 8, we waited for 30 min which wasn't too bad. We were glad we chose the outside seating. the view was amazing. we had the table right in front of Belagio water show. very nice seating. Most of us ordered either the new york steak or filet mignon- my friends had no complaint of the food. I ordered the salmon with spinach and walnuts- amazing!  I asked the waitress do they have anything special for my friends' bday, towards the end, she brought out a plate of vanilla ice cream cake, free of charge too. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was that it seemed like they were rushing us out.  We got the table around 815, and left before 10p.  The price is extremely decent for the quality of food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"

For our meal we had camarones inperiales, campechana, camarones a la diabla, empanadas de camaron and quesadillas..all of the food was made to perfection and it was super delicious. The michiladas were great and a great cure for our hangovers. My only complain is all the people that go into the restaurant to sell you souvenirs. During our meal a man came around our table and took a couple of pictures...a few minutes later he came back with our pictures developed in a frame and demanded $15! We were never told we had to buy the pictures if he took them. Another lady also came up to us and put a bouquet of flowers in our husbands hands and said you need to give these to your wife and pay me $20. She stayed in our table for a good 20 minutes trying to convince all our men to buy a bouquet. Overall I would say the food is awesome but you should get rid of all the sales persons that go in trying to hustle you for $$"

44tGjOU0unV124BplkQfYw,4,"When Yardbird opened up earlier this year, I was dying to get in there and eat. For whatever reason, it took a few months us to finally go, but it was my birthday, and as good of as a reason as ever. We just recently went again for the second time for a friends birthday, and Yardbird has definitely solidified itself as one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.

A quick tip for those coming in for the first time. I think it's a lot easier to come into the The Palazzo parking garage off Spring Mountain. When you park, there's elevators that take you right up into the casino, then a short walk through the area with the big fountain, and Yardbird is right there. For me, that garage seems a lot easier to access, and it's almost never full either.

Anyhow, the restaurant itself is pretty cool. A bit smaller than you would expect, but we recently found out they have a little private dining area as well. It, like the rest of the restaurant has a lot of homey, classic southern style decor. Lots of wood, old pictures, and the private room has a wall full of liquors and a view of the wine cellar. They also have a nice section of the wall with a hidden TV that rotates pictures of musicians. If you have a large party to eat with here, definitely ask if that room is available. It makes for an even more enjoyable experience.

Now, the menu at Yardbird is pretty stout. It might seem small at first glance, especially since only one page is dedicated to food...but there's a lot of options, and the portions are huge. Their food is meant to be shared, so order up and have at it family style. 

So far, we've only been for brunch, but I think we've had just about everything on that menu besides the salads. Out of the 5 starter small plates, the only thing we haven't tried is the pork, but everything else is spectacular. Stand outs for me are the Fried Green Tomato BLT and the Mama's Chicken Biscuits. Both on the pricey side at $14, but worth every cent. And that's not to take away from the Deviled Egg's or Chicken Liver Toast either, which are equally impressive, and even quite a bit cheaper.

Moving on to the main dishes, you can't not mention the Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles. Yes, it's $36...but if you're idea of eating good involves chain restaurants and fast food, you shouldn't be here anyway. Not to mention, it easily serves 3 or 4 people, maybe more depending on what else you order. The chicken is absolutely amazing. Crispy, crunchy, but still tender and juicy. Their cheddar cheese waffles are unbelievable, and they serve them with this green tomato pepper jam stuff that ties everything in for a taste bud party. And I'm not even a watermelon fan...at all...but I enjoy their spiced watermelon served alongside it as well. 

The Shrimp n' Grits is another stand out for main dishes. A large bowl of creamy grits, topped with large, juicy shrimp, and little crispy bits of ham make for an excellent breakfast. It's another higher cost plate at $28, but even it can be shared with at least 2 people no problem.

A lot of there smaller items off their ""Odds and Ends"" menu are great too. First time visits, I'd suggest ordering the Macaroni & Cheese and Skillet Cornbread. And when you're done with all that, look right over to the right for dessert items. Since I've never had something there I didn't like, I'd say go for it all. The Mini Bacon Doughnuts, Chess Pie, Hickory Smoked Chocolate Coffee Cake and Cinnamon Apple Hand Pies are all excellent choices. 

My one and only biggest gripe with Yardbird is not so much the service itself, as it's almost always excellent, but both times we've been here, they have forgotten dishes. Our first time here, they completely left out an order of Deviled Eggs. This past visit they forgot to bring out an order of Shrimp n' Grits, so one of our party had to exit the room and go ask for it. Then when it came time to order dessert, they completely forgot an order of the bread budding. Luckily we were all pretty much at breaking point, but it's irritating to say the least. Especially when this place specializes on family style eating and having guests order multiple plates. To be honest, I'm not even 100% sure if we paid for the missing items on either visit either. 

When all is said and done though, Yardbird is seriously one of the most enjoyable and memorable places to eat. It's not crazy expensive for what you get, and if you come with a group of people, the experience is even that much better, and your bill will be cheaper to split. On both occasions we've spent close to $300, but that's for big parties of 8 or more, and with tip. There's not many places you can spend about $30-$40 per person while getting that much food and being able to sample that many items. 

Trust me, the bird is the word."
kQDTCk6k-KCDQbKO-N9Tmg,1,"Avoid this place like fungus on nails. There are many things wrong with this establishment. it is perhaps the most uncleanly nails place I've ever gone into, and I've gone to many in my day.

- Heaps of garbage laying on the floor
- English barrier problem to a high degree
- Nothing is organized
- Cuts nails way too short (see English barrier problem for reference)
- Does not take visa, only debt and cash
- Fans are room fans to dry toenails
- Feet placed on phone book beneath a desk to dry feet so feet do not touch ground directly
- As far as I could tell none of the instruments or stations were cleaned or sterilized before use"

I was looking for a sofa cover.. and lo and behold found the perfect one in Prime condition for 10 bucks.. same one in stores for 60$.. so that made the trip to North Las Vegas worth while.. picked up some other odds and ends and enjoyed the experience.

-5fDQi3EdxJIWylF5sQaMg,5,"Update the sandwhiches are still rock solid here but they have had some service problems on my last two visits.  They aren't using a very good turket these days either.


Hands down the best Deli in Las Vegas, and one of the best in the Western United States.  The Reuben here is legendary. Understated on the menu, but good luck on finishing it'! Do yourself a favor--  don't delve into researching it too much, Carnegie's take on the Reuben is exaggerated, excessive, extra ordinary, over blown, and over executed, it's a masterpiece. Let it be a surprise. 

My gripe would be the turkey they serve here. It's above average, but it pales in comparison to the outstanding corned beef and pastram, which is as superior as any in the country. 

The diner style dishes are prepared fresh, things like Meat Loaf, fried chicken, open faced burgers are superb. 

Breakfast is excellent, and reminiscent of what you'd find at any great Manhattan deli.

All the bread is fresh baked on the premises, and the service is quick.***brutally busy at times, sometimes it's smart to show a little green to the hostess.

Sat down soup and teriyaki bowl came out first soup was warm not hot. Teriyaki bowl look delish, out came sushi that looked good but very smaller than what I'm use to seeing at AH-SO. Four bites into my soup and crunch???..ouch! I spit into a napkin and it's a sharp piece of plastic in my soup. I got the register girls attention she came over saw the sharp plastic piece and apologized for it she went back to the kitchen came back to tell me it was from a container that shattered and refund only $30.08 of my $32.? No manager comes to see, not even a full refund or offer to come back and try it again? I got a percentage of what I paid to have bitten down on to a sharp plastic piece that was in my food..? Wow!! I called their GM left message. Waiting for a call back. I'm confused but is this customer service and that piece was lodged in between my back teeth when I bit down. I don't think so...."
8ZbRi5-8Py1B6B6oumHNQg,4,Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.

Def the place to go when you are trying to save money while not skimping on the quality."
etakUJ-LII_tedMNGLurWA,5,I really enjoyed this stop. The Yelp reviews don't do this place justice. In town visiting and wanted a place to grab a quick bite. The portions are large and ordering from the appetizer menu was PERFECT! The live band on Saturday night was good and added to the Cajun vibe. The only con is that the seating is very few but makes sense because the food is delicious. I ordered the mussels Mississippi style a MUST TRY!
lh8NacdTD6XWYm9Y9y7mWQ,5,"FINALLY had the chance to try this place. Super cute little Korean fusion dive bar on the Ossington strip.  It's usually quite packed and you may find yourself waiting for a spot but it's worth it.  Wandered in here the other night for post-dinner drinks and also Round 2 of dinner.  I only tried a couple items off the menu, which consists of snack sized and larger items - The Loosey, which is basically a decadent version of a big Mac, and the Tofu, which was quite honestly the best thing ever. It's deep fried, spicy, and the perfect pairing with a cold refreshing beer.  I would recommend both those items for sure!  

They have a limited selection of beers and cocktails, but the place is meant to be more of a snack bar anyway.  Prices are reasonable as well!"

I'm excited to try the breakfast sandwich next time. The interior was awesome, all open to the patio (its November so the weather was beautiful). Very cute. Overall, 4/5. I would suggest this place."

Jhvg9J5a3P5pwddvImrQyw,3,"We're Rolled Ice Cream fans (this same chain from Summerlin)! We were excited they opened one up on this side of town. We no longer have to travel too far to have it.

Just a couple gripes. I don't like the set up here. Once you enter, you think the line is its normal length from the one end of the room to the entrance, just like the other location. Instead, there is no line to place your order. You go straight to the cashier surpassing the long length of people who already paid, but just waiting to be called up for their order to be made. 

I felt stuck, even though I'm sure I could have asked for a refund if I wanted. As opposed to just leaving a line once your impatience bell rings lol. I also didn't like how our 4 separate orders were made in 3 different sections by different people. It was hard to keep up with my kids who each wanted to watch their ice creams being made. 

I like Summerlin's set up where you stand in line and wait to be helped. You place your order with your one guy, and they take care of the whole thing for you, then you pay at the end. Prices are just a little more at this location. There's a loud and pretty obnoxious worker at this location that swore he was a Japanese teppanyaki/hibachi worker. Too boasty but as I watched, he wasted his energy more on his trying to interact and entertain than making the Rolled ice cream to the ""Rolled ice cream"" standard. His rolls kept falling apart.

We gotta show love to Benecio and Shakira though. Benecio went straight into it and perfected my rolls of ice cream. My husband was in disbelief with how good Shakira's rolls were too lol. We'll definitely be back, maybe when it's less busy. I'm hoping they can change their set up to be like Summerlin's. We still enjoy the flavors and the experience in general."

RRrhDvz6IIrSU-TvuOEoXA,5,"I have been seeing Dr. Cherrington for over a year now.  This is the nicest staff/group of people I've been exposed to in a dental office. Dr. Cherrington recommended a crown for me based on an x-ray he took. I asked some very difficult questions to him about whether this was really necessary, and he took the time to write a detailed answer to my e-mail explaining why he felt it was.  I believe there is a high level of integrity here. This morning, I actually got the crown, and honestly, as far as procedures like that go, it was great.  I felt no significant pain including the needle going in, and the drilling...sure some discomfort, but the novacaine has worn off, everything went great, and now I can avoid root canal in the future.  Laura is one of the Dental Assistants, and she always does a great job cleaning my teeth.  The whole office has a good vibe..upbeat, and with a sense of humor, but professional and efficient Highly recommended!"

I recommend going into this show in an altered state of mind. If your not relaxed and ready to have a good time then this is not the show for you.

It's raunchy,funny,a little gross, non-stop and action packed. We were not ready for the party to end. We went last Friday and everyone, including the crowd, brought their A game!!!"
J_NJRVPsxiOhiDmsvgprhQ,3,"Decent little chocolate shop across the street from the arboretum and Lake Wingra. The single source sipping chocolate was delightful and came served with little side of whipped cream. The sipping chocolate was thick and rich with a nice texture. Companion sampled the spiced hot chocolate which she thoroughly enjoyed.   

They also have some interesting house made chocolates. I wasn't a fan of of the curry coconut chocolate, despite my love of current. This said the Ghost Chili Truffle - Shazam... you really need to just order one and give it a shot

Note there is parking in the back of the building which can be a big plus in this neighbor."
kFjz011lVVLmO5vRupuYLw,5,"This was my first experience at Wassabi's. A couple of my friends and I dined here because one of them told me about it, and living in the Charlotte area and having had sushi from a great many Japanese restaurants, I would have to say that Wassabi knows how to throw down on some fantastic tasting sushi. Service there was great, inside aesthetics were definitely pleasing, especially the mural in the back, and well, the sushi was on point! If you like spicy, Mafia roll. Spicy and fried, then the heart attack. Fried calamari was awesome, especially with the dip it came with, having a sweet and spicy tang to it. Stuffed fried jalapeños were on point, and the dessert, red bean ice cream with a little bit of strawberry syrup on top, it was just what was needed to top off the night. If you love sushi, live in Gastonia, or even live 20 minutes away like I do, this place is worth it! Will definitely be back for another visit!"
KSrRd4Ha8xBUvrBc7phoig,4,"We've looked at a bunch of souvenir shops on the Strip and this place has the largest variety of things.  Found a large inventory of magnets and paperweights.  Prices are much more reasonable and affordable compared to smaller shops.
The staff is pretty helpful and nice here too. 
It's on the other end of the Strip and requires a long walk to get there which is miserable in the heat when it's nearly 100 degrees outside."
k_IXyLBh0RXWXC-OuZx3vQ,1,"Terrible property management!!! I'm not sure how they stay in business. They take forever to fix anything wrong with the house. We're renting a three bedroom and can't even use the one of the rooms bc of water leakage. Calling Cynthia does nothing! Their handyman shows up drunk and can't fix anything right. He just does quick fixes and we're still having the same problem. Now they're saying we haven't renewed our lease since 2013!!! 

Take note and DO NOT RENT FROM THEM! 
 
Sending in a complaint to the real estate board. Let's see how they like that!



This is so frustrating! My husband went to talk to Cynthia. The handyman they continue to send out is her husband. He has shown up drunk. He admitted to not knowing how to fix the roof and ceiling. When my husband told her this, she started yelling at him, saying he does know how to f*#!'ing fix it. Mind you, he was in his uniform! At that point he walked out and called professional standards at the real estate board. Talking to them, they were absolutely appalled at them. I had to call my dad, his name is on the lease still. He called Tami- she is not a licensed realtor- and told her what was going on. My dad is currently battling cancer again. She told him that she would take care of this for him. That they would be sending out a professional roofing company out to fix the problem. This was on 04/12/16. She also asked my dad to ask us not to send in the complaint to the board. 


10 days go by and I had not heard anything. It started to rain again so I call Tami. I asked her what was going on with the roofer. She puts me on speaker phone to talk to Cynthia about it. I don't see why she had to talk to her when she assured my dad that she would take care of this. I remind her of that, so she yells at me that, that's not her job and she never said that. By now I am pretty irate over this situation. I yelled back at her saying this is disgusting the way they treat their tenants and no one should have to deal with this. I also told her that was going to send in the complaint finally since they do not want to fix this problem. All she said was do what you have to do. Not once has she said sorry, or I'll do what I can, or anything that was helpful. 

I immediately call the board. 

04/25/16 Jan from the board calls me back. Gives me some instructions on what my options are. Apologizes for what we have to go through. 

04/25/16 a roofer comes at 0730. He works for KB Homes. Finally a pro! He climbs on the roof and tells my husband that he was scared up there. The roof is closing to collapsing!! He comes inside to take pictures. Wes their shoddy repair work in my daughters room. Even he is appalled!! Tells us that he will get his crew out next week. 

04/29/16 my husband pays rent. Speaks to Tim. Asks to speak to their broker to make him aware of his employees and their attitudes. Tim gives my husband a card for their ""broker"" but the card just says he's another realtor. 

My dad calls me saying this company wants to look at the roof. We Google to number and it comes up with the name Cynthia. Why a diff company? 


This is how they treat a member of law enforcement!!"
HVM3Mn65X9AQO7K9UBIvmw,4,"My husband,  son, and I were out and about when we realized we were all hungry.  We happened upon this little mom and pop place and decided to give it a try.
   My husband and I both got the Bento Combo. He got lemon chicken and I opted for the curry chicken.  For about $9 you get teriyaki chicken, another entrée,  an eggroll, salad, crab puff, and soup.
   The teriyaki chicken was excellent. The meat was tender and the sauce was delicious.  My husband's lemon chicken was amazing! I wanted to keep stealing bites. Their curry chicken is just right. Not overwhelmingly spicy, seasonings just right. This was my 1 year old's favorite dish.
   The soup and salad were nice and the eggroll was pretty good too. My husband enjoyed the crab puffs.
   The restaurant is nicely decorated and the woman working the front was very sweet. 
   My only gripe was having to pay 35 cents if I wanted to refill my small soda.
   We'll definitely be back if we find ourselves in the area."
3KFeUh2vpGPqjU63Zubc8A,2,"So I want to love this place, but today was tough. The drinks were phenomenal, Bloody Mary and mojito, and the staff is nice, but the burger was very odd. We ordered the turkey burger and it was full of what looked like strings, when we asked what they were I was told it was mushrooms.  I am a foodie so I initially wondered if it was saffron, nope... Looked up all kinds of mushrooms to figure out what this was and I cannot find anything that looks like this. :-( 

The sweet potato fries were great!!

If you come here, please don't get the turkey burger.."
ENRU1MEHg6uqUnw8rhHFdA,4,"I came here for lunch with a friend on a weekday and it was really busy. The place has a great vibe to it - it's hip and casual. I had the swordfish sandwich, which was pretty good. The truffle  parmesan fries didn't really taste much like truffle oil. I like that their menu has several solid options on it."
grqg1zPT96_-vT1AUTNJeQ,4,"So me and my girlfriend were on our way to Jenni Pho and across the parking lot next to zen express, I immediately see the words ""sushi burrito"". As soon as we walk in the door we were greeted, which is awesome, I love customer service. 
I did not expect the inside to be modern and set up nicely since it was a new sushi burrito joint that I never heard of. Also the wall in the dining area was decorated with neat drawing instructions on how to order and above the workers station/cashier was a nice 3 screen menu. As you can tell the owner had this nicely planned out and put a lot of money into this business. The male worker recommended the most popular ones, (we ordered the #1 which is the sashimi oishi priced at $10.95) he was very polite and was open to any questions. 
My girlfriend got hers as the bowl and I got mine as a burrito. So just to break it down the burrito

Size: Decently sized burrito compared to others

Taste: delicious, sashimi was fresh and the rice was not to sticky or dry. 

Price: $10.95 which isn't bad since that's what everyone in town pretty much charges

As for the bowl it was a generous size, although they made a mistake and gave my girlfriend a very vinegary rice, which they brought up to her as they found out themselves they made a vinegary rice batch. They offered to redo her bowl for her which was nice. 

The only thing I don't really like about this place is that they need a fountain drink machine, it bugs me when restaurants have only canned soda options. Also they might need some type of Japanese sweet desserts or pastries to finish off after a meal.

Overall I would most likely come back to this place if I am in need of a sushi fix."
TKrOQ3uOFv9UZZFjjVPsig,5,"I don't know what happened with this other reviewer, maybe one of those people that's just never happy or had something else going on? Dr. Street's philosophy is totally and completely ANTI forceful manipulation... he believes in a more holistic approach to maximize sustained long term relief and let the body adjust as it should (over time and NOT by brute force)... she must have the wrong guy?!?

I initially bought a Groupon to go see Dr. Street mid last year. I've been to chiropractors in the past and been unimpressed. So, my first visit here, I was a total skeptic. I walked in, Groupon in hand, thinking ""ehh, this is a waste, but hey it was cheap and I was going to be in the area, so whatever."" I was so wrong!

I felt so much better after just a few visits that I gave one of the longer term packages a try. Dr. Street explained the entire process (for instance, there are a few 'downs' while your body adjusts to new positioning). I knew what to expect, ups and downs, and he was dead on every step of the way!

It's taken time and commitment, but I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER than I have in the past. I thought the constant aches and pains were just kind of how it went. I feel better than I have in years, and Dr. Street's is the only care I've received. It's all because of him.

I have a CRAZY hectic schedule - do you know how many times poor Dr. Street has stayed late, once in a while until after 6 PM, patiently waiting for me? And how many times I've rescheduled on an hours' notice? I do this continually... I hate doing it, but I'm married to my job and that's my hectic life. I love Dr Street because, in addition to alleviating my pain, he's JUST A WONDERFUL PERSON! He's patient, approachable, understanding, and puts up with my crazy sort of schedule with a smile... because he's a wonderful, happy guy who actually truly cares about your well-being. They don't make people like that any more!

If you're looking for a great chiropractor, give Dr. Street a call. Take five minutes to talk to him and ask him about his chiropractic philosophy and your needs and go for a visit. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!"
2o2Sg8ROuviWY6yljXMhZw,5,We shopped all day for a mattress and couldn't find anything that met our needs. But this place changed all that. The owner gave us an incredible deal that was truly too good to pass up. Needless to say we haven't lost any sleep over this purchase.
gnleT80q7kETyVw4eaAi3Q,5,"Nicky's Thai kitchen is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been so far. I was there last Saturday afternoon for lunch, the food, service and restaurant itself is absolutely worth to give a try. Trust me if you want Thai food this is a right place for you. I like their decoration it is in side an old apartment building. Their main dining room is on first floor and the outdoor seating area is in the garden, which is perfect when the weather is nice out. But it was a raining day when I was there. I had Thai yellow curry chicken for my entree, spicy and delicious. They have other location in Peen ave I hear so much about this place and they really did a good job."
49BGNJE_Vc2KopXLk3opeQ,4,Love the presentation of the bowl unlike soho sushi.  Needs to have more choices and have better tasting rice.  Not a fan of their spicy tuna because of the cut of it.
GxCSmlM3Y58kmzNweZ1kcQ,1,"Diners beware!  Extremely poor service here.  We placed an order through JustEats but it did not go through.  The kid behind the counter refused to check my order number and simply said they never received it.  He finally called JustEats and said he rejected my order because we tried to abuse the coupon code the past few days.  It was our first time there and only discovered the code today, so it couldn't of been us.  He refused to compare my phone number to the number he claimed made the previous orders.

Anyways, it was a terrible customer service experience and I left empty handed after 20 long minutes at the restaurant.  The kid was rude and unhelpful, and honestly think he made up the excuse because he wanted to close up shop.  It's the last time I'm stepping foot in the restaurant until the service improves, they've got to realize there are TONS of other pizza options around the neighbourhood."
HGhEaCD4uo9Rl4ju-XkV6w,5,"Great place to have a group dinner! They were able to accommodate 18 people without requiring a minimum or a prix fixe menu, not easy to find a place in Scottsdale that will do this! The service, food  and of course drinks were fantastic. Well done!"
_siBgqTUb5njY7iUVA19Wg,4,"I came here for lunch for a work meeting with 5 others. It was noon and was quite busy, but we were still seated quickly. We ordered three different appetizers: the guacamole, green chili cheese dip, and spinach dip. The guac was really good. The dips all came with a large amount of tortilla chips, cucumber slices, and crostini bread.

For my entree I ordered the peanut coconut curry quinoa bowl. It was a very large serving and was heaped full of fresh veggies. There was cooked cauliflower and broccoli on top and my only problem was that the pieces were quite large and difficult to cut in a bowl filled with other items. But I really enjoyed the dish. The curry sauce was a little spicy, but not too much for my taste. I thought about requesting the recipe since I liked it so much.  I had enough food leftover to save for another meal. 

By the time we left, there were quite a few people now waiting for tables. It seems to be a popular lunch spot for a lot of professionals, probably due to its closeness to several business parks. I will go back again in the future."

Seriously dont bother, you will leave stinky and disappointed."

xPFfhrdxSOJlyfvnbwBekw,1,"This place deserves zero stars. My 3 yr only went there for 4 weeks. During that time she was bullied and came home with large bruises. I spoke to her teacher and the director about it and neither seemed to really care. When I mentioned that my daughter was being bullied, the teacher actually laughed. Very unprofessional. They are not good at dealing with food allergies either. The final straw was when my child came home with bruises on her neck and told me that the bully had choked her!! I spoke to the teacher and director again and nothing was ever done. They didn't even apologize! This place may look nice inside but it is total chaos with little teacher supervision or interaction. There's no learning or preschool activities either. I'm totally disgusted by this place."

I walked into Black Forge Coffee and asked the barista if there were available outlets . She ignored me, walked behind the counter and asked what I wanted .  Out of curiosity I asked what was the meaning behind the name of the coffee shop.  She began speaking to me in the most condescending way.

Very RUDE!! have some respect for your PAYING customers.

I don't know if that conspiracy theory is true about pumping weird air out to hypnotize people and make them spend money freely. My friend played a slot machine called ""Whale Song"". The game seemed pretty cool. The whales sing. I love all of the dumb slot games with stupid gimmicks to make people play.

The rag they were using in the cook surface was filthy as we the floor in from of the cooking area. The cashier must have told the owner I had inquired about the health grade because after I left she ask the other customer what I said to her. The Customer told me outside as she heard me ask about the Health   grade. I won't be going back to this place as the owner was very defensive she got nasty.

jxHNLnXkLCv1PMiVaEVj3A,3,"Came here with a group of friends on a Wednesday after work. We had called in advance to see if we could make a reservation for 8 but were told they do not take reservations. Fine. When we arrived around 5:30pm about half of the upstairs had reserved signs on them and was about half full...interesting. So we proceeded to go downstairs where there was more seating. The bowling alley is down there and open. Good luck getting a lane as apparently they get reserved quickly. As we sat down we were soon greeted by a waitress which was nice. The unfortunate part of the basement is that it has a totally different food and drink menu from upstairs and you could not order anything that was not on that menu (ie: a bigger selection from upstairs). this was disappointing since the food on the menu is more like snacking food. However their tacos are quite good. All in all we had a good time, but I was looking forward to trying some of the food that I had read good reviews about."
7EpXfADjKGC01jJ47_ftOg,4,"I went here to check it out and have the microbrewed beer, and I'm just glad my stomach still works. They have to have the worst beer I have ever had in my life, and I have had over 190 different bottles of beer. I had the pilsner, and I knew from the start that it was going to be terrible. It came as a cloudy medium dark gold color. Pilsners are supposed to be light gold, clear, and crisp. This was the exact opposite, and I thought of it as a confused hefeweizen.

After I mangaged to choke that down, I tried the amber ale. The color was pretty good, so I was hoping this would be better. NEGATIVE. It had no aroma, and when I went to taste it, it tasted just like the pilsner. I had my girlfriend try both the beers too, she also agreed with me. 

Bottom line, don't ever try the beer there."
OB-Y77PkT315eboivNoEOw,4,"Okay, I feel like I just never feel Hawaiian fast food, it just doesn't taste super great to me! But alone, with nothing else, the steak&pork was really good!! 

But I did get a bowl full of extra items to go with! I had a groupon, but it still kind of cost a lot because I was with my family! It was a bit too expensive for what it was. 

I'm not really sure about my entire bowl, but the sauces that I paired them with made the whole bowl way way better. I included a pic of the 2 sauces I liked the most with my bowl; it really tones the flavor down and makes it combine nicely :) 

In case you didn't see the pic, here are the two sauces:
Coconut Colada Pearl 
Pineapple, Lime & jalapeño  

They have a really great, friendly staff!!! They make you want to move to Hawaii, they're so nice! They are a friendly, super clean business ! 

The one thing that I absolutely loved was the COCONUT BARK. hell, I hate coconut..but their little chocolate brittle was hella tasty! Yum Yum Chocolate lovers! $3.50 for a small, but still, not bad at all :)"

The drink menu is not extensive but they have a full bar and a decent selection of martinis. I ordered the Bikini Martini. It was good, not great. It's a mix of pineapple, coconut and grenadine...sounds super yummy. But it was not...(that's just my opinion) I finished it but I would not order it again. 

For the meal, I went with the chicken, spinach and mascarpone ravioli. I ordered the small portion thinking it would be more than enough but I was mistaken. The plate came out with three pieces of ravioli in the parmesan cream sauce sauce. I didn't enjoy it. And I was really underwhelmed with the presentation and after a few bites it was back to Yelp to search for another spot to eat because I was still really hungry. 

Also the service was lacking. It wasn't that busy but after we ordered there were a few other guest that came in and ordered and got their food before we did...what's up with that?!? 

As we were wrapping up we felt rushed along...apparently there was an event there later that evening that they were setting up for...So it just seemed like we were in the way. Ugh. 

All in all, for the price and location I expected better. I'm not sure I'd go back."
GdUZnNQwDqPAVeBuvPjJNA,4,"$15.88 for a double well drink. A bit steep, yes, but the staff were friendly, funny, and efficient. It was a bit smokey in there, but it's the closest bar to the security checkpoint in C terminal, and a good place to sit, have a drink and charge your phone while you wait to see how delayed your flight really is and whether it's been reassigned to a different gate. I blew about an hour in here. They have a few TVs playing ESPN and whatever sports are on at the time. One of the TVs had the volume up loud enough for a few patrons at a high top to hear the game, but it wasn't so loud as to deafen the rest of us."
aI-cJX7lmFv2REebifT18w,5,"Yay! I am so happy! This place has just opened - right around the corner from my place - and it's fantastic! A family run business where the husband is front of house and the wife and another chef do the cooking. The food is prepared with pride and love and was delicious. For a newly opened restaurant the service was seamless - and even more than that - friendly and generous as we were given an additional appetiser dish on the house. It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! 
We ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish. 
They are yet to obtain a liquor license so we did not drink. 
I am very happy this restaurant has opened and I wish them every success! Go try it!! Let's keep this neighbourhood full of local, independent and family run businesses like this one! I look forward to returning."
MfLKoHKGGiZIwuSlZ9S3Jg,1,"This business is definitely in the business of ripping people off. My girlfriend took her car there to have the clutch checked out and they ended up removing her transmission without her approval, charging her hundreds for the labor, didn't fix anything, and held her car hostage until she paid them. 
While AAMCO said it would cost close to $3000 to fix her transmission, she later found out from a reputable mechanic that her problem was just a bad cable that ended up costing about $100.
Boo to you AAMCO for taking advantage of people. I say BOO to you!"

I always order the famous gyro and fish platters...

Definitely would recommend!!!"
oGv_Xg4AayuvfH5an_tQ9Q,5,"Just snuck by for a Thousand Island Burger, and you know what...it was a damn good burger.  Every ingredient was really tasty: the burger, the cheese, the bun, the toppings.  It was great.  While I was eating, I actually said out loud (to myself): ""This is a really good burger!"".

Price is outstanding.  

I'm not in town much, but when I am, I don't see why I shouldn't just go here.  Amazing!"
Z8sdgnrsqxKny1t5UsjK2A,5,Their pho is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooo good their staff are super friendly and helpful for people who haven't had Vietnamese food before. Interior is really well done.
jDfXyS_kY9IIuv5NqCqpfA,2,Extremely underwhelming...Cool to sit in the same (casual room) room as the fire pit but too pricey for what they are serving. Very small portions. Better places in the city to spend $150 (2 people). Sorry...
F5eicsBcsqMSaq3cZLR1qQ,1,"I was only going to give it 1 star but the bread (especially the pretzel bread and the olive bread) and wine were at least good!  My friend and I are on a quest to find the best tuna tartar in the valley....why?  Well, why not, I guess!  She'd googled something like ""best tuna tartar"" and City Hall came up in her search.  So sad it did because I wish I had my time and money back.  They need to send someone over to The Mint to see how tuna tartar should be made!  The price for the tuna tartar was $18 which I'd HAPPILY pay if it was GOOD but it was awful!  Instead of a nice bowl of tender delicious tuna like we had at The Mint, we got a tri-level blob on our plate.  The bottom layer was what I believe were crushed up chow mein noodles of some sort....bland and boring!  The next layer, which was about 3/4 of the blob, was guacamole....WEIRD!  And it wasn't even a nice bold flavorful guac!  Like the chow mein noodles, it was bland and boring.  Then in a VERY thin layer smeared on the top were some small pieces of raw tuna.  And guess what?  It was bland and boring too!  No surprise there, huh?  So we very disappointed to say the least.  We also opted to try the seared ahi tuna.  Another mistake!  I've eaten a LOT of ahi in my life (Salt Cellar always has beautiful ahi!!) and when I order seared ahi, I expect it to be put on a very hot grill for just a moment and then turned over for another moment and then off so that the inside is still nice and raw.  Everywhere I've had seared ahi from one side of the US to the other has been prepared that way.  At City Hall it was cooked all the way through and it really ruined it for me.  It almost seemed as if we were eating canned tuna.  Not impressed!  We would have complained to our server if we ever saw her!  I was finally able to flag her down and get our bill but by then, we didn't have time to say anything as we needed to leave.  Kudos to the valet at least! I couldn't find my ticket and was searching my purse for it when all of a sudden my friend said ""hey, he's got your car already!""   The place was pretty full so I was pretty impressed that he remember what car we were driving.....

Onward and upward to our next stop on our tuna tartar tasting tour....."
oE84c9zEnEnBp-ObvpRQNw,3,Came here Friday night and had about 4 tables of twos. When you walk in you will smell strong herbal smell but the actual noodles itself didnt have too strong of herbal smell. Beef tasted better than pork ribs. They claim no M.S.G in soup but i think they added a lot of soysauce. The soup for the beef was hotter than the porkribs. 5% off if you pay cash.

Fun place. The cinnamon rolls are LEGIT!!!!"
qxJp_c3AKU7zhHR4fNj-4A,3,"Anytime I come here, the place is empty and I can't figure out why? The place has been around for some time now so they have to be doing business (takeout?).

The food here is actually of GREAT quality! If I'm honest to myself, probably better than most other places I frequent. It's just so dead inside that when craving atmosphere as well as good food this place doesnt come to mind which is why I give 4 out of 5. 

They have many salsas to choose from, I like them all. They serve menudo which is very clean and not all grisly like at some places, however I find the bowl (serving ) to be small as compared to other places. Then again it is quality over quantity here in pretty much all circumstances.

The Shrimp and fish here are excellent.
The rice is however a little boring.

The only item here I am not a fan of sadly is their chips. I dont like the size , texture, or taste. 

Overall, great for carryout or dine in if you like the sound of crickets."
nvmsBm5IkaxMPH9_tB8aBw,4,We visited on a Friday morning and we were especially pleased with the Service. The coffee was terrific. The food was very good.I had an apricot crepe. The cheese croissant was superior. A nice place to take a friend to breakfast. No waiting in line on this date.
8RqrLem0uRcPnHgq-BDh1Q,2,Lame. Doesn't hold a candle to Five Guys. Burgers were greasy and buns were stale. The produce on the burgers wasn't great either. Fries were lame. Just a very average burger if you ask me.

Well, let me tell you. I was MIND BLOWN . I have never had a better experience eating sushi. We sat at the bar and met Chef Tae and NuNu.  They were both incredibly down to earth and funny...but most importantly (when you're hungry for some DARN GOOD sushi/fish), Chef Tae and NuNu were incredibly skilled at making delicious, mouth watering, impeccably  presented sushi rolls and sashimi dishes!!! Ahhh Im getting hungry just thinking about the food at Soho.

Conclusion: FRESH fish + AMAZING TASTING combinations of sushi rolls (very unique) + SUPER COOL chefs = i will recommend everyone to come here! You MUST TRY Soho! Come early because it gets packed!"
KiHV3biJ_r4FpkH6nCLWOQ,5,"Fabulous experience! Super relaxing and so unique!!  From start to finish, the experience was so  amazing!!

My husband and I did the couples float and enjoyed every minute of it. Felt so relaxed afterwards! Can't wait to go again- recommend this for everyone!! Great for the mind, body, and soul."
qL2ad-iM4Eau256Mmv05IA,1,"Grossed out. The older woman assigned to my pedi smelled like cigarettes and used her finger and the sleeve of her white shirt to PICK HER NOSE not once - but twice. She later wiped her eyes with the same sleeve. While working on me she also coughed on her hands and placed the callus removal tool on her floor. The tools showed no indication of having been disinfected.  

As far as my nails, she really struggled to stay on my nail and off my cuticles with the polish. Had to touch up just about every nailbed with a brush dipped in nail polish remover. I got a regular pedicure and I sat there for an long hour and a half. She seemed to be straining to see. In the end, it looked really bad."

xoc5AIQ6x2LvFBOpoh-EIQ,5,"Excellent Food! The shrimp etouffee was delicious, the green olive coleslaw was tasty, the garlic bread was fresh and hot, the catfish was quite possibly the best I ever had and the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce and pecans... just stunning. We asked for extra lemon and bread and they were there in less than a minute. 

This restaurant is a delight and one of my new favorites. I've been to New Orleans a number of times and this cajun restaurant met my expectations.

Only complaint is $2.40 for a soda."

So we came right back and again ask them to put 40 psi but they can't seem to do it or they just don't want to and I thought all tires are supposed to be even all around but look at the picture I took as we were driving home.... why is one tire only 35psi when we ask for 40????

IITWSLSWc9eMPakvpBKyNw,5,"Finger lickin' chicken chicken - what combo you be pickin'?! 

Not Canes! 

Best "" strip club"" around!  Premium, juicy breast to give Spearmint Rhino some envy. Something wrong with you if you don't check out those breasts and not lick yo lips. 

I've been back with the BF for some BFG love and back with my Yelperazzi family. Something simple sometimes is the best food. Goooooo Tin! Please keep feeding us nomlicious strips (Gotta slap some Yelpers for not giving enough love to the guy in the kitchen). 

I tried something different with the Yelpizzles and got the bibimbap special ($5.25). It was pretty solid with a variety of fresh and crisp veggies and nicely marinated chicken with a perfectly fried egg. 

Apparently there are four weekly specials on rotation: bibimbap, teriyaki bowl, hot chick sandwich, and chicken nachos. I will update as I try the other 3 specials, salad, and baked chicken.

I already have a favorite down though- crispy strips, grilled veggies and wasabi cream and sweet chili. 

Thanks- Jin, Tin, Jin's sister (we didnt get your name) and the ladies cutting up the chicken in the back for your work and hospitality. 

We're hooked!"

Worst customer experience to date, such a shame because when we bought our car there in 2011 they were fantastic and their customer service was phenomenal.

8MIVmx8B5HzjhoqrH1Npgg,1,"***Read previous reviews*** I've never written a bad review on Yelp before, but this place is an urgent care that bills like a hospital. I'm very disappointed in their billing. My insurance was in network and I'm being charged 400 dollars (700 before insurance) for basically a 2 minute bandage wrap for a burn. I had no idea it would be equivalent to an ER visit cost.  Just a FYI to others. I will never return."

8IQezDDnnKsi40Dsuua6Og,3,"They deserve 5 stars for their service.

That being said, I pretty much enjoyed two things: the drinks and one of my desserts

Did the tasting menu. Overall my palettes were confused, too many flavors competing with each other. I love savory food, but this was overkill.

- Dark Stormy Night: Rum with Ginger Beer: Not a huge fan of ginger, but this tasted just right.
- Gazpacho soup: compliments of chef. Felt like I should have bit into a fresh onion
- Bread: sourdough that was very hard and bacon roll
- Beef Tartare: the egg yolk made this dish creamy and yummy
- Pear salad with shaved brussel sprouts and macadamia nuts: This dish could have used more pears. The sprouts were bitter, and the salt was heavy handed. Again more bacon
- Rabbit wrapped in BACON: Noticing a theme here? This dish was actually pretty tasty. Hate to say it but it did taste like chicken. 
- Seared scallops with braised beef: not too bad, I finished this entire dish
- Beef belly: very fatty, which is the idea of this dish, but after one bite I had had enough. Way too rich
- Crispy Pork: very tender
- Soaked pear (not sure in what) with truffle ice cream - Pear was good, didn't care for the truffle ice cream
- Hazelnut ice cream with chocolate coffee mousse/cake-  highlight of the meal
- Warm Chocolate Soup: compliments of chef, too salty, took one sip and passed"

walqsVeKUGpeImKqlbieAw,4,"Stylish Savings

Who would have thought at the age of 12 you would be  concerned  with style and clothing. I now realize that clothes mean everything when you're a teenage, boy or girl. 

Fortunately, today there are a lot of options for teens. There are so many popular stores that cater to a younger demographic making it easy to find clothes.

Over the weekend, I took my nephew clothes shopping.  I mentioned about a dozen different stores, all of which  he responded with a head nod.  My nephew asked if we could go to Tilly's.  I have never heard of Tilly's, but thought it was worth a try. 

 I was pleasantly surprised as we walked into.  Tilly's offers men's clothing, women's clothing, kids' clothing, backpacks, shoes and accessories from all the popular brands.

The staff at Tillys  is helpful, accommodating, and they take their time helping you find exactly what you are looking for.  The prices are reasonable and a selection is large. 

If your looking for the ""in"" clothes, give Tillys a try."
bNKBIKSXJ_mG9IP47DkVtA,4,"I've stayed here twice, the first time was at the tail end of my honeymoon and after being in the tropics with bugs and all, I was ready to be pampered. The room was super clean and I just loved how you can go to the FS pool or Mandalay's pool. However, I would suggest settling yourself down in the FS pool since they help you find a seat, cover your chair, bring you water and occasionally they bring little complimentary treats out to the pool goers. Plus it doesn't feel nearly as crazy busy as the Mandalay pools. I would definitely stay here during the summers. This second time staying here I don't think we sprung for as expensive a room so though it was nice and clean, the TV, vanity and such were very much outdated. Wished they would redecorate the rooms a bit. Other than that it's a very nice hotel with amazing service."

This was my first time ever visiting a red lobster. I grew up on the coast, so when we wanted seafood red lobster was never a place that came to mind. That is until they announced their endless shrimp promotion! I love shrimp, so I figured if there was ever a good time to give red lobster a try this would be it. The service was pretty standard and comparable to any big chain restaurant, not outstanding but good. Now I can't comment on some of the other food they offer at red lobster but that endless shrimp promotion was amazing! They start you off with biscuits and a side salad. Then the entrée is any two types of shrimp and two sides. Now, at this point I was pretty full but being the shrimp lover that I am I had to keep muscling down more. Every few minutes our server would come over and ask what we wanted to try next and as advertised, the shrimp were endless they just kept bringing out more.  At the end of the meal, we had three boxes of leftover food to bring home! If stuffing your face like this wasn't such a health hazard, I would be there every night."

We decided on some sushi rolls, miso soup, and some cold sake. They did not have hot sake here, which was a little disappointing. We got our sake right away and then it began. The very very long wait for our food. 

After waiting for quite a while, our server returned to let us know our sushi would be out in 5 minutes. I had to remind her about the miso soup, no big deal but we could have been eating the miso during the wait.  

When we finally got our sushi we were excited! This was relatively good until I noticed that the rice was a little hard. My friend had the same observation. This was a little disheartening. 

I probably won't be going back to Yama anytime soon, but it was a nice meal and worth the Groupon price."

f4yHoqx9kFBJQ7oSYkJW-w,5,"I really liked this place! Went there for happy hour and they have the really good margaritas for $5. I had the mango and watermelon. I ordered the chicken quesadilla which didn't look like what you envision it to look... looked more like a Mexican pizza but it was delish. The bartenders Michael, Sal and Jeremy were AWESOME! Definitely will be back. It also had a cool ambiance."
FKVEnPPyjKUD6wp7BRw-0A,4,Really good food onion rings were some of the best I've tried. The sandwich was nice and warm and they had a really good sauce to accompany it. Staff was a little rude
EPz5AeGtmGwbYkwXsMuYFQ,5,"First time in & I absolutely loved it! The employees were so kind and gladly let me try any flavor I wished! The peanut butter crunch was to die for! The price was so reasonable! I cannot say anything bad about this place, the cherry on top (pun intended) was the service!!! Everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy their job and were happy to serve me. Can't wait to go back!!"
9qZ5VJVeBQMwziGYULJKLA,5,"This place is so good and everyone here is so nice and friendly. 
The food is authentic, fresh and beyond delicious.
Great place to eat! You have to try you will not be disappointed!!!"
mRAv9SLZMj7oVG3cm8cFDA,1,"Tried the breakfast buffet because we enjoyed the Sunset Station's buffet, this one was the complete opposite, absolutely horrid.  We were about 30th in line at 10:15am and they didn't even get us in until 11.   At that time the price changes to lunch and the food changes too.   Sorry, but if I takes you 45 mins to get us in, you should allow 15 minutes or so leeway before you start charging the lunch price.  It was a total clusterfart, and the food was terrible."
s_xb5VsRuQni1WIc-Ju7sw,5,"Birthday dinner for me! Immediately felt at home with a warm welcome, cozy decor, well worth the drive from Charlotte
Our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful.
We started with cocktails, I had the spritzer which was exactly what I wanted, and the boy had the whiskey rye drink that was boozy and just what he wanted.  We switched then to wine he brought.
For starters we had the beef tartar which did not disappoint, salty rich and on a bed of avocado! The waiter convinced us to try the oysters, which to me were only ok.
And we couldn't keep our hands off the milk bread.
The squid ink pasta was rich and flavorful with a broth we couldn't get enough of!
Finished with chocolate birthday cake.
If this is what it is like to get older, sign me up!"
h8HU48As1YKv4gqmj1ifhQ,2,no menu...  Bland interior...  The veggies aren't labeled. took forever to get  a soda. The lamb was good.. All the sauces were bland. much better off going to somewhere like Gengis Grill

Thank you for choosing us this month for your January customers of the month. The privilege is all ours! 

Special thank you to Jason, our favorite Barista!

rDM0l88yAmjRpIehf_RFhQ,1,"Eh. Nothing special. 

The wax was ok, I just asked her to clean up my eye brows because it had been a while since my previous wax. My problem was the attitude of the service. The girl asked me where I went the last time I got my eyebrows done, it's none of her business. Then she said I should never go back there because they took off way too much hair and now she can tell that the hair will never grow back in that spot. WTF why would she said that? Maybe I never had hair that grew there in the first place? I was so shocked by her comment that I didn't even know what to say. Also, my face gets very very red after a wax so I asked if there was a cooling lotion or something she could put on my face. I don't want to walk down Queen W with red splotchy skin. She put on something that made my skin burn, it was alcohol based. I'm not an expert but I don't think that's good for the skin. 

It wasn't worth the price and I hate being insulted."
7Rkhmwabk5cp8zyhgUHZvA,4,Outstanding Mexican food and very inexpensive prices.  Second time eating there and it was as good as the first.  Mixed fajita platter and chile verde platter. Terrific flavors.  Great salas. Delicious beans and rice.  I'm guessing some lard went into making those beans taste so yummy. Really good food.  Really good.
9hCwlcEt7BVPpHEP93_9WQ,5,These guys have helped me and my friends out on numerous occasions and no matter how busy they are they get it taken care of correctly and at a fair price.  Can't ask for anything better.
QWQxlseHQyqH4ozKlrEHoQ,5,"Very good and local beer selection. Great happy hour deals, 50% off!!  Katelyn recommended us a few beers, all very good! Great service! Try their belgium beer!"
exuC_Q6b1OY5sVDxHendrw,5,"Heather behind the bar is awesome! She always keeps my drinks full, the right game on tv, and has witty humor that is right up my alley. I love the Meat pizza and the salads but no matter what I always leave feeling like I got exactly what I needed."
IFbLaZQjA54daWfUvPJlsg,4,"I had the Steak Melt with coleslaw and it was delicious, greasy but that comes with eating a melt. Casual cafe style, received our food in a reasonable amount of time, a little pricey but the food is very good."
S5xCPw4eIKjC1EoEbfiNHA,5,"This is a great shop!! Carries so many variety of goods!! The customer service is impeccable!! The owner is friendly, personable and knows the products!! I would recommend this store to anyone traveling or living in Las Vegas!!"
F_O0BIbXxTFzsa2W5p2ndg,5,"I never usually have a problem with pet stores or how they run their business until I came to this store.  At first I was all excited to look at puppies and possibly gain another family member.  My husband and I were looking at all the puppies and noticed that they all seemed so calm and sleepy. I just wanted to give this company the benefit of the doubt and thought so many people played with them and since they are puppies they may be all tuckered out.

My husband then got a text message, and like any other human being with a phone, he decided to read it and text back.  Then the male employee approached him and told him that there is no pictures, videos, or Facebook allowed of the animals.  First of all it doesn't say that anywhere in the store. And second of all, it made me think that they may be doing something illegal or unethical...

I would definitely do some research on this place and their ""private breeders"" before purchasing an animal here.  Something just doesn't feel right."
DbIqNlnQsmWV54gYgRhXtw,5,"Just picked up a Rueben sandwich there, Oh my gosh, so good. I am so glad I stopped by and next trip will be trying their beef dipper!! Very fresh, very clean, very friendly. There was so much meat on the sandwich as it was on rye bread and not a sub roll so.....they dbl the meat!!"
JJgfNIzN_DBJkYVAWGM44A,5,"The Luxury Thai Spa exceeded my expectations. Upon arriving the location was in a clean area. Upon entering I was greeted with a warm smile and hug by Om. I have been to many establishment to receive services I must say this is a first class establishment with highly skilled professionals. I opted for the four hand massage, my first ever. This was a wow experience for me. The skill and attention that On and Kelly paid to every muscle fiber, sinew and trigger point was impeccable. The aromatic warmth of the massage oils permeated the room. To top that off the hot stones was icing on the cake. As a tourist in Las Vegas I highly recommend that you venture off the strip and check this establishment. In addition to massage services I look forward to receiving other services here in the future."
2qwie3Mh07ExqAdw-zBzLw,2,They burnt my panini because the girl put it on the grill and then went on break. I asked for a new one and they collectively lost their minds. I just wanted a panini y'all :(
eEaOJlxPzrn95j5g4QDS5w,5,"I've been coming to get my leg sleeve here by Fernie Andrade and we are just about done... what can I say that hasn't already been said about Mr. Andrade that his work doesn't speak for itself?! AMAZING to say the least; I'm truly blessed and honored to have his talent on permanent display. I followed him all the way from Los Angeles and I came to know the nicest, most professional shop I've ever come across. I am considered a tattoo collector and have work from some of the most renowned names in the industry, from some of the world famous shops, particularly from Los Angeles. In all honesty, Skin Design Tattoos is the premier shop. It sets the bar so high that no other shop can touch it. In terms of professionalism, they define excellence. From the appointment setting process, the deposit taking, the reminders via email and text, to the after care follow up instructions (Mario you're the man!)  they know what they are doing and they are doing it right! The artists that are all here are experts in their respective fields and talents whether it be color (Vic Vivid), portraits and black and gray (Robert Pho/Andy Pho/Fernie Andrade) or custom lettering (David Ruiz), they have every aspect covered...up to and including cleaning up and removing unwanted work with their tattoo removal service (Anthony). 

I without hesitation and with the utmost pride and honor highly recommend you give Skin Design Tattoos your business when you decide you want to get that permanent ink. The saying goes, ""A good tattoo isn't cheap and a cheap tattoo isn't good"" rings truer now than ever. Invest wisely and you will never reap regret! 

Sincerely, 

DT"
1obqQW2pGPMvl828XJ2-SA,2,"While the staff at Eddy's Deli is as friendly and helpful as in any average restaurant, their food is simply bad.

I ordered their dinner combination - meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a chicken soup. The soup smelled very bad and tasted worse. I suspected it was spoiled and only ate a spoon. Meatloaf was bland and mashed potatoes were, well... like any mashed potatoes. 

While my stomach problems the same night might have been caused by something else (but very unlikely), I strongly suspect they were caused by the food at Eddy's. I would not recommend dining at this restaurant.

The seats are also cramped."
rNKI466kJUgafkxgvHqr1Q,5,No complaints at all... the wait time isn't bad after being told I would wait hours.. the staff is nice a lot of paperwork but it's a nice environment everyone is so polite and makes sure you understand everything you're signing which is great. I'm glad I chose to come to this office.
onuly9nbHNFYZ2vXm4k4mg,4,"The food was very good, no doubt. Bang Bang shrimp, bread with a pesto dipping sauce, corn chowder with crab, Caesar salad with blackened shrimp, Maryland crab cakes, potatoes au gratin ... It was all very yummy (though admittedly a little heavy for lunch). I would definitely come back for the food. 

But the service was just meh. We had to ask for bread three times, and each time the excuse was ""we're waiting for it to come out of the oven."" Then why wasn't it hot when it finally came to the table? Toilet paper dispensers in the bathroom were mostly empty even though we were among the first customers of the day. And paying for the bill took forever. Granted, we threw them some curveballs with our coupons, but it still took entirely too long for them to tell us that the coupons wouldn't work and to process the bill. Manager also seemed a little rude and kept our coupon because he thought we were trying to scam the joint -- no, buddy, we were using a valid coupon that's worked at other locations, and it's never been a problem before. Don't appreciate the feeling that you're treating us like criminals when we also happen to be the only group of foreigners in the place. 

To end on a good note: the host was the cutest. Happy and clearly enjoys his job. He danced all around the patio when preparing for new guests, singing Taylor Swift!"
LJxkQ8jXViERv0AMTHNhoA,1,"Too expensive, small portions, taste was nothing special.  

This was what bothered by the most:  we ordered 3 entrees, 3 appetizers, 2 deserts (total $75).  However, they had the nerve to charge us to chili sauce without telling us first there would be an extra charge.  They said they would only give us one serving (which was about 1 teaspoon worth) and when we asked for more, they charged us.  We told them, we ordered 3 meals, how can we only get 1 tiny spoon of chili sauce?  They said it was their owners policy.  

There are so many other thai restaurants the the city with better tasting food (smiling banana leaf, nicky's thai). I will not go back here because they are overpriced and because of their greediness over chili sauce."
iqZpmhXeawmEdNf8Ryhebw,3,"This restaurant is definitely a step up from what use to be on campus.  It is a Mongolian bbq.  The price is ok, not too bad with the student discount.  The pomengrante lemondade was pretty good.  The food is good but it really depends on what you choose to put in the bowl.  I would come back."
JxdHtdU0uor4EPRHOdi6WA,1,"These Arepas are the best we ever had. The guy who took my wife's order was very rude and impatient, he demanded my wife tell him where she was picking up from? He kept barking at her saying Eat24!? Eat24?! Mind you we have ordered from yelp twice. And then my wife asked if she could have a dipping sauce for her fries. He yelled at her saying you didn't order fries, hand gesturing her to come here where he was standing by the resister only to find out that on the receipt we did order fries. He said you did order fries they'll be done in a min. Didn't even apologize for being a jerk. Food was fantastic but the service was a joke. Oh and there was hairs already in the styrofoam."
AnvpVgHIqf2_AXT0HlaU0g,3,"we recently went here ordered 3 dishes, the beef in enoki mushroom, garoupa pan fried and crispy chicken.  the overall taste was mediocre but especially disappointed in the crispy chicken...they gave us an unfresh chicken, the color no longer fresh and it was less than half a chicken considering the price of almost $10. I resent coming here because I had high expectation."
LjHuujQ0cca57Rdp7J5GFA,4,"Came into here not really expecting anything special in terms of a burger, but boy was I surprised! Even at 9:30pm on a Sunday this place was packed--tells you how good the food is. I had the Captain Jerk, a 6oz beef patty with grilled pineapple and jerk sauce...at $9 seemed a bit expensive, but after tasting it I would say it was worth it! The meat was very juicy, flavourful, and the pineapple really made it work. Only downside is the slow service--you can see the guys working hard in the back but there were simply so many people lined up, it took a good 20+ minutes for my order to be fulfilled."
R9IEy9nEEKLPvPHcvy6cjA,5,"I bought a new Volkswagen Routan two years ago and I have had the car in for service five times since then.  The service team has been courteous and professional and we have had no issues.  We have had oil changes, air filters replaced, tires balanced and rotated, and a rear wiper repair.  They include a free car wash each time I bring the van in for service, which is an added bonus.  

The first three years of oil changes and tire rotations are free!  Plus, when I bought the Routan, Volkswagen and Dodge had quit building them so they were selling them for $10,000 below the sticker price!  No lie!  I couldn't pass up that great deal.

We have an issue with one of the tire pressure sensors in the van so the service team ordered the new part and asked if we could bring the van back next week to install it.  I'm happy because the part and service are covered under the factory warranty.

Looking forward to several more years of good service from Ganley."
bgcL_NYy1sfxFo9hrCxLAQ,4,"After buying a few Groupons for laser removal and missing appointments and feeling rushed, I finally came into a quality spot the decor is super cute and chic. There is a brow bar where you can get threading done. I plan to try it after I grow mine out a bit. 

I popped an ibuprofen and applied numbing cream because I find laser hair removal more painful than waxing. The treatment went great and the customer service is amazing!  I can't wait to complete treatments and become hair free!  It's a pay-as-you-go place, which I like!  Btw, if you follow them on Instagram you will find major deals! That's what got me in here!

I noticed a woman leaving after her lash extensions application. Holy amazing!  I'm not in the market for these because I use Latisse, but it's great to know of a place to go if needed!"
g5VONFv41GbYM5KL1mKmKg,4,"This was the church I went to because it was the closest one to me while I was living in Chandler. It somehow felt strange to me at first because I was used to the old churches in Mexico. After going a few times, getting involved, and meeting the community, I knew this was ""home."" Now I live almost 1/2 hour away, and I still go to St. Andrew the Apostle Church.
I especially love the garden- peaceful, refreshing, and welcoming."
YTCoUwqLmGeRokaMKBmKkQ,5,"I stopped by this hospital to do a drop in tour as a prospective employee, I didn't announce who I was when I signed in; I was given a tour by a house supervisor who was very friendly & honest about the history of staff, building and services offered. I was impressed by the interactions I witnessed with pt. care and staff. I have been in this industry for 8 years and have worked for multiple companies and I can say Promise Phoenix LTAC in Mesa AZ. is very bright, friendly and attentive to pt care."
7C1S6kstzopWOk0k_0Ye9w,5,"I've been going to haunts since 1973. I've done Black Out (NYC), Knott's, Universal, etc. These are some of the best I have ever done. The effects and scare actors are excellent. I did all three. Truly scary."
S6qzqG8Xf_7TsZQJII20zg,5,"This is my favourite place in Toronto. With good food, nice and modern place and the most helpfull and king team. I always have been very well attended and very well welcome!"
TYoBgqfA4J1Bo3PrhW8eBA,4,My girlfriend and I went to Shake Shack in Vegas to see what all the hype was about and it was definitely worth the trip. We split a Shackburger and a Smokeshack. Both of the burgers were quite good especially considering it's a fast food establishment. The next time I'm around a Shake Shack I will be stopping by for some burgers and frozen custard.
dMjwDw-zaWEdCcsAjnneVQ,3,"I got this ""deal"" through Groupon for Full HVAC System Air-Duct Cleaning Plus Dryer-Vent Cleaning and A/C or furnace. for US Air Solutions (The Voucher reads: cleaning of; unlimited air vents; and dryer-vent cleaning ................... Choose between A/C or furnace unit checkup). (NOT NEEDED) 

Made the appointment and two men came to my home I notice something wrong was the 'cleaner device': It was rather small with medium sucking power. What amazed me was the fact that this machine was put in only ONE ROOM vent - the kitchen. It was there quite along time but - how can one vent - clean all vents in the house? it didn't have enough sucking power to get the 'dust' from any duct or vent.

After mentioning to them, they disregarded my opinion, saying that 'this is the way its' done. No race intended - this Hispanic gentlemen worked the whole time they were here - but on the one air duct. However, the causation man just walked around. 

He did turn the temperature for air flow. He did remove a vent or two but no cleaning - as stated in coupon. I got concerned since I did not see him doing anything. Went into the utility room and he was standing there - I asked about the dryer vent ? And he said it was done LIE. I thought how could he do it when he did not move the dryer ? -Dryer top was totally full of things. a reliable contractor returned and told me THIS WAS NOT DONE.

After getting down from the ladder - the wanderer proceeded to show me a picture on his phone of dirty ducts - and said they were mine UPSALE Furthermore, he said I needed DEEP CLEANING at a cost of $200 a duct - recently had these inspected so this was a lie - somebody else ducts in the picture

. I had the choice of a furnace or A/C inspection. I said I have a contract with an excellent service company - the wanderer - insisted he look at it - but put my foot my foot down. UPSALE - the wanderer said they had an air filter unit they could sell me. I showed him my unit and said it was the best in the business - when I purchased my unit i was given a comparison of others on the market - none of this was provided. - 

THIS BUSINESS IS NOTHING BUT A SCAM - THEY SELL GROUPON DEALS FOR LITTLE MONIES AND ARRIVE WITH NUMEROUS ITEMS AND SERVICES NOT NECESSARILY NEEDED. ALL FOR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE!

I HAVE A HOME BUSINESS SELLING COINS. I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF SHIPPING TWO COINS OUT TO SHIP ON SATURDAY. AFTER THIS CREW LEFT - THE COINS WENT MISSING ! THESE TWO WERE PLATINUM GRADED COIN PR70'S ""PERFECT"" - HAD A VALUE IN EXCESS OF $1100 TO $1200. I 

COMPLAINED TO GROUPON AND THEY SAID THEY COULD DO NOTHING. I WAS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR OVER 22 YEARS. I BELIEVED THAT I COULD READ ALMOST EVERYONE - BUT IF NOT END OF RELATIONSHIP. 

POOR SERVICE NOT AS DEFINED, TRYING TO SELL SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT NOT NEEDED - AND WORST OF ALL STEALING POSSESSIONS - OF COINS WITH A VALUE IN EXCESS OF $1100 TO $1200. 

SEEING SO MANY BAD REVIEWS ( ONE STARS) ABOUT US AIR SOLUTIONS  THIS BUSINESS GIVES OTHER BUSINESSES A BAD NAME - AND SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN ASAP!!!"
FXaRXOIUjbhwWZmZXXaP4g,2,"I order an el Jefe burrito and a grilled chicken quesadilla. My order was # 651. I took it home and found out it was a simple cheese quesadilla. I go back to the restaurant and the manager simply says sorry, throws away the quesadilla and my receipt and brings out another quesadilla with chicken. It is with the shredded chicken that is dry and something I do not like and did not want.  So I drive twice to espos only to be extremely disappointed in the customer service and the unwillingness to solve my problem. Unfortunately, this has left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be back for quite sometime."
022IgbNnxoXqMtvGZq6itw,5,There is a warm and fuzzy feeling about this school that you don't get at at a lot of other schools. Every time I walked into my sons class I could tell it is a caring and stimulating environment filled with happy two years olds. The best part are the teachers. They TRULY care about the kids. Choosing the right school for your child is not easy but I hope this makes it a little less difficult. Whiz Kidz is an AMAZING school.
j4YwwckH57bw0spbhuG3_A,5,Great service! Great atmosphere! Even better food. Everything we had was top notch. The beef tenderloin I had was perfect. One of the better cuts of meat I've ever had! We will return
F31yLhBBGvGxAGs2RVNZvA,5,"I have not stayed here, so I can't comment on the service. I've only walked through the hotel, but I think I am in love... Five stars for a beautiful environment!

I love all the design details -- dark woods, clean lines, the elegant mixture of different textiles and materials. Each of the different restaurants, shops and lounges have their own feeling but are very much a part of the whole. Even the public restrooms were a delight!

I want to stay here... Maybe next time..."
qYNMH8H--g5cBTdP6cD7FA,5,"We were traveling across country and had an encounter with a snow bank and our alignment on front tires was off and were not sure if we could make it back to Los Angeles or not. We came in first thing on Sunday morning  on our way through and they were able to evaluate and fix the situation immediately and we were on our way. Wonderful honest, friendly and efficient service."

bfU1YclIcAXY7cASNxeNHw,5,"We love Dr. Ross Lirtzman and his staff. Four years ago he took at 15 pound Lipoma out of husky Francis. We had to see him ago this past month for are other dog who tore an ACL. He gave us the best advice. He was not there for the money, but there for our dog best interest. I can not say enough about the man and his staff. Its hard to leave Arizona and move to California when the best vet lives here."
pU6VeTI5qyCy7Ir0VJpLxw,5,I have come here for a number of years and have actually purchased art here.  Every visit I have found all the artists to be forth coming with information about their work.   Today I was fascinated with the work of Adolfo Girala.  His swimming dish with the one going his own way was truly amazing.
Y6iCCLdu8vcWocsvWlKisw,4,"My friend, in her desire to bust my lobster cherry (I know, I know!), took me to the Fish House. Kind of a lame name, but I pushed on.

The restaurant makes no attempt to hide that it's a seafood restaurant. Fish...everywhere! At first, the fish smell was pretty strong upon entry, which turned me off a little. Luckily, the smell was long gone by the time we got to where we were seated.

The prices are very reasonable, the server was very friendly, and the dining area was definitely a lot nicer than what I was expecting. I ordered the angel hair pasta, with lobster, shrimp, and scallops.

The bowl was huge, and very appealing. The food itself was downright delicious, and I could definitely see why lobster is held in such high regard. Despite my best efforts, I could only finish just over half of it. No matter, it was just as delicious reheated for lunch the next day!

Well done, Fish House. Now you guys just have to work on changing your name to something that doesn't resemble an insult one would hurl at a lousy strip joint."
Uz9inmPeq4kJKQfIcTJhSg,5,"Annalysa was very nice and helpful for us! Made great suggestions ... and did her thing. When i go back , i will definitely ask to be seated in her section!"
n8xlOG7Dqkf53s6Vj_DO4w,5,This place is amazing. The crepes...fantastic (and I am a French snob). The octopus...made perfectly. Can't beat the bottomless mimosas for $10 at brunch either. I will definitely be coming back. We are very new to the area and excited to find such a great place.
GKt-B_PYlGu22aCzLn6-Iw,5,"My daughter took me to Sephora to see about a makeover. After waiting 20 minutes to talk to  someone,  I asked the girl smiling, before I schedule an appointment  will you be able to cover some wrinkles and my old spots? She responded, ""No I can't"". Needless to say,  I walked out and scheduled  an appointment with MAC In Dillards.  They did a Beautiful  job! and coverage was amazing . Sephora  is overated!"
uFKNfiN0ifzGY5HhvR4Blw,3,"This place has an average of three and a half stars? Really? We ordered a veggie pizza the other night and it was pretty dreadful -- soggy, bland and way overloaded with black olives. The side salads were fresh enough, but the ""house"" Italian dressing lacked character. The delivery guy was friendly, and our orders arrived quickly, so I'm giving Teresa's an extra star. Woohoo."
f1VUmSHySRItFbUf1kxnHw,4,"As an employee at In-N-Out, I thought that nothing would compare to my usually Double-Double. However, Habit Burger has changed the game. When I first walked in, I noticed that the restaurant was very open so I could see everything going on in the back. The onion rings were fantastic, and the bacon on the BBQ Bacon Char Burger was extraordinary. Another positive for me was the great music choice. I don't know what station it was but they were playing great throwbacks. Overall, it was a fantastic experience."
IsI7uXHYfty5AuJIc9Vnwg,4,"As part of my team's Friday lunch outing, we came here. There were five of us. My manager drove over here from his home after taking a series of conference calls in the morning. I drove my colleagues over to this restaurant.

It's located in a plaza where there are a bunch of eateries. There is also a DriveTest office, which makes me cringe to be entering a parking lot full of worried wannabe licensed drivers.

We went in and were immediately greeted by a number of Chinese folks. It is a cheerful Cantonese-speaking group.

I ordered the chicken bowl, which consists of rice and beans, and any fresh toppings that you desire. Naturally, I needed corn, but also added other goodies. I went with the chipotle sauce. It has a slight kick to it. I also ordered a cream soda.

If you want guacamole, it is an extra $2. The place also sells beer. Seating is limited.

Since were were the largest group there, our meals were brought to us. It was a nice touch.

I enjoyed my chicken bowl. All ingredients were fresh and tasty.

Our group was mixed as far as opinions go. My manager and another colleague weren't impressed. They have been to a number of burrito places and probably have higher expectations than the rest of us. The rest of us found our meals to be tasty.

This place has a card stamp program. If you order ten times, your next order is free. I will need to look at my card more carefully, as I have yet to read the fine print. I will definitely come back here and figure it out.

svoT9UWAO4cCYqu1VWatmQ,3,Food is amazing but interesting how we ordered beverages and it takes them over 40 min to bring our sodas.. rice is still cooking in the back where 3 out 9 people in our party were given rice..then we ordered soup but they're out of spoons. The food was good but everything just took way too long.

55V3KN4MyCV4RPe89FFkSg,4,"Need fancy intimate decor and ambiance?  Not here... instead you'll get polite service and pretty darn good food.  Don't let the interior (or exterior) discourage you.  Having absolutely no experience with Peruvian cuisine I had not idea what the carapulcra would be.  It was definitely a different take on 'stew', but it was delicious and they even stack your rice into the shapes of temples.

MMa8aB4d4dlIG6BzpT6vVA,2,"Pros: semi clean, although I saw her wash the pedi bowl when i was finished and there was no deep clean or thoroughness involved whatsoever

Cons: pedi took a mere 25 minutes and was very rushed for the steep price of $33, which meant  poor job on on shaping of nails, cleaning/cuticles, and massage; paint job was just OK, I could have done the same myself

Overall: after tip I spent $39 and this was absolutely not worth almost $40. I will not return for the poor quality and service"
Lbjtnev-NANviE2lqMRlRA,4,"Leoné is great for a quick coffee break or a relaxed Sunday brunch. Underground parking escalator and lift are located right at the side entrance, which is super convenient if you're not feeling like window shopping in Tivoli.

Their dessert case is usually stocked with everything from cheesecakes to chocolate truffles, so make sure to check out what they have for the day. I usually opt for something savory when it comes to breakfast and have yet to be disappointed by their omelettes, which are easily customizable. Also guilty of ordering the California Turkey Sandwich with extra romaine / without bread on multiple occasions without any trouble. 

Service is relatively friendly and attentive, especially the waitstaff and bussers. Will continue to drop by!"
alNFJB9X3wWPRsAZGjmAsA,4,If you are looking for a place with good ambience then this is not the right one. However the food was delicious and the service was quick. Would definitely go back again to try more items.
-sdrLKY9-NXKN0ucJCoobw,4,"Just sampled some Naaco Truck at the YYC Food Truck Fest at the Riverwalk and I am happy to report that it was delicious. Worth the 20 minute wait in the sun, with the Virgin mobile tent blasting the latest whatever in my ear, especially when they called my name and I opened the brown Naaco box to reveal chickpea fritters wrapped in a gluten free pita and a generous helping of mogo chips (cassava chips, I think?). I dusted some citrus salt on there and dug in. It was filling without being heavy, the fritters were crunchy on the outside, soft inside and the toppings were really fresh. They were out of iced tea but we did get a s'moresa for dessert, a samosa filled with callebaut chocolate and chai spice, which was delicious, covering our faces with powered sugar. 
All in all, some great truck food at a good price. In the growing sea of food trucks in yyc, Naaco is a real stand out."

NXZA3cyo7fZSg0r1zJscWg,4,"Pretty darn good, but the claim to be the best burger in town may be a tad overstated. The burger was a bit greasy, but the service was awesome, fries were great, I will definitely be back, but I can't say it is the best by any stretch."

My carpets look amazing
I would highly recommend HydroCare Services for carpet cleaning in phoenix 
I will use them again!!
Thank you Michel&Joe"
MVvIuLN_ZkcRv8tsZdNWfA,4,"Food was good. I had rolled tacos filled with potatoes.  I felt like it needed more seasoning on the potato though.  Their sauces are amazing and made up for the lack of seasoning. Rice and beans good, standard fair. The place was busy which is a statement in itself and I don't know how new it is but I'm guessing pretty new. Some things we wanted to order we were told they didn't have yet even though it was on the menu board and the regular menu sheets.  They definitely need some window shades.  We had to sit in the sun and were just melting from the heat. All in all I recommend this place and will take food to go so I can add my own seasoning and not sit in an oven."
USy_kdlkLcd50xyXy0oI8Q,3,Was much better under the old owners. Many of the staff have changed since the owners sold this location to open up another location. The guy who takes your money at the cash is not at all friendly. Doesn't ask how your meal was or anything. I think he's one of the new owners. The use of iPads to take your order is ridiculous and takes too long. Much prefer going to Friends or Wally's on  Steeles now.

Fb-OT_Trm9qnD2jYOGZy_w,5,"I love this shop! They always have great flavors, and use quality ingredients. Also, I've never been to a shop with better customer service than RRV. They go above and beyond to satisfy their customers; even accommodating them if the customer makes a mistake in ordering.

I've been buying from RRV since 2014, and I've never felt let down. Awesome, awesome shop! Will continue to be a satisfied customer for years to come."
v-mb1UaeUxTVj-oGSDfePg,2,"These guys made an appointment, and gave a rough estimate to pump my septic. They called to change the appointment after running late, and gave us a new time. They were late again, and showed up near the end of the day.

After looking for the tank, he said he would need the camera that was on the other truck. Since the work day would be over when he got back it would be $150 an hour for overtime. If we wanted them to come back Monday (it was Friday ) then there was no charge for the looking they had done. If not, it was $90.

I called the office to try and figure out why I was going to have to let my drains keep backing up, or pay $150 an hour, when the issue was the guys were horribly late and didn't bring their tools. The guy in the office was nice, but unhelpful. He described it as a unique situation with stuff under the ground in the yard making it hard to find my tank, and suggested I get someone with a backhoe.

I had someone else come out with a metal poker and a tape measure and mark the tank off in less than half an hour, and charge me $25."
0C-izktkLGyTz8CJCDA6Ag,5,"This is a true pottery studio, the employees are so knowledgeable and friendly. Love learning the wheel, this was my first experience and I will for sure be returning.

Highly recommend this studio if your looking to learn how to create beautiful pottery."

Thank you so much for getting my hair done enjoyable again"

Driver came and tried to call me instead of buzzing in the lobby, when i didn't answer my cell phone he left. I called back after the 40 Min and they apologized and sent him back out.. they told me I still had to pay because I didn't answer my phone. Frustrated but hungry I agreed. The driver took over 1 hour to return with a cold pizza, i told him I'm not paying for that and called the hotline. . After an argument with the lady because I agreed to pay to re-send it and now waiting over 2 hours i had them take it back ....

c3KqtDhaGe-_HVcrFnTyGg,3,"Good, but not great...

Sloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.

We all had salads for our first course:
 - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.
 - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.
 - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.
 - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.

As for mains:
 - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.
 - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.
 - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.
 - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.

Sides:
 - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!
 - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)
 - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.

Desserts:
 - Ice cream - not much to say about that
 - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich
 - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.

For the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.

All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

All-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service."
t0ohwLsy2ri4nr79on5yOw,2,"As new Scottsdale residents we have been trying a number of places near our house and while my parents were visiting we decided to give Village Tavern a try after a neighbor talked about it.

Well, I wish we hadn't.  The food was tasteless and bland.  I should have known right away we were in trouble when I saw how large the menu was.  It is all over the board with fried fish and flat bread pizza to street tacos.  

My wife had the spaghetti squash & zucchini.  She said it was terrible.  I had the cowboy burger and was not impressed at all.  The onion ribbons were cold and the bun was not very fresh.  Overall, just not very good at all.  

There are much better places to eat right in the same retail center."
3rLq9SBtQ20En4JYdvs1XQ,5,"Fried Green tomatoes with mozzarella and balsamic.
Cajun shrimp and grits.
And a Sazarac. 
Best southern fare in Pittsburgh area.  I'll be back.
Wait staff on Point. 
Totally worth the money and the drive to Moon."
hCH4ivW_JlaLlJn0xYcLjg,5,"This place has a great Happy Hour menu with good food and prices! The Teriyaki beef ribs are a must try, very tender. 

Service is always quick and friendly. We've visited with our family 3 times and will continue to come back."
HCPa1bgx5KnytzC8qcQzng,5,"I went here because of all the great photos on Yelp, and I was NOT disappointed.  My husband and I both ordered the pork carnitas fajitas.  I don't know if I can order anything else, they were so good.  The chips came out with a smoky and hot salsa.  The fajitas came out sizzling.  There were green and red peppers, onions and mushrooms with the perfectly cooked pork.  Oh my, this skinny girl ate a lot!  I can't wait to go back.  

I am thrilled as I don't like the cheesy Sonoran fare served at most Mexican restaurants around town."
A1s7_moYOANhCoCIb7ZhGQ,5,I don't know why these guys get such bad reviews. Finding a plumber in Prescott that won't gouge you is impossible. These guys drive up from Chandler. Thanks Matt for the excellent work. Office staff very courteous. Thanks America Home Shield for sending them out.
YDGIqBVV6jZpk2pTE0BdFA,4,"Very standard Wendys. 

Nothing special but the staff was excellent !! From handling a very large crowd of customers too also serving our food quickly and fresh ! Other then that, its pretty standard Wendy's lol"
EMa_KRTt27aGoP-WCBdPqw,4,"WOW! We were so impressed with this place - we had 3 young kids with us, and it wasn't a problem, the atmosphere was noisy enough that we didn't feel conspicuous with our kiddos making noise, but it was adult-friendly too, with a great looking bar/beer list. The food was OUTSTANDING! Burger might be the best I've had in years - the bun was to die for. We all shared a milkshake at the end of the meal and it was delicious...and the kids of course loved it :-)  Kids menu is small but totally fine, and the regular menu is great. We had a BLT (which was MASSIVE), the Chicken melt sandwich with mushrooms, which was served on garlic bread and perfectly cooked - nice, thin chicken, not hard to bite into or eat - sandwich didn't fall apart once you bit into it, and the regular cheeseburger was the star of the meal - just fabulous. French fries were like old fashioned carnival fries (wish they would have offered vinegar, actually) - and the onion rings were probably our least favorite of the whole meal, they were a little bit greasy for our taste. Overall, this was a great experience, we are sure to be back with our family again!"
durDLEN4XxsRXJMsGbC0bg,4,"Always passed by when going to Boulder City, finally stopped by.  Loved the Mexican decor.  Ordered Chicken enchillada, sauce was little salty otherwise was cheesy and delicious.  Beef and cheese burrito with sauce on side, husband loved it.  Nice atmosphere.  Waitresses very nice."
vuXm21wCUEg0lA0CH6WWTg,4,"Forget Little Caesar's (if you already didn't).  Forget Hungry Howie's.
Go to Big Jimmy's if you want a five dollar pizza.
Coming back from a bar on the light rail, my boyfriend and I noticed the ""$5 PIZZA!"" sign hanging in front of this restaurant.  I was drunk and had the munchies hardcore, so we decided to get off the train and walk over.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  It was a cheap hole in the wall pizza place, right next to Food City.
Surprisingly, I found the pizza to be pretty frickin' delicious!  The sausage had wonderful flavor, the cheese seemed like REAL cheese (unlike that weird yellowish stuff on Little Caesars pizza ;] ) and there was just the right amount of tasty sauce.  The free seasoned crust was better than Hungry Howie's.   Actually, the entire pizza was better than a Hungry Howie's Pizza.  And we all know where Little Caesar's sits on the totem pole, so of course it was better than any Little Caesar's pizza also.
""Am I just drunk or is this actually really good?""  I asked my boyfriend at one point.  He replied, ""no, this is actually pretty damn good.""  I had my suspicions, however. I recall one drunken night, I even found Gus's Pizza to be tasty.  I know, I know.  I had a lot to drink that night...
The next morning my suspicions were cleared.  We heated up the leftovers and ate them and the pizza was still super tasty.
I have been back several times since, and have been itching to try their other menu items such as the wings and sandwiches.  This is the best place by ASU campus to get $5 pizza.  Actually, since I discovered it, I haven't ordered pizza from ANYWHERE else, so I can actually say this is one of the best places to get pizza in the Tempe area."

There were a lot of things to look at in the waiting area, plus you can watch people shoot off the 50cal. The girls at the desk were really helpful. Our 'instructor' was Zach. He was super sweet and did not rush us at all. 

*MUST*: You HAVE to shoot the 50cal while you're there!!! What an experience!"
W8dVhuk3gHKRNuG5ApTZRA,5,Great customer service. Best eyebrow and face threading.  Also the facials and massage are incredible.  I had my hair cut today and I love it. This is definitely my one stop for everything beauty. I highly recommend this place.  Patrick does amazing work.

It's a good location for any of the theater venues in Downtown Pittsburgh.  The underground parking garage is very convenient and they have validated free parking after 5:00pm.  Their Platinum Club is well worth joining!"

zFssbijX_9vhWitOrWL7QQ,4,"They do not have as many succulents as shown on this yelp profile or their Instagram, but the nursery is very cute. Some of their indoor plant prices are high but they have a selection that I do not see at other plant nurseries. The associate was very nice and friendly, and so was the gentlemen that was located inside the indoor plant area/ frog area. Really there are no complaints. I will definitely be back to purchase again :0)"

UFVQEK9nhG1dSY0xJVCkCw,5,"When told I would be visiting Airdrie for a week on business, my hopes were not high for finding a good place to have a decent wine and a good dinner. But I was happily proven quite wrong! Peppercorns, a jewel of a restaurant tucked on a busy corner and backing onto a peaceful lagoon, was the discovery of the year! When traveling as a single woman and asking for a 'table for one', I often feel a distinct chlll from the server or from the maître'd, as if  wondering if it's even worth their time to wait on this poor lonely waif.  This was not the case at Peppercorns. I was welcomed and offered a premier table overlooking the  water.  Once I ordered wine, the mood of the  server improved and the rest of the evening was a delight.  A fine Caesar salad began the courses and it was as fresh as I have ever had.  I couldn't resist the 'Braised Angus Short  ribs in Guinness Stout' and I did not regret my choice!  Succulent, tender, flavorful and accented with silky mashed potatoes and fresh baby vegetables, this was a dish that I will not soon forget!  Amazingly, I was offered a 'complementary' dessert at meal's end.  How good can it be, I thought?  But the maple flavored chocolate cake that arrived provided the perfect meal's end and if I weren't such a lady, would have prompted a good plate-licking.  At the close of the evening, the gracious restaurant owner (who had been on the floor all evening pouring water, changing linens) thanked me for my business. You are most welcome, Kind Lady, and  rest assured, I shall make every effort to return!"
hIvOwyfCEMfsakeINAP0Dw,4,"This is really a 4.5. Great, fast service. Only problem is it's always pretty busy (which is actually a good sign) and you probably won't be able to bring in your car on the same day you call.  I got charged for a full hour of labour for something that shouldn't have taken more than 15 minutes. Brought in my SUV to have two stripped screws removed so I could change a part myself. When I came back the part was changed and everything worked perfectly, but I never asked to have the part changed.  I left the part In the trunk so it was definitely a miscommunication. Hence the 5 stars. Owner is very friendly, and honestly I will be taking my car back there instead of the ford dealer."
_DM-Ssh0QjrgU7RC_idEhQ,3,"Applebee's. That's about what I can say for the food. You get decent chain restaurant food here. The main reason I am reviewing them is they have a late night happy hour in the bar area from 10pm to close. There actually aren't a ton of choices to get some food after 9 or 10pm in Las Vegas. So if you are hungry late night, drop in, the bar staff is usually great!!"

Sat in the drive thru for 5 minutes before I decided to pull around.  Did some work in my car, and waited until they opened at 6 and went inside.  The lobby was filthy, as was behind the registers.  Still no one at the counter, and had to wait.  The drink station was a mess, and the closest table looked like someone had rubbed feces  on it.  Nicole was polite, but not very personable.  She acted like I was interrupting her morning with her cell phone in her shirt pocket.  Not sure why I keep coming back here"

Stop in and enjoy the ambience and hospitality."

So...I will admit walking in and for there to be no customers and only seeing 1 guy working made me think twice if I just made a mistake. I was immediately greeted and when I asked what was good he was honest. Got a Philly cheesesteak...he added all my requested fixins. I got wedding soup as well. I was staying at the local hotel and walked my food back. My soup was very hot and for being late in the evening it wasn't too salty and tasted great. I didn't feel like I got the last of the pot...great surprise. My sandwich was hot and delish.  The bread was fresh not stale...again it was late and you can always tell you got day old bread...not here. Sandwich was dressed like requested. Service was quick and he was kind. Plus, he packed my items up nicely. Definitely will be back!"

CBvTtDkWZLjB7aiSiNfmbw,5,"Whenever I have family in town, I like to treat them to a different show. They love it, and usually I pick shows I have yet to see.

I decided to take my Mom and Aunt who were in town celebrating my Mom's Birthday.
First off, this is probably not the right show to take YOUR mom to! It is filthy, crude, and frequently offensive. With that said, my Mom who is a real character loved it. Even if she did describe it as ""very interesting"" in a finger quotes kind of why, I know she had a blast!

The show is in a small tent, in front of the Caesars Hotel. I went down to the box office directly to ask for a ""locals discount"" and saved some $$! There is not a bad seat i the house, but they are close together, for sure. Which actually added to the show, we were chatting with the people around us before it started. 

I loved it! I laughed, clapped, and was in awe of the talent.
There was an amazing over-the-top simplicity to the show that was both intimate and incredible to see. Definitely one to get tickets for!!"

RwZJ7mHHE_EiToEAFKz9Kw,3,"I've had a take out menu on my fridge for this place for two years at least but I never ordered from them because I'm lazy and I generally only order from a place if I can order online.  Anything to avoid that whole talking-to-a-real-person thing.

Anytime I try a new Chinese place I order all of my favorites at once just so I know if it's worth a second time around.

There were some highs and lows and in-betweens.

1. Wonton Egg Drop Soup - Nothing on any Chinese menu will ever be better than putting the two best soups in the world together.... unless you get it from Gold Chef.  I'm glad I only ordered the small because I didn't even finish that.  The wontons were fine, but the broth was so bland.  It was basically just egg water... I want you to sit and think about what egg water might taste like... you got a lock down in your mind on that? That's right.  Egg water.  It was really, really horrible.  Zero stars for the soup.

2.  Crab Puffs - These were fine.  Not any detectable crab, but they weren't over sweet like so many tend to be.  I would order these again.  

3.  Egg Rolls - A few people mentioned that there is no meat in these, but there most certainly was a noticeable amount of pork in mine.  So please, if you are a vegetarian or do not eat pork, this is NOT something you want to order.  Do not listen to the other reviews who say it's all vegetable.  That all being said, they are tasty.  Sufficiently crispy and flavorful with a good ratio of wrapper to filling.

4. Lemon Chicken - The chicken is breaded, not battered, which is a plus in my book.  The lemon sauce was also probably the best lemon sauce I've ever had.  I'm not sure everyone would agree, though.  It's very sweet and tastes almost like a lemon glaze for pies rather than something for a savory dish, but I thought it tasted awesome with the chicken.  This is gonna be a judgment call on if you think you'd like a sweeter sauce.  The chicken itself wasn't as dry as the breaded chicken tends to be in other places, so that was a bonus as well.

5. Singapore Mei Fun - No one ever has and probably ever will beat the PF Changs version of this dish (Singapore Street Noodles) but this one was decent.  The chicken and pork seemed a little dry and not very fresh, but the flavor was fine and the shrimp was cooked well.  I might have liked it just a touch spicier though.

Overall, everything was very good, but I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 star rating because the soup was just THAT BAD.  The only way I'd order again is if I had a craving for something specific and didn't really want soup.  Sadly, I usually only order Chinese food when I have a soup craving specifically.  Such a shame that the most important component for me was the one horrible thing I got."
0LfTYKiuvPUYNxOlClPzpw,3,It's like going way back in time. I felt at home because it reminded me of Italian restaurants growing up in the 70s back in NY. To be very honest the food was just okay but definitely nothing exciting. It's the atmosphere that truly makes it. The sad part is that the original owner has retired and Its now owned by a large corporation.
PbJDSh09A-VMWW1KNbHahA,3,"Well. Yes, it is a good deal for Vegas, this close to the strip. You get what you pay for, really. This is an old property. Prior to the renovation that was completed in 2013, it was pretty bad. Horrible beds, old carpet, furniture, etc...   The local clientele that frequents the place is a bit sketchy. We witness a stabbing one evening in Marilyn's Cafe. Most of the clientele, however is from out of town, but at these rates, you can imagine some of the people that stay there. My company has an annual conference there, so I don't really have a choice. The Italian restaurant downstairs, isn't bad and Marilyn's isn't bad for breakfast.  The bellmen are exceptional though. Ask for Frank... he'll take care of you. Thanks Frank!"

bvUl6HhnTkgfC2P5SrhXJQ,4,"Q1 Le Pho is one of those Chinese owned and managed Vietnamese restaurants. The menu and taste profile is really similar to Le Viet and Lemongrass. 

Nicely decorated and spacious. Good for groups as there are a couple of bigger round tables.

Since I came after lunch rush so no issue with wait time or services.

Portion wise is good for the price. As long as you don't expect authentic Vietnamese food, you will be quite happy. My regular size  Pho Bo Hue is filling enough and I left satisfied.

MSG alert if you prefer less MSG. I was thirsty after lunch."
nVeOww7zDuQH8KYeCEQ59w,5,"This may have been my first fine dining experience and it was phenomenal.  Memorable in every way!!!

To start, the place looks amazing.  It looks like, you know, a circus... tent and all! 

The service was amazing.  Again, my first fine dining experience so I had never experienced having multiple waiters tend to our every needs. The food presentation was stellar and I especially liked the fact that each serving was brought by a single waiter who, while carefully placing it in front of us, would whisper in our ear a description of what we were about to enjoy.  

Every bite was enjoyable and the desserts were just as good.  We ordered a bottle of wine and simply enjoyed a stellar meal.  My wife will tell you that one of the highlights was when they brought her a purse holder clip with ""Le Cirque"" written in rhinestones... of course her favorite part of the story is when they gifted it to her at the end of the meal.  She uses it everywhere we go now.

Can't wait to go back!!!"
N6j1SD7URvsG9eHPJGVrOg,5,5 stars for having vegan pizza!! it's really good!! The dough is lovely as well as the veggies and the service was wonderful and friendly. We will be back.

It's always nice to have new experience...I like this place!"
YUFqVikANsrHCA6mvf59Lw,4,"I admit, as a vegetarian, I had my reservations about eating at The Grind in Phoenix. After all, the bar and restaurant's logo is a meat grinder, which is just plain sad.

But, my friend insisted it was a cool-looking spot and had tasty food, including veggie options, so I gave the Arcadia neighborhood restaurant a whirl and was pleased with my meal there.

Upon walking in, I was immediately impressed by the long, dark bar lit up by red lights. There's no host, but a bartender will direct you where to sit-at the bar, or in one of the comfy booths facing the bar. The restaurant is one long rectangle, which makes every seat in the house an intimate one because you don't have to hear chatter from other parties. The bar features sports televisions, and it's a hip place for casual occasions.

The menu, not surprisingly, is full of meat dishes, including hamburgers, a chicken wrap and a turkey burger. I opted for the grilled portobello sandwich ($10), which came with fried zucchini, ricotta salata and watercress. It was a massive burger and tasted great.

I added a side of mac and cheese ($6), which also tasted great but wasn't anything spectacular.


My pal got the equally massive peppercorn burger ($10), topped with charred onion, watercress and matchstick potatoes.

I shared his tasty fries ($4) with him.

While I thought The Grind was a little pricy, especially because burgers don't come with sides and my meal totaled $16, I think the atmosphere is sleek and trendy and worth it if you really want a nice burger place. Plus, the staff, including our bartender and server, was incredibly friendly. I left feeling stuffed and happy and would go back-I would just love if they offered another veggie burger."
acHYATwsrU3BbMzADgwMnQ,1,"Je n'emmènerais pas une première ""date"" au Club Sandwich c'est certain mais quand il est rendu 3 heures du matin et que j'ai virée un bonne brosse, disons que c'est comme un p'tit paradis de la poutine et du junk food. Ouvert 24 heures sur 24 et 7 jours sur 7, on ne se trompe jamais à savoir si quelqu'un sera là pour donner un bon fond aux estomacs qui ont peut-être abusé un peu trop lors d'une soirée aux proportions épiques! Le jour, je n'y suis jamais allée, mais très tard le soir, j'ai même fait un détour en taxi pour m'assurer d'y aller et manger quelque chose de solide avant d'aller me coucher."

And, most importantly, my hair looked great and stayed that way on a very humid day.
I will be returning everytime I have a chance to get back home."
EYP_u1bvS5sAUPoEkMna-w,4,"I'm going to slow the hype train on Trader Joe's for a bit. The produce, seafood, and the meats are pretty gross compared to what you find at Metcalfe's or Whole Foods. (Not to be a wet blanket, but frozen ""organic"" chicken breasts preserved in some ""special"" preservative doesn't inspire confidence.)
Trader Joe's is best for stuff like nuts and raisins. People I know have also recommend fruit juices, which I don't drink because I'm trying to limit sugar, and also liquor, but I don't drink so I can't speak to that.
Layout of the store is great with plentiful underground parking!"

On a lark we ordered a pulled pork sandwich because how could we only order an appetizer?  Also amazing btw!

LorXg3lyRM9bDBwBP_In9g,3,"Stopped in for fuel and a few snacks after having breakfast up the street.
We came in here purely for convenience, easy in easy out, we were travelling east on Sahara so anything on the right hand side of the road worked.
The fuel prices here is what really got me fired up. I can tell the difference between premium fuel and regular in my particular vehicle so I normally run premium. At this station premium was $.50 more per gallon than regular!! I've never seen such a huge difference between the lowest grade and highest, that's crazy! I opted for the lowest grade and just dealt with a lower performing engine for that tank of fuel. $.20-.30 difference is the norm.
The store was clean and the clerk friendly. Just don't come here if you buy premium grade fuel."
ZFgrjBwxzK952enoSglHpw,1,"I was excited to book this company based on the reviews. I submitted a request and was contacted via email stating that date was available.  Within a few days I received a contract and paid my deposit. The next day I received an email stating that they had double booked and they were issuing  a refund - they did apologized and offer to refer me to a similar vendor.  I was bummed but I understand mistakes happen. so I was ok since they were trying to make it right. 
However I never heard back from them or received a call.  My suggestion is have a backup plan in case they cancel and you never hear back from them."
K_QlH6iBjXrFcS22MBYaTw,3,Not too bad. Paid 16 for two meals. Fried rice and chow mein with one chicken each. Panda Express has better prices and might even taste better. But if you're really hungry and in the area it's not toooo bad.

OSZ4bDaOaaDABrF3A2JT-w,5,My group stayed here from may 17-21 and we loved the hotel. Check in is at 3pm but we got to check in at 1:30pm. For all four days the total was $719.81and the resort fee was around $100. If you don't ruin the room you stayed in they give you the money back. There's tons of slot machines to play here and they have a huge bar. They also have a 24 hour McDonald's and it's always busy. They also have a coffee place here that opens at 6am and closes at 5pm. The staff here is friendly and helpful. This hotel is only a ten minute walk to the edc shuttle on 9th street.

LrBenCFqb7wqHK09H1kKWw,4,"So I went on a field trip today to the St. Lawrence, and my prof allowed us to eat at the St. Lawrence Market for lunch, a place I have not visited for 14 years. Sure enough, after an admirable experience with Buster's Sea Cove during the VELD Music Festival, I decided to go there again, especially after hearing great reviews.

I decided to get the grilled octopus after pressuring and recommendation from one of the employees. It came with either fries or salad (I went with caesar salad). I got about four BIG pieces of octopus on top of the caesar salad.

Portion wise I was definitely happy considering I paid a total of just over $18 with a drink, as I initially thought it would be a bit of a ripoff. In fact, I didn't even finish the salad, that's how filling it was. The octopus was definitely one of the best ones I've had ever, and it didn't even need to be fried, since fried stuff is usually tastier.

Will I come back? Oh hell yes, next time I'm in the area."
CXY6wem3tPc5rezopjwiEw,1,"I had  to write a review for pizza hut, this place I give not even a star
Me and my bob were craving some late night snack, so we decided to do pizza hut. My bob was wanting there buffalo wings, they looked so good on ther website. So we ordered some. Only$ 6.99 for 8 piece which is not bad,(plus the delivery fee is$ 3.50) so we just got those. 
I called them up and they guy picked up the phone, his name was jo, he sounded he wasn't even on earth when I was talking to him, I had to keep on repeating my order. Finally about the 3rd time I told him my order he said it will be here about 35 to 40 min. I thought it was kinda long for wings but I said ok. 
55 min later, I still haven't heard anything so I called Jo up again and I asked, what is keeping our order, he said wait just a little bit longer, it should be there, wait another 15 min, if he is not there, call us back. So I said ok, waited for actually 20 min, still nothing, so I called him back, I kept my cool and I asked what is going on, he said what is the address again I told him again, than he handed the phone to his manager, I talked to her and she told us that they called us couple times to let us know that we were at the house couple of times for our wings, I stood right by our door the whole time I didn't get any knock or anything. She got a  little bit pissy at me and said well, we will make a new batch, except us in 5 min, I said ok, I walked outside with my computer and waited, they were here in less that 4 min when I got off the phone.
The delivery guy told us he was sorry about all the trouble. Than he started asking us all kinds of questions about our living situation which was not perfectionall at all. 
I didn't really answer him, he was nice though. 
As I walked in the house and looked at the order, it was the wrong order, he they gave us boneless buffalo wings. I went threw all that for them to give me the wrong order, I will NOT be ordering from this pizza hut again, they are others around our area that I will try. I wish you luck at this pizza hut. 

But at the end I just learned to put on a happy face and just the enjoy the wrong order we got, the buffalo boneless was not bad, (there sauce was watery but good). was the same price."

Ok, we finally get seated, didn't have to wait long but no waitress to take drink or food orders. We had to flag a poor waitress down to get noticed. My wife got the shrimp with Mango Habanero sauce. She loved the sauce! Daughter got the mozarella sticks with ranch. I got the boneless wings with spicey garlic sauce. The wings were good just on the little large size. Good ambience and alot of sports action going on (March Madness, NBA, etc). Too many of the same tvs showing the same college basketball game but overall ok."

Well, as luck would have it, a friend arranged a girl's dinner at Luciano's one evening and to my surprise(!), the dark, dank, old space that used to be home to La Paz was beautifully transformed - and BONUS, the food is off the chain!  A must try: the beef carpaccio.  It is the best I have ever had.  Ever.  I don't know what it is, maybe the crunchy little capers or the truffle oil (probably both), but dang... it's THAT good.  Plus, the service is attentive and balanced...the right amount of ""5-star"" without feeling like a fool if you accidentally use the wrong utensils.  I've since visited several times and have always enjoyed - thoroughly enjoyed - the meal & the experience.  And I must add, half price bottles of wine on Wednesday's.

Ever since they opened, I will stop in a a few times a week for  breakfast or lunch at the Juice Box. I usually get the Green Machine smoothie. It's made with spinach, kale, lemons, pineapple, banana, and coconut milk. It fills me up and gives me a great boost of energy.

My glass of sweet tea was never empty. My craving for hush puppies was met with an offer of some more. Yes, please!

Good food, served fast, from helpful and friendly people. Yellow checkered table cloths, wood paneled walls, ancient light fixtures that look like they belong in my momma's home. This is what the South is all about. At least, it should be."

I had the tamales with green sauce, which was good (not amazing, but good). The enchiladas were fantastic and their drinks are amazing. We had several different margaritas, one with pomegranate, the other with jalapenos. Fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone with kids or for family outings. Free parking in the area and a very laid back, relaxed environment. We can't thank the bartender enough for his amazing help and great recommendations."

I have never ordered food here, but you must order two beverages (either alcoholic or non-alcoholic).  The drinks are actually delivered quite fast for such a large audience of people.  The efficiency is great here."
Du8IUle8_6G-IQxTifgLAw,5,"I lost the vision in my right eye when I was 17 years old, 22 years ago.  Since that time I've seen several Ocularists and certainly Eric Lindsey is the best.  The fit is great and pain free, the material used stays polished longer than other shells I've had which in turn lead to a more realistic looking shell and a greater level of comfort, and lastly Eric's supreme artistic talent really comes through with the lifelike appearance of the shell.  I've personally recommended several people to Eric and if you're looking for an Ocularist I would recommend him to you too."

I do love the restaurants here.  Almost all of the places on my to do list were here...  BOA, Spago, etc

-1 star for that freaky show.  The children in the audience looked terrified.  It was odd scary pop up animated creatures with deep recorded voices."
Fkm9asoPo2zqk7M4FfCEWg,5,This is probably my favorite milk tea shop on campus! My favorite drink is the peach oolong milk tea. There's so much selection and I highly recommend their braised pork rice. Come early though since it's first come first serve and they always seem to sell out.
MlsqR6uMlV64cyLv5Fpj8w,3,"I first came here about a month ago and we ordered the Thai dinner set menu to go. It had a variety of items and we all liked it. 

I thought I would try it again, so yesterday my family and I went to dine in. I ordered the yellow curry.  I should have known better when the server said ""just to let you know it's American style"". Not knowing what that actually meant, I figured I would try it. Big mistake. It wasn't anything like curry. They didn't even use coconut milk. It was just some chicken in some kind of gooey green sauce. It wasn't horrible, but not what I wanted. Actually I think this was their version of green curry and I ordered the yellow. Who knows maybe the yellow is better? 

Sadly, I didn't settle right later in the evening and I had to drink chamomile tea to calm my stomach. I won't go back."
IhHVuBsDBHEDoxdwnos53w,3,"Decided to give this relativity new pizza place to Mentor a try,  have to say, unimpressed. Online ordering was very easy to use. Ordered a large, regular crust garlic sauce pizza & a Cleveland Burger. First, pizza was ready when I arrived & order was correct. Now, to the actual food. I would say that the crust was a bit overlooked for my taste. It was quite crisp but not burnt. I felt like the sauce was non existent. I understand that garlic sauce is a light sauce, but I have had some great garlic sauces. Plus having only cheese, I should be able to taste garlic. Overall, bland. Now the Cleveland Burger - think a Roman Burger. I would venture they cook the burger in the pizza oven. The edges of the burgers are extremely crispy, yes, crispy. Even with the Italian dressing, cheese, tomato & lettuce, it still crunched when I bit into it. I would be a good sandwich if the burger was properly cooked. Sorry, I don't like crunchy burgers.  With so many options in Mentor for pizza, I think I will stay with my tried and true favorite."

-lrzA6IRMah3q6LMVlOfnA,1,"One of the worst restaurants in Little Italy. Went there with a friend recently for a quick bite to eat. Friend got the chicken enchiladas and I got the southwestern burger. Expecting your normal type of meal for the price (enchiladas was $14, burger was $12), we were disappointed with what came out. Though I was told the enchilada was spicy and filling, the burger was a huge disappointment. A small patty, equivalent to the size of a McDouble was provided to me, but came with no sides, and a severely undercooked patty. I'm all for having a medium rare beef patty on my burger, but this was just too rare for my liking and too expensive for what you get. On top of all this, their advertised ""tall boy special,"" where you get a $5 beer is completely false. We got a 355ml can of cheap beer for &5. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't go here unless you're willing to spend a ludicrous amount of money for small portions and mediocre food."
QYKuYyqlMgxBBj090cQd4g,4,"I am so pleased with this place I had to do a 2nd review!  Went back to get my nails refilled and Phan told me that she was ""going to out-do everyone else.""

BHv-ggrWROBaSVkqVV6xBA,5,"Heard nothing but great things about this place. Definitely needed to stop by and see what the rave is about..Simple concept almost like a snack shack/ soda shop. Fiiz drinks has so much variety!! Delicious snacks & drinks. Great establishment. It is kept tidy & presentable. Plenty of sitting room, they also have bar stool chairs which i thought that was pretty cool. The staff is so welcoming, helpful & patient when it came to ordering. Also, if you do not like your drink they will change it, free of charge! I can't wait to come back to try more flavors off their menu or maybe even customize my own!"
dV8TTunn5FXS3gIIZptajA,5,"My boyfriend and I just dined here and had the most amazing experience! The atmosphere is prefect for a romantic date night, or just a fun night out! The hosts were extremely friendly and accommodating with our umbrellas (as it had been raining outside). We were immediately shown to our table which was a cute little corner table perfect for our date night! Our server Jessie was so friendly and personable and had great suggestions as it was our first time there. We dine out pretty often and he provided some of the best service we've had in Pittsburgh in a while. We opted for the four course experience (cheese fondue, salad, entree & chocolate fondue) which was so worth the price. I can't recommend this place enough and will definitely be back for another special occasion!"

sdVLu0QMSswEsHE92OV1vA,4,"Had a coupon for a free appetizer from our  lodging, so thought we would give it a try.  I had to ask our server Stephanie her name (not giving their name is a particular pet peeve of mine,) but she quickly warmed up and gave us individual attention.  She recommended the renowned margaritas, and my wife tried the Paradise Rita and I tried the Chambord Rita.  Both were delicious and refreshing and $1 off due to happy hour.  We had also noticed that wine bottles were half price on Tuesday nights on the way in, and we sprung for the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, and it was crisp and fruity in spite of being a screw top.  For our free appetizer, we got the table side guac, and Stephanie mixed it up at the table, but I noticed she did not use all of the pre-measured salt and pepper and it could have used it.  Still not table side guac up to our expectations.  My wife ordered the habanero chicken pasta, and it was good but the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta were too dry.  I tried the Jack's 5 Cheese macaroni topped with achiote chicken, which was also dry.  The macaroni had bleu, jack, cheddar, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses with bacon, and had a good taste overall but just needed some moistening up.  Served with a skillet of cornbread and honey butter.  As Stephanie was packing up the leftovers for us, two slices of cornbread baptized the table next door, and she brought us a whole cornbread in its place (packed safely we assume in the kitchen!). Overall a great dining experience and we would visit again!"
K-acw-vjdKD9siXQMSV8Vg,5,Amazing food. My wife and I stuck to drinks and appetizers but it was all exceptional. The Executive Chef's English ale onion soup was essentially an immaculate play on the French onion soup. We ordered desert first and the salted caramel cheesecake was a decadent start. The seared diver scallops and chicken pot pie were exceptional as well. The service was attentive. So much so that our waitress replaced the mocha martini that was cleared early by a busser. No charge for it on the final bill. Love this place!
PGpU8Z33aUvB9pvtxAcEkA,4,Attentive staff and the experience was good. I wouldn't say this is any better then some of the places on spring mountain but I would definitely come here again if in the area. The tables are bigger then other places which I definitely could appreciate.
00aSF3sYk4-rvFax2rg-OQ,5,Great place! Anything negative to say is due to not knowing the place! This is the most caring place ever! Come in and get to know the people! Cheers!

She is very professional and friendly and did everything quickly with a smile on her face, not to mentioned she made sure by husband's drink was never empty! We will definitely be back not just for the food but for Rochelle too!!!"

Bf3s1K1kov3l4LUaCC1b8g,1,"When asked to increase my insurance amount, I was passed around so much because no one could figure it out. Call the insurance company they said, and the insurance company said call the store... The store proceeded to charge me twice for that month for insurance. Ok Storage One is incompetent but, stuff happens. THEN I asked for ONE extra day of storage since my closing date got pushed back and they are charging me for an entire month. They'll probably charge me double insurance as well! Now I'm just irritated. At the end of the day, you have human beings as customers. No one would agree that charging someone a full month for one extra day is fair nor is charging double for insurance. There are plenty of storage facilities in this city, I'd choose another one if I were you."
OOx3XQcb_-78z1Yxf34vNQ,3,"I want to give this place a better rating... but to be honest for what they offer and the prices they charge, I can go to better places. 

The restaurant itself is pretty big and nicely decorated with wood panels, simple and somewhat calming. Staff are friendly too... but the one we had was a bit too clingy, coming to our table every few minutes asking about our dishes, and 'advising' us to enjoy the sashimis quickly to maximize the freshness! ... ... just a bit too much. You gotta let your customer to actually 'enjoy' their food.

Their sashimis were good... but not great. The only 'special' menu item was the toro sushi special in my opinion, which lets you try 3 different types of the fish; it ranges from normal to the fattiest part. Something you can't find in many places. If you're a toro lover (like myself) you can give this place a try.

All in all, I just found the food quality and pricing not very well balanced. Nothing to really attract me back here."

I'll admit it, I watch very closely and nervously when I try a new place. When I went here I was a little nervous until I sat down and Henry started working on my nails. He did them exactly how I wanted them with little input from me. And fast! $35 for pink and white fill. That's a little higher than what I'm used to but not by much. This is now my go-to place!"
Snrhs7qn4P0H6z5a-Hy_Bw,4,"I always stay at the Mirage when I'm in town so I decided to check out the spa.  The first spa I tried was QUA at Caesars Palace so I had very high expectations.  Mirage's Spa did not disappoint at all but the size of the spa did.  It was very small, probably a fourth of QUA.  It was very cozy and clean.  I loved the four (4) whirlpools with different water temperatures.  I went on a Sunday morning and I was expecting a lot of people, but to my surprise there were only a handful.  Majority of the time I was in the whirlpool all by myself.  

I tried all the amenities at the Mirage spa but did not have enough time for a massage.  The sauna was awesome.  It was big enough to accomodate about 10-12 people confortably.  The steam room was great too.  It was about the same size as the sauna but with steam.  

The staff members were friendly and the bathrooms, showers and sink areas were kept very clean.  The overall experience of the spa was excellent."
f6OlIaEn6xznRfe9ZQ-sGQ,1,"Yesterday was my 25th birthday and the day before was my 3 year wedding anniversary so my husband and I decided to celebrate at my new favorite place, the cheesecake factory. And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied ""oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once"". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well. Very poor customer service"

cdrEC5pnTa0bRxhF1NLtUA,2,"I went to Kleinfelds to look for my dress and was surprised at how unhelpful the consultant we worked with was.   Aside from getting offended if we did not like the dresses she brought out, she continuously brought out dresses that did not fit the description I was looking for.  

At the end, there was one dress which I thought had potential, she proceeded to pressure sell me and told me I had two days to order the dress on-time for the wedding.  However, every other bridal store I called in Toronto that carried the particular dress (a Maggie Sottero) could get it with ample time to spare."
D25Rp7mqplgUmENwC_G2ag,3,"Breakfast was delicious, just expensive, especially for a breakfast.  The service was impeccable.  Located right off the pool area in the Wynn hotel.

I'd come back, but it's not top on my list in Vegas."

The massage chairs are nice and this spa has a nice clean, stylish vibe.  Classic pedicure was $26.  Ive gotten more for the same price elsewhere (hot stone + sugar scrub) but the gentleness of the pedicure has me second guessing going back there."
Sp9dVeZ12aOvlXkOaE0fWQ,5,I have been going to Jeny for 5+ years and she always does an amazing job! This time wasn't any different; Jeny was able to give me the ashy blonde that I have always wanted!! She an expert when it comes to hair coloring and knows what will and will not work. I always leave the salon satisfied with the results whether it be with hair highlights or balayage or getting make up done for a special occasion. I love that she actually listens to what you want! She is easy to talk and you can tell she is very passionate about what she does. My days of box dying my hair are over. I couldn't imagine going to anyone else for my hair or makeup needs.

I decide that the holy moly looked good and I really wanted to eat something healthy. The chicken holy moly comes with black beans, rice, salad, and tortillas. The tortilla taste homemade and they are so good the black beans and rice are also very delicious. I absolutely love the holy moly and I recommend it. The place is really cute and trendy and the staff is really nice and it's a great experience."

~Close to restaurants and a gas station

Decent place for a good price, so I would definitely stay here again."
jOExIeF5jnQuX-duBDyXrw,2,"Went there last night for dinner.  

What I liked was the fish, not too greasy and tasted good.  

What I didn't like was
* services was impersonal - didn't offer water, didn't check in if I wanted a refill on my pop or if the food was ok.
* fries were bland, maybe not that fresh.  Could have been frozen
* garlic cheese bread was almost like a hot dog bun opened up with cheese and garlic (over priced)
* washrooms was super small (two small for more then one person - should be a private washroom) and smelled like bleach.  At least wait till the restaurant is closed before throwing bleach down everywhere.

Not running back there anytime soon. Maybe next time I'll do take out.  Too bad as they have a liquor licence and I like to drink."
v5vl1WWHJcpVhwj0gMUR6Q,2,Came in today and got a haircut and I asked for a skin fade. At first I liked it and not even lying I really did but then I got home and looked at it more then realized it wasn't a skin fade at all and my side burns were cut square and it didn't look good at all and I don't know why she cut it anyways I didn't say I wanted that cut. So what I got was my sides cut to a number 2 and my side burns lookin weird. Now I don't want to be mean or rude I don't think she knew everything she was doing but I will say the name of my barber which was Kimberly. She did good honestly but I don't think she knew what a skin fade was. I'm not happy with my haircut

a3XZZEHaCCCIEKSzKOO_pw,5,"I have been going to DiMaggio's for 9 years.  In that time I have had 4 different vehicles.  Tom, Sterling and Lonnie are as good as it gets.  If you have a Ford question ask for Sterling.  He is an absolute expert when it comes to Ford especially pickups.  Having an honest shop is very important.  I don't question Tom at all.

I recently purchased a 2001 Ford F250 as a project truck.  I knew it needed ball joints and I don't have the tool to do the work.  I took it to Sterling so he could look it over and make me a list of items.  He must have spent hours on the truck making me a two page list of things that needed to be done.  I had him replace the front ball joints, front brakes and the front drive shaft.  I figured since he already had it apart why not do the work.  I was amazed at how low the price was for the repair.  Tom was extremely fair with me and didn't charge me for Sterling giving it the once over.  I was so impressed I bought the shop lunch.

Tom will always have a list of things wrong with your vehicle.  He does this to help you out.  Most times people don't fix items until they break and are stranded.  Work with him.  Let his team make the list so you know what is wrong.  Ask what items need to be fixed right away and what items can wait.  I have done this with my wifes 2004 Ford Focus.  We have had repairs that we planned out and it took 6 months to complete based on the money we had available.  Tom is as honest as a person can be.  

Most people get frustrated when it comes to vehicle repairs because they don't know anything about vehicles.  I suggest to take it to DiMaggio's, let them make a list of what is wrong, then do a search on the internet to get educated on the repair.  You will soon see that they have the correct approach and you will feel more confident about the repair."

Mmmm ""don't you want to walk us through your delicious top selling items.?"" To say the least; THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE FROM THE MINUTE WE WALKED IN TO THE MINUTE WE WALKED OUT. I can go on and on about my whole experience... I didn't see the workers smile not once to all the customers walking in, so unprofessional, no one asked how we were doing... how our food was, nothing...didn't get a warm ""Welcome"" nor a ""Thank you, have a good day.!"" Small things like that matter because this isn't a ""chain"" restaurant you gain clientele by word of mouth and ""reviews"" from experienced individuals. There's so many other places to choice from ESPECIALLY being down in the heart of Fremont. Take your business elsewhere."

When we finally squeezed into a spot at the bar, we were greeted by an amazing bartender. Pete gave us the low down on all the beers; he even shed light on the merger of Southern Tier and Victory Brewing! He was well-versed, welcoming and attentive despite the massive crowd; a welcome change from our 2nd stop on the bike tour. :) We ended up ordering a pint of 8 Days a Week and Lemon Drop Sun. Both were delicious!  We also shared a Victory Root Beer which was sugary sweet! I imagine adding vanilla ice cream would make the drink a stellar dessert. All in all, the modern decor of the venue, the beautiful new patio and the charismatic, hardworking staff made our visit a wonderful experience! Thanks Southern Tier!"

I probably would've gone back for the sushi, but the level of customer service is 0. I had brought my friend a gift that he accidentally left behind. We literally went back an hour later to pick it up, but the staff said that they threw it out in the trash, and if we're still interested to find it then we should start digging in their garbage. Like, who dares to say such a thing in service industry? I will never step foot there again. That was my first and last time."

Will definitely find another place to eat next time!

It's a cute, quaint place. Pretty perfect for a casual meal. 

I ordered the small poutine and Imran had the lasagna. He seemed to enjoy it. Unfortunately, I forgot to say ""vegan"" in front of ""poutine"" and inadvertently took a bite out of a real cheese curd. It was sooo good, but sooo bad for me. When I realized my mistake, they were really quick to fix it, giving me a vegan poutine within 5 minutes. She was also really apologetic, which was unnecessary since it was my mistake, but appreciated.

The poutine was great! And the price was right, $6 for a poutine I couldn't even finish. 

I will definitely be back again."

I definitely agree that Showmars may have been better when they are smaller - what are they up to now, some 30 locations?  I'm happy for them and all, but they just lose something when they are no longer trying as hard.

The menu board is not in a prominent place so you really don't know what is available until you get to the counter.  you can add toppings but everything is hidden so you have to ask for specific things to be added to your plain slice.
The pizza is inexpensive, tasty, and pizza....nothing super special or out of the ordinary.  If I was staying at the hotel I would probably order a whole pizza and eat it in the room (no seating) but until then I won't be returning."
-Saa7y9_u5d7OHghOaujqQ,5,"Wow! Great ambiance, great service, clean and professional. They can serve so many in no time. Full house and doesn't feel so claustrophobic. Great dinner feeling.  Love that they use Quebec products."

Just stayed for 3 nights for a wedding in the area and he came to our rescue for room and services!!!He couldn't have been more professional. THANK YOU Dominic and your staff for an excellent stay in Scottsdale. My wife and I will be back!"

Ur9ccsrEasr_ywaJcFo0LA,4,"Tried this place and many other in Vegas. My first hot yoga experience was here. It combines all my favorite things heat, yoga practice and exercise. I myself love the sauna but an hr seemed crazy. Guess what though...I made it through multiple times!!! They offer an assortment of different styles, not all yoga is hot, some are fast and very slow or holding of the pose (Yin), kettlebell, new kids classes per an email which I think is awesom!!! I feel like if this place made me step up my athletic ability. Overall it's very clean. I feel it's managed well. Oh yeah, they have a cafe place with fresh yummy goodies. I bought my first yoga sweat towel here. It's nice but was quite pricey. The only thing that keeps me from going here more often is distance from where I live. TRY IT OUT!!! I enjoyed my experience here. Far exceeded my expectations."
JJICn3qmHwPV7ILfz3cMjQ,4,"The food was ok, I love waffle fries and the produced some spicy delicious ones so I was pretty happy.  Drinks were cheapo schmepo (again I'm from out of town and found Madison delightfully affordable) but the main event here was the boxing game.  
We were with a group of family and friends in town for a wedding and everyone was getting into this thing...my boyfriend, my brother, my uncle, even our friends in town from Norway (in their 50s) were all over this thing!  It was so fun!
They had a ton of stuff to chose from so it's an easy to please all type of place.  also a lot of seating, inside and out, so it was a great stop for us.  Nothing amazing and above and beyond but fun for a college town."

Manager was courteous and efficient! It resolved my issue!

Thank you Yomaira for giving me consistent updates and greet me with a beautiful smile!"
PpXBckTrmDi9LTti_DeBFA,2,Customer service was good. However the food was subpar. They were out of salmon for my Caesar Salad and offered a Caesar and Shrimp Salad but the lettuce was dead and brown. I don't think I will return. #marketBENITEZ
0Y6vZNP4T4iAEHoxeUPuHg,5,Great ice cream and always new flavors. Draw back is when your kid wants 2 kinds of ice cream.  They apparently have a manager rule that does not allow the employees to make 2 small scoops to put in a small cup. = sad kid :-(
Ng2jBQETpJGX1EYyqfKHPw,3,"Let me start with the positive. The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup. The chicken egg roll was very greasy. My main dish was the cashew chicken. It was white meat but had to pick through it to get a decent piece without icky's on it. The flavor was bland, so I decided to add chili paste. It was hot, but tasteless. It was on the way to downtown, but will note return here again. YUCK!!!"
-6vryerwkQBtuvxjsJI--A,1,"My friend was famished (I ate dinner) and we walked by Sneaky Dees. I had always wanted to try this place.
It was 2 a.m. so after last call. I asked the bouncer if we could still order food (expecting a no) but was surprised when he said yes! Wow, isn't Toronto great. Things are OPEN after 11!!!
We were seated and didn't see a server for ten minutes. I was timing.
When my friend politely tried to get his attention, he replied with a snarky ""I see you, bro"".
Rude.
He took our order and we waited FORTY FIVE MINUTES to get our food.
That tainted my experience.
I was so fed up as it was after 3 a.m. I asked the girl who carried it over to wrap it up.
She gave a bit of attitude, started arguing with our original server, then put it in a to go container.
We left immediately after.
The food tasted good.
The service was beyond horrible.
I'd be willing to give it another try because it does look like a fun place.
Maybe for drinks... not for food."
rTkVeuyEynG2214QzMSlvQ,3,"I came here a couple times and I was not that impressed with their food. However, the service was pretty good. The restaurant is located in the far left corner of the Smith's shopping center and might be hard to find. The inside is nicely decorated, quite spacious and clean. They do both a la carte and all you can eat here. I have never tried their AYCE menu but I've had several items on their a la carte menu. The ramen and sushi here are quite underwhelming but their salads and bento boxes are on point. All in all, I would come back for their lunch menu but I wouldn't go here for AYCE Sushi."
bl6wKFBTRCMhqBldYC109Q,5,"If you have to have a legit Omakase experience from beginning to end, I would highly recommend Kabuto.

Besides some of what has already been said on Yelp, here are some of my highlights:
- $48 Nigiri Omakase. Not gonna find this anywhere at an upscale sushi restaurant in LA, DC or NYC. Most are in the $75+ range. They also have an $80 and $120 Omakase as well.
- Reservations. Reservations. Reservations. The first time my friend went, they were booked solid all weekend. It only has around 20 seats inside so you likely won't be able to walk in and get a table.
- High quality sushi from trained sushi chefs. Amazing scallop, blue fin tuna, uni, mackerel etc.
- Service was impeccable
- Highly enjoyed that once you were done with your nigiri, you could order additional pieces of fish such as uni or blue fin tuna prior to the hand roll portion. Usually nobody wants to order more fish after dessert.

Highly recommend this place anyone looking for a authentic Japanese Omakase experience while in Las Vegas. Will be back!"
Zv3kJwx-TNOXncTqzFHydw,5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Consistently delicious and authentic food. I always order the tajadas con queso and the cachapa con queso y cochino frito. Yum. Service is always friendly too, and if you have any questions about the menu, the staff are happy to answer them."
mBXi7otr3YoEMUjX9yKCuw,4,"This was my first time visiting this buffet. I had heard a lot of good things about it but I had to go and see for myself what the buzz was all about.

I came on a Friday night and as you can imagine it was pretty packed which is a good sign of course, and the precursor of what the food might taste like. 

Well I managed to get in the buffet, first impressions were that it looked very clean, it was nice and organized and all the food stations looked very professional.

Visually the food look very appetizing especially the protein area with good prime rib, chicken, and other various meats.

I tasted food from the Asian section , the American section, Italian section, and the Mexican section and I have to tell you everything I tasted was very delicious! 

I was not disappointed, the price to get in was $19.95 which is not bad for dinner and even better when the food is very delicious.

Before I left I tried the dessert section and the choices they have for dessert we're pretty good with a lot of variety. They also have a nice gelato section which visually looks very good, and fancy and the taste did not disappoint either.

Overall I'm giving this buffet 3.5 stars, it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be back in the future."
oxPvVqRIi9mx4LJPjdP9vw,4,"Not too bad overall. 
Pros:
Great local selection of beer
Atmosphere
Very cool wine tap system with temperature controlled partitions
Good food
Local community presence 

Cons:
They use an app style credit card system which seems a bit clunky
Only choice if water is tap which has a distinct chlorine taste. You would think that at a place where people pay attention to subtle flavors in their wine and beer they would invest in a water filter or offer bottled water for purchase."
biPT_81dCEZEbu9a3OMJsQ,4,"This place is awesome!!
My boyfriend & I are absolutely gobsmacked as to why this place isn't more popular, so I decided I'd help out by giving them a raving review, as they deserve more business!
I first heard about this place from a BlogTO review & the pics looked amazing, so we decided to come on down. The prices are ridiculous, as in ridiculously fair, for what you're about to be blessed with?! For the great quality and freshness and be-YOO-tiful presentation, everything is a steal!! 

So you have low prices, and high quality, fantastically presented food. What's NOT to love? 
My BF reaaaally enjoys their Sea Honey, and I love all their sashimi trays! Oh man, I kinda want to go back tonight, now that I'm re-living my experiences...
The waitresses are always very pleasant as well =)

We've already returned for a second visit! Go on, give Amico a try...you'll love it too!"
3gxFWbrXcmBZBQTEbaXdbg,4,"Perfect restaurant to bring visitors to the Old Port of Montreal for work dinner. The ambiance is great, stone walls, beautiful ceilings and operating fire place on each floor. If the municipality of Montreal could fix the side street our guests would be even more impressed, but of course that has nothing to do with the food quality.

The restaurant is advertising itself as a steak house and they are proud of their Canadian beef, as such they really know how to make a good steak. Very happy with my centre cut fillet mignon, prepared exactly medium rare as requested, very slightly burned from outside as I like it. Besides the steaks some of my companions also enjoyed their black cod. We wanted to share with our guests the pride of the Montreal cuisine, the roast beef poutine. The poutine was a little bit disappointing, fries were kind of cold and the roast beef presence was minimal. I guess we shocked the chef with that order. 

The service is great. I started the night with classic dry martini, so good. The cocktail list needs to be explored by me again. With that said I would come some other time for a personal dinner and when in need of a good steak."
wlCI4Am9Eu1bVxbYtiEU_Q,5,Desert Saddlery is one of our first stops on Saturday. Tom is the only person on the east side (and maybe the whole valley) that does saddle/tack repair and custom work. His stitching is as strong as it comes! I've never had anything he repairs break again. He has saved our gear tons of times. The whole crew makes sure you find what you're looking for and are more than willing to search diligently to find it. I could not think of a better place to purchase tack. Lifetime customers for sure!

There have two locations in Vegas, Aria, and Bellagio, it's MGM's answer to Bouchon bakery, and it's infinitely superior.
Delicious flaky, fluffy, crusty, buttery, creamy, sweetness, all in one place, it's so decadent, if it was 1920 would have been banned, it would have been illegal, it would be prohibition.
I know there are great bakeries in Las Vegas, but on the strip, this is the one to visit. 
If you are looking for something less indulgent, they also have delicious sandwiches, and savory pastries and crêpes.
You can also special order a lunch box, and will be ready right before your trip, so you can enjoy a delicious meal instead of airport food."
CsTEs1tLj-0pQteCLbDGoA,3,"The Bag Lady makes me want to take up Tarot.  And dip my toe into goddess worship.  And make my own wand (it sells at least one book on home wand making).

It smells pleasantly of incense and the faintest whiff of crazy, and every time I pass through, I imagine my life as it would be filled with swishy skirts, long hair, beautiful but odd jewelry, and a straight left turn toward the spiritual.

As it is, the naturalist in me likes to peer into the ever-wistful world of The Bag Lady, but I never really stay very long.  I do like to visit, though.  It makes me feel like I'm in Rivendell."
iodXrdczla4TJ2aXprfG9A,4,"Update: Came by to share a black sesame and a matcha soft serve (in waffle cones). The matcha is very strong and bitter which I did enjoy since I like tea flavoured food but warning for those who dont like bitter ice cream. They told us the black sesame soft serve tonight was apparently grittier than normal but we chose to go with it anyway and it tasted great to me. If I had to pick, black sesame wins over matcha all the way. Lack of comfy seats!

---

Five stars for the black sesame soft serve. Reminds me of the (much better than here) 7/11 everywhere in Japan serving the most awesome varieties of soft serve ice cream including black sesame. I would say its even better as there is a real sesame taste while still being creamy. 

Service was good, the guy asked if we wanted to try a sample of the hokkaido milk when we wondered what that flavour of milkshake would taste like. Not enough seats. Would be hard to stand outside when cold, but we didnt need to line up at all as we came an hour before they closed.

Will be back to try the matcha flavour... that is if I can resist the black sesame!"

Loved that I could get a 1/2 sandwich, the New Yorker brought me back to my Jersey days.  Cucumber salad on the side was great too.  Friendly staff, nothing to complain about!  Its a long way from home in Seattle to this place but if I find myself in the area again I will make sure I get back!  I'd love to try more on the menu because everything looks great."
ZUchy0pxqzaYN4BhJye9Nw,1,"I've frequented both this location on Cactus, as well as the on on Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright (Bell) since they both opened. Truth be told,  I've always preferred the Scottsdale location, and while the menu is the same, I've noticed the Scottsdale location was faster and more consistent in their food.  I'll NEVER set foot in here (Cactus) again, and here's why:  October 22, 2014, I went here with my 7 year old and my Mom. We arrived at 12:40, and by 12:45 we ordered. We watched another table get their food (who arrived after us), and so I asked what was the delay. The waiter said he'd ""go and check on it"", and by 1:20 we still didn't have our food, or an explanation.  (Keep in mind, the lunch rush was pretty much over that day,  as I counted two tables on the patio, and perhaps two more inside with customers still eating.) So, here I am with a hungry 7 year old and mother who's diabetic, and NEVER expecting to be waiting over 45 minutes at this point for food.   Ok. Things happen. Orders sometimes aren't entered in, I GET that.  I assumed someone either forgot to put in our order, or someone forgot to cook it, so I asked for some bread.  An easy request for an italian restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). The waiter disappeared, and 10 minutes later, still no bread. I asked where it could be, and he said they needed to BAKE some.  What was inexcusable was that he was completely indifferent, not interested in correcting the terrible service, and the manager who came over was equally inept and unapologetic. My kid is awesome and patient, and so is my Mom.  I worked in restaurants many years of my life, and so I think I'm more forgiving than most but this was it.  We got up, walked out, and went over to Oregeno's across the street and proceeded to get top-rated service and food from these guys.  The reason Yelp is fabulous is you can have a head's up on what to expect at businesses. Just know what to expect here."

He came highly recommended by two close friends and I am so thankful to them for connecting me with this therapy.  I went in with no expectations, went with the flow guided by my inner longing for balance.  Brandon provided a welcoming and safe space for therapy to occur. Our conversation left me feeling hopeful and peaceful. Today I feel a higher level of clarity while last night I felt like my whole body was restored while I slept. Thank you Brandon for your kindness, understanding, wisdom, and guidance ! You are a true friend to humanity ! Can't wait to work with you again."

jOnAaSr6wX5ibTbnJaexAQ,1,"What a total disappointment.  My husband and I have used AAA Auto Buying program for a few cars in the past and it was always amazing.  Spec out the car online and dealers email their lowest bids for your inspection.  No sitting in showrooms while the salespeople play the game of ""let me check with my manager"".  AAA had also given us access to low price financing that was useful to have when the dealership wanted you to use their financing....we'd say not unless you can beat the low rate from the AAA provider.  Moved to NC and used the AAA Carolinas site-what a disappointing difference!  On a Saturday afternoon, there was only 1 customer service person available to help with the process and at that, he didn't have access to the loan application or 2018 model cars yet.  What?  We went to the Sam's Club auto buying site and had much better luck using the same TrueCar system that AAA uses.  We've already got 2 quotes and the AAA guy says the car we want is very difficult to find?  No it's not.  3 dealers in our Raleigh area have them on the lot.....don't know whose minding the store for AAA but I'd recommend using another service if its available for you!"

Tried 6 different types of empanadas, chips and salsa, and tres leches cake - all soooo delicious!

WgKAlVk92B9oa6eLHcXgJw,1,"The Office Staff don't follow directions and because of their lack of detail we had to pay for another CT scan at our Oral Surgeons Office.
They gave my wife a Surgeon referral after the CT scan, my wife told the front desk folks not to send the CT info to that Surgeon until we could check to see if he was in OUR Network. That afternoon she called their Office back and told them their referral Surgeon was NOT in our network and do not send the CT info. 2 hours later my wife called them again with a Network Oral Surgeons information and instructed them to send her CT info to this Surgeon, this was Oct. 27th.
We went out our Network Oral Surgeon on Nov. 7th and he did not have the CT info, so more scans had to be done & paid for.
I called Dr. Krygiers Office on the afternoon of the 7th and was told by his office staff they sent the CT info to the wrong Surgeon (their referral).
We paid Dr. Krygier $339.00 and got NOTHING....we want a refund and a apology.
His office gave out information to the wrong Surgeon!!   Extremely poor Service."

He went above and beyond by completely repairing our pool vacuum, while efficiently taking care of every other customer in the store, providing us valuable information, and entertaining us the whole time. The repair was free of charge, and expertly taken care of! We will certainly be regulars at this Leslie's now. Thanks Steve!"
TwY4EtuR1sdsG-lRZAxnrQ,2,"You know what I hate?  When drive-thru cashiers say, ""Just park up front and we'll bring it out to you.""  I know why they do it.  But I still hate it.  And today's experience at this KFC made my detestation of said practice even stronger.

Ordered a Double Down Sandwich in the drive-thru.  I was told that it would take a few minutes because they didn't have any filets ready at the time.  And, to their credit, the order taker did ask me if an extra few minutes would be okay.  I affirmed and then proceeded to the window,

After paying, the cashier told me to park up front.  Grrr, argh.  I ruefully did so.  After NEARLY 15 MINUTES of waiting ""up front,"" I decided to walk my hungry self into the restaurant.  They'd forgotten about me!

At any rate, I watched them make my sandwich, took it to my car, ate it, and then immediately crafted this review.  Wasn't surprised to see the low ratings given by others."

Ordered their original milk tea with green tea and its just perfect. The right amount of tea and milk  Although this place is a little small. Outside seating is very limited, and we came right when they were open so maybe boba wasn't fully cooked because it was very hard. Besides that, I really liked my drink. Service was excellent and very friendly."

They are big on sanitary practices so I don't mind paying a few extra dollars for it. I've been here at least 3 to 4 times now and have always left very happy with the services provided here. I've had a rotation of just about all of the staff that works there and they are all very friendly. I don't have my nails done on a regular basis but when i do they are definitely my only go to nail salon now. Check them out if you haven't already because you are definitely missing out a great nail salon.
kbNeVnUwsvRW_a8jJzdYgw,5,"Soo Black Tap inside the Venetian is probably one of the best places I've been to of it caliber. Great service, friendly atmosphere, only the best music, and to top it off phenomenal food. I've been twice now. From their monstrous shakes, almost perfect poured beers to a perfectly cooked burger. Guacamole you can eat by itself I just can't explain it you just have to go there!!

However, with all its deliciousness be sure to spend money. $15 shakes and $20 burgers, but you only live once and great food should be a must.

Going to NY next month to try the original Black Tap...to be continued..."
d5QzEe_rPWs4zymBZe11bw,5,"Halo was a great experience!! I went back in March with a friend who was getting a second lobe piercing and I myself got my navel pierced. I knew of friends who had gone there for piercings and it was very close to us so we figured hey, why not? 

We had Ana and she was just about the coolest person I've ever met. Something about her personality just makes you feel very reassured that she knows what she's doing. My friend has a huge fear of needles and I was very impressed that Ana saw that as completely valid (though my other friend and I were giving our friend a hard time about it) and did everything she could to make her feel at ease. 

Ana was meticulous about having the correct spacing between the first piercing and the second, and making the second piercings look even, and had me and my other friend check her work. I was very impressed, when I got my doubles at Claire's it was nowhere near as detail oriented, oops! 

Then came time for my belly button, and it was great!! I am so happy with the way it turned out, I love the jewelry I bought (not exactly cheap but worth the price to not get an infection from crappy metal) and Ana did an excellent job placing the piercing in the right spot. I paid about $120 total, $40 for the piercing and $68 for the jewelry, plus tax. There are cheaper jewelry options available, I just chose to go with a sterling silver curved bar with CZ stones at both ends, which I imagine is on the pricey side, though they did have yellow gold options available. 

On a scale of 1-10, the pain was probably a 4. I've had bruises that hurt more than that did! Ana even said that cartilage hurts more, which I can see. The nice thing too is the only time it ever hurt was during the actual piercing, once the jewelry was in I could barely even feel that it was there! 

Super cute and I got it with enough time to heal a bit before summer swim season. Ana was very strict about not swimming but I started swimming 2 months after with no problems. I even went to Panama and swam in rivers with god knows what living in it, and the ocean, but still no infection! I will say though that chlorine dries out the skin a lot and pools harbor a lot of bacteria so be sure to clean it after swimming. 

Halo is the best and I recommend it to everyone I know!! Everything is super clean and the whole process is a well oiled machine and you really feel like these people know what they are doing. If I decided I want any more piercings, I will definitely go back!! Oh, and for all you teenagers out there, you get 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday (still have to buy the jewelry but hey that's a great deal)."
uYfFe7pVMf0i0tUDPUvlxQ,5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this store!  The organized freak comes out in me every time I enter!  A store that organizes it's merchandise by color...Thank You and much appreciated!!  Inexpensive and very cute stuff!  This is a weekly stop for this Vegas girl!

Scared to order too much like we do at other Italian restaurants, we decided to order three entrees for the four of us.  It was perfect.  Pastas weren't heavy and the sauces were amazing.  We will be back for sure.  Best Italian place we've found in green Valley."
SdI_dtCtr3-jTPnkD4keFg,5,"The problem with most BBQ places is that they try and get big way to fast. When they do this they lose the passion for the food. Then they turn into an assembly line and portions get smaller to cut cost and jack up profits. 

This is not the case for Jesse Rae's. The passion is truly alive in the food that is served. I have had almost every BBQ place in town and I can not express how much I love the food here.  Fair prices for a great meal!  

You must take the time and stop in for lunch. Amazing food!"
2AkrKoYnbv82Rv1_5EEYAQ,4,"You can't make a trip to Vegas without ""recharging"" every day with at least one of these iconic drinks. 

My best advice is to get the classic Yard Dog (32oz) size -- if you're looking for high alcohol content, your answer lies in the 44 Magnum: a mix of Hurricane and 190 Octane. It might not be as tasty as some of the other flavors, but you'll get the best bang for your buck! I also recommend adding an extra shot (only $1!). Of course, all the flavors are delicious if you don't care about how much alcohol there is, but my second choice is always Pina Colada, Mardi Gras Mash, or Margarita with added salt on the top of the cup.

**NOTE** I would highly advise against buying anything with more volume than the Yard Dog unless you're splitting it with one or more people. I'm not questioning the volume you can drink, only the speed -- you do not want a melted daiquiri on your hands. It's disgusting. 

All the workers here are so, so lighthearted and do their best to make you laugh. I've never seen a single worker at Fat Tuesday without a smile on their face.

The worst aspect about this place is that because of its great location (in the Miracle Mile shops), it's the most popular Fat Tuesday in Vegas -- and the line can get incredibly long. However, they do try to make it as efficient as possible by making sure you have your ID out at the front of the line. If you're waiting with friends, it shouldn't take too long to get your drink. This should go for all of Vegas, but don't forget your ID! They only accept certain forms of identification, so if you have an ID card from another country, it's safest to just bring your passport. 

**TIP** Bring back your old container and save a few bucks on your next drink! For the Yard Dog (32oz), a regular drink is $14, and the discounted price is $11."

Great job at follow through and customer service.  We look forward to coming back and trying this place as it was highly recommended by a friend. I am sure they won't disappoint."
Aqm-imQ5qE5cOvnX1mLdyQ,3,"Very disappointing :( I really wanted to love this place being that it's so near to us. The service was great, there was one waiter who was friendly & attentive. Food was poor quality. 

Appetizers: Spring roll- I'm not a huge fan of spring rolls to begin with but my bf ordered. I thought the wrap was too thick, I'm big on texture and it felt weird. Wontons were probably the best dish, fried Foods can never go wrong. 

Main course: we both got pho, I had the well done brisket & steak pho which came with about 3 pieces of meat. I ordered more meat on the side which was a $2 up-charge.

Dessert: mango sticky rice is one of my fav desserts, sticky rice was good not the best quality and mangos were about to go bad, very mushy & flavor was almost tart.

Overall, I thought the place was well kept but I will not be returning."
sf5NPLo1mT2UtHKOHQk6OQ,3,Not loving how they constantly kept changing their menu. I came here when it initially opened and was going there probably once a week (embarrassed to say) for their pandan rolled ice cream with condensed milk and coconut flakes (SO BOMB) but they discontinued that and I haven't been back since. Hope they bring it back because I wasn't a fan of their other flavours. Pandan was what made them stick out in my opinion especially with all the rolled ice cream stores opened now
ru0Gdmg0d3si2OiFuRBwKA,5,The lobster mashed potatoes is absolutely delish!  We came here on a Wednesday night and there was live music which was pretty cool.  We ordered Kumomoto oysters and the scallops for appetizers and share the bone-in filet and the mashed potatoes.  Everything was delish and our server was super attentive.  Will definitely go back.
mp_vAksW3U1XccHceHW7jw,5,I like CVS better than Walgreens ! Thy are clean and the employees are always helpful and polite
pvXmaOkr8jV-cdWAD4mL1Q,5,"I stopped here with my husband the other night while we were in town and loved it! It was in the evening which made the already gorgeous cars even prettier. This is the first time I've seen Lamborghinis close up vs going down a street so I was very excited! Clearly I didn't touch them but loved looking at them. I loved how well kept the dealership and lot was too. They had what seemed to be a private event inside at the time, but that's fine too. Just shows how individualized their customer care is! I hope to return soon!"
3n1z56zlRLhT6urpGwbamA,5,"Insane views, reasonable price. Would highly recommend. I needed a room ASAP and the lovely Jessica at the front desk was super helpful and even gave me a late check out !
Incredible service, the room was so beautiful with a gorgeous view and bathroom. 
You gotta stay here"
TXHNBJ9_kBAwFqB1E9rWTw,4,Came here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I had the salmon with sausage and potato hash which was divine and a drink (forgot which one) which was quite tasty. The cornbread was sadly not memorable. The ambience is hip. Wish I had room for the dessert. Next time...
xfQU_8Qp5uZ_-eJ7OBKbYQ,5,"Ginger is my all time favorite dental hygienist. I am very sensitive and she makes sure I am doing ok the entire cleaning. She remembers every detail of my life, even if I haven't seen her in 6 months. I have never felt so comforted during a teeth cleaning. Also, she does a fantastic job cleaning my teeth and truly cares about me and my teeth. I would highly recommend her to my closest friends and family."
rvIRInTp1NLA3K5tOLDlZA,5,"I visit this restaurant at least three times a week. The food is fresh and so well seasoned. The service is above and beyond my expectations. The location is well kept and very clean. You cannot go wrong with your selection. The new management and cashier are great. If you have visited this restaurant two months prior you may have experienced hiccups, but not with these new owners. I promise it won't disappoint!"
ebSpg4QmafPe1zFJDP1Vow,5,"I ordered the spicy striploin and salsa verde sandwich from here last week via Uber eats and it was so delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the flavours were amazing. I did sub out the Brie for mozzarella and they did that for me, no problem. As good as this was after a bit of a transit time I am itching to go in there and having an item or two fresh."
OxEjsL8H_q67ZQh9eeS9-Q,2,"The food is fine.  Classic Denny's food and quality,
The staff are nice.
It is, however, the worst managed Denny's I have ever been in.  We live nearby and were happy there was a local, very nice looking Denny's.  After several meals there, we're about to give up.  You wait forever to be seated - today, with an almost empty restaurant and 6+ wait staff, it was because all the tables were dirty.  The waiter rapidly wiped off the table and tossed the rag to the next dirty table.  I took photos of the dirty tables and tray full of dirty dishes that stayed right by us throughout our meal.  The wait staff appear to be untrained. No one cleans table; the wait staff run around empty handed, never picking up a dirty dish.

Where's the manager?    

Whoever owns this particular Denny's - get yourself an experienced manager who knows how to assign sections to wait staff; get a bus boy and keep the tables ready for customers."
U220I9pmiI2WfBYgpZY2sQ,4,Our waiter made some suggestions and we went ahead and ordered them. not disappointed!  Enjoyed everything and the sushi was fresh as always!
Ny3H-c_IU3wKgnAsNgueTQ,5,"I really love this place and their customer service. I live Charlotte but I work in Rock Hill and this place is super convenient in the mornings. I have paid twice this much for juice in Clt and this place is just as good. I only have their juice but it's top notch. When the lines get long, they come outside and take order to make the line move faster, which I appreciate. It's all drive through, so don't expect to sit anywhere."
4gkK3_G9f8B31KYQ5EY39A,3,"I'm leaving this review solely based on the female manager with brown hair. The last few times I've been here, I can't help but notice how exceptionally lazy and unqualified she is. I used to be a manager so I know there are times when you have other duties to take care of, so you're unable to help your staff out, but she seems to take advantage of that power.

I was at this location a while back and noticed her kind of just hanging out while the other workers were slammed with a line of people. Since then, I've started to pay more and more attention to it each time I come. After today, I don't think I will be returning to this location.

I came during the lunch rush and to no surprise, walked in to find the employees hard at work and the manager doing..... nothing but standing there with the worst resting b*tch face I've seen in a while. So, being the person I am, asked her a simple question to see if maybe I was wrong about her. But nope. Her personality matched her face perfectly. A short b*tchy answer and then she went and hid out in the back. 

A little word of advice, try being a little more pleasant and helpful like the rest of your staff and maybe you wouldn't be so miserable. 

5 stars to the rest of the staff and facility itself. Get rid of her and I'm sure this location would do a lot better."
TUsnGJRSZHhLCkGdatl0Vw,5,"Dave of Ride the Wave Travel went way above and beyond to creat the ideal itinerary for my new bride and I to enjoy a dream honeymoon! No easy task as it was very last minute with a few twists along the way. He was able to secure two 7-day cruises back to back, without leaving our cabin, and coordinated 14 days worth of free drinks saving us about $1,500. In addition to this our departure was delayed by a day, and Dave assisted in filing the claim to reimburse us through the travel insurance company (he strongly recommended the insurance which I usually decline!)  THANKS DAVE!!!!"
vFeCiBunvZEkMuHhAICRJA,3,"Good selection of food, but the service is what brings my rating down from 4 stars.  It's not that the workers are lazy - but there aren't enough people there!  Guests end up busing their own tables because no one has been around the clear the dirty dishes.  Forget soda refills.  

This buffet is a little more expensive than other hotels, but if you're a gambler, chances are you'll get a free ticket with a fair amount of play.

Lots of selection to satisfy.  My plate is usually loaded with shrimp cocktail and their lamb roast.  Good variety of desserts from cookies to tiramisu."
Jme3jVECMuW_RT9KwG7c4Q,5,"Great experience!  Maria, the owner, was so friendly and helpful.  We just stopped in without an appointment and she took her time with my mom.  Very positive."
3QY7kctBIZ9-M8QZHqLciw,5,"Great food, friendly people working, the chicken shawarma was full of flavor, juicy and the humus went well with the dressing.  I'd order it again."
pkCRFwl-kRZosKf2Df0prQ,5,"Amazing service from start to finish! Super cute decor inside and the food is great. I would highly suggest coming here. My friend and I stopped here for lunch and it was the perfect spot. They're very quick, and they even have WiFi."
UPYwqLVvZC5QpTzvooCzjw,2,"Ive gone here a few times.  The food is ok, but not really outstanding in any way.

I find the restaurant itself cramped and unwelcoming, and I find the service kind of snippy.  It always seems like I'm bothering them, making them work.  Went with a friend once, who asked for a little extra sauce on his dish, and he was curtly informed that it was impossible, because it was pre-packaged, and came in precise measures for each customer.  Draw your own conclusions.

Good if you're desperate I suppose.  Always closed on Mondays."
V1fu5nIuDRjfgb9jRA_YHw,1,Ramona is the worst person here! Very rude she even screamed at me! Doesn't care bout customer! Very racist!!! Also Carolyn she also make faces of customer!
8DRvVVH03BauWjesdLtbdQ,5,"We are a family who usually don't have good luck with hotels.  We finally picked a good one. I highly recommend this hotel. It isn't located on the strip and it is clean!  The room looks like a mini apartment. It has a huge bathroom with a shower and a whirlpool tub. It has a kitchen with a stove, microwave, full size refrigerator, sink, a lot of cabinets and counter.  It has a living room, separate from the bed room with a sofa that pulls out into a bed, a desk, fireplace, balcony, and a flat screen tv. It even has a washer and dryer inside. The bedroom was nice also. The room has plenty of closet space. This hotel is great for families. It has valet parking only so bring plenty of tip money. It has a restaurant and indoor pool. Great place!!!!"
6TDVsVnH4oDwHd8X5VdMxw,5,"I've been coming to the same store for the past six years and I've always come out happy with a new pair of glasses. After visiting 8 different optical store in Boston (where I live now) I still found myself coming back here for a new pair of glasses. The owner and his staff are super attentive and offers great opinion on what's in style and what looks good on you. The store is tri-lingual - english, Mandarin, Cantonese. They have a huge selection of glasses ranging from Ray Bans, Oliver and people's, Dior, and most Luxottica. Best of all, they offer fantastic prices for all frames and lenses and very fast turn around time. 

I would definitely recommend to this place to anyone. I plan to come back here no matter where I am in the future."
UiQVTpep5RA8zh2GHVNTGA,4,Awesome comfort food. Staff are warm hearted and very friendly. Best breakfast around. Club sandwiches are very big and filling. Just wish there was a bit more space because it's almost always full with customers
WAQJdnmEZqlBmYu-mlXFPA,1,"Saw a great deal on Groupon - two tickets for $12 bucks.  I decided to go for it...

The owner was very friendly and welcoming.  Seating was first come, first serve which was nice, bathroom was clean and drink prices were reasonable ($4.25 for 22oz Bud Light)...but those were probably the only decent things about the place. 

Our service was horrible.  I ordered a beer and waited 20 minutes to finally get it.  That was it, no service for the rest of the night.  My fiance wanted to order a drink but they never made it back over to our table.  So our tab came to $8 bucks with tip.. Did I save money on a drink tab? Sure..but it would've been nice to have a few drinks.

The comedy was dreadful.  I frequent comedy clubs a few times a year,  but these comics were horrible.  I laughed 3-4 times the entire hour and 15 minutes.  The crowd was eerily quite at times and seem uninterested the majority of the show.  We waited for the ""headliner"" Jonathan Gregory hoping he'd be better than the previous.  WRONG.  We literally wanted to stand up and leave half way through his act, we didn't because we aren't rude people.  His comedy was weird and strange.  Staring off into the crowd & ceiling in silence for 60 seconds just isn't funny.  Just a very strange approach..

Lesson learned, tickets for $6 a piece isn't for no reason.  Waste of a Saturday night.  

I would never go back or recommend this place to anyone."
flxLNmrnvMYcRKF1L3JKUg,1,"Worst meal ever.  The chicken tasted rancid.  The broccoli was burnt on every piece. The mushrooms were not at all cooked.  The bill was completely screwed up.  The kids meals were supposed to be free, when the bill came they were not free.  When I questioned this, the waitress removed 1 of the kids meals, the one that was burnt.  Pretty much nothing was eaten and the dog would not even touch the leftovers.  Don't bother eating here, if you do, you will be sorely disappointed.  Again worst meal I have ever had!"
sFfo4EpK0lmAS1QqIPehOw,1,This beer is not IPA anymore... The company was sold to buttwiper and now I think I got a case of the first edition from the new owners. It taste like garbage... Fuck this company and fuck four peaks for selling out to buttwiper.. This beer isn't true IPA anymore. It's been sold out and now all flavors from four peaks are watered down crap with artificial flavors... There is no pride left for this company... Find true IPA beer elsewhere.. Fuck this
4pQEwppJAdVG0tUem4FeZg,5,As good as any dunkin donuts. The staff was nice and friendly and my food was cooked well and was good.
7V5w2_WN2uOUsBL5-81pVA,1,"This is absolutely the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in!! For starters the apartment building was built in the late 60's cool I like old buildings and the design of that time, but that doesn't mean that everything had to still be from that time inside. Everything is from the 60's and 70's down to the carpets that is missing in most closets. The ""updated"" tile that they where so proud to tell us about turned out to be Vinyl rolled out to look like tiles....the kitchen flooring is totally coming up from the faulty dishwasher also. Everything just looks dirty and dingy. Not only is everything inside the apartment out of date, but then the hallways haven't seen the light of anything new for a while, correction most hallways the main lobbies have just been freshened with a new coat of trim paint.....went from dingy blue to some type of aqua green stuff that looks like the 80's meet the 70's and decided Miami needed to be invited in....the worst thing of all have been the thefts from Amador every package that we have had to have delivered, I have had to replace almost every order we have ordered here due to the lovely neighbors helping themselves to packages left in door ways.... basically don't move here the only positive is the price but like they say you get what you pay for...."
0BPBKPv3LCZxCnDeRXcaog,5,Some really phenomenal service in here. You really don't find that anywhere anymore. I went on their website looking for a specific toy. The website said that this particular store had it in stock. I drove over there only to find out that they had been out of stock for quite some time. The manager actually got on the phone and started calling around trying to find the toy for me. He was able to find it for me at another store and they held it for me until I could get there. He worked so hard for me and I didn't even spend any money in his store. But I will definitely be back.
UuTeLALzvoQJh3buqfKE-Q,5,This week was our first visit from House of yards crew. This company is the best and most professional of any that I have had work on my properties in 30 years. I would recommend them to my family and friends. The crew of just two people got the entire job done on time and above expectations.
1zPGVXXpGBNgyBBbvwn0CA,4,"We have been wanting to try Chef Silvana's food for quite some time. So we finally decided to go and we picked barrio Urbano... a soon we walked in we were happily greeted by Ivette, she was very helpful and made us feel at home...we ordered esquites asados to start. Very tasty.. for our main course we had Enchiladas urbanas and Cochinita pibil. The food was great. Well excecuted.if that wasn't enough, we order the churro with ice-cream for dessert and let me tell you I've had more upscale dessert than this and they are  not even half as good as the churro well done.. They did a great job overall.. little on the warm side.. .. our first time here and we will be back soon .."
w7XxgK4QGFw4iykzKIvE_A,4,"After staying here for a week I feel like I got a great lay for the land. When it comes to the higher end hotels on the Las Vegas Strip this one is at the top of my list. The suites come with a bedroom section that has it's own television and a feeling of privacy from the sunken living room. 

The living room has a flat screen television along with a nice table to get that ""work you promised your boss"" you would do while on the road. The couch is a huge sectional and pretty comfortable for your ""club randoms"" to crash on at night. Great huge bathroom and an overall quality in your suite will leave you sleeping fantastically every night.

My female friend was very disappointed that in November the pool was pretty much cast in shadows all day which really seems like a design error. Clearly the pool area was designed by men if they didn't think woman would want to bask in the sun all day. 

Another bonus is your attached to the Palazzo Hotel which has some great dining/shopping options. It also doubles your indoor gambling space without having to endure the evil Vegas sun. If you are brave enough to walk outside you have a pretty central location on the Strip making it a quick stumble to anywhere you really want to get or a cheap cab. 

Bring some cash if your going to gamble at the Venetian since you will run into some of the higher staked tables on the Strip as well. Parking structure is always crowded but the amount of security leaves me feeling better about leaving the car inside the deck than most places.

The best kept secret at  the Venetian is the Grand Lux Cafe. It is the best valued place to eat on the Strip if you want good food at less than $15 a plate, here is my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-6#hrid:jzPqiv5JxNLjVhJB7sJCKg"
jY04qrSB-ymIXTjQRvDmIQ,3,"Really a 2.5...the point 5 for convenience to my gate...had the hot wings...they delivered the ""hot"" but were pretty tasteless...add salt.  They are long eating so will keep you amused and occupied while you wait...they look MUCH better than they taste...can plug in...but NOT all tables so ask...server was attentive,  beer was Cold!"
oxMpsVLhgvX-SCLSX1GFXQ,4,"First time here and it wasn't too bad.  Service was good, people were nice. Dinner specials were good and fulfilling.  A place we would return to."
6cKaJPLZB40EzTFqcidxDw,4,"casual, fun and great food!  Love coming here for a quick breakfast with the boyfriend, we both love the protein pancakes-AMAZING!  The service is always good and it's not crazy over priced.  Don't go in here trying to impress people with the decor, or an over the top breakfast experience but for your local go to spot for breakfast US Egg is the spot to go. :)"
3GieJdObr5TOddnFb1AMdA,3,"During my first stay in Vegas I knew I needed to plan out where I wanted to fine dine. After combing through many reviews I made a reservation at  Scarpetta a week in advance. The three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. Our table looked out to the Bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined. 

Great disappointment fell over me as I began to eat the Farmer's Market Salad. Beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies BUT unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned. 

We both ordered pasta dishes. My bf the duck foie gras ravioli and I the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pasta itself was light and delicious. The Marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. However, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful. 
 

I'm glad I tried Scarpetta but based on this visit not sure I would be willing to give it another opportunity to disappoint."
9km7LyyufD15WGZY2rn55Q,5,I love this place!  Come here after the gym all the time.  They have delicious healthy food options and protein shakes.  They can be a little pricey and take a few minutes to serve up your order but that's the price you pay for freshly cooked healthy food and it's definitely worth it!
XyL1VujqSekWDbKYdPcv4w,5,"I've only eaten here once, but I cannot wait for a return trip to Phoenix for a do-over! I had the chimichanga with ground beef and the works. It was EXCELLENT!"

UVsy-l1ZPmO5DYaHLCFURA,1,"Will not come back again, food is decent but they have this rule of ""thai tea free refill but no leftover to-go"" which I understand they dont want ppl keep on refills the drink and get it to-go. I ordered a Thai ice coffee and ate lunch there, and I didnt drank it cuz I wanted to take it to work, when we were paying I asked for the togo cup since I know i didnt refill my coffee at all. She says ""sorry we dont do to-go cup"", and she knew I barely drank my coffee. So I had to finish my coffee when we were paying. Stupidest policy ever."
IYQt75Fbyw7Ly3-DZ9gkCw,5,"followed Philip here from his place on the west side, and I live in Cave Creek which alone should say something about how awesome he is. He's famous for his work with the ladies (check out his website phildoeshair) but does a great job with balding men such as myself. I didn't see the salon before Deborah took over but it appears nearly all the negative reviews are prior to her running the place."
UTMtxEO_3DVf-0fRPyD3Cg,5,"Had to redo the dust cover on the box spring of my queen size mattress set. This was the only place out of three that I called that had that unique black fabric in the size that I needed. As others have suggested, they're really organized with a huge selection and the employees that I've dealt with all were knowledgable and helpful. I'll be continuing to patronize this local small business for my fabric/upholstery needs, as few and far between as they may be, from now on."
shvvAIMbSBaRTg19xQPMJw,1,"My coworker and I went to the King St location and it was packed to the gills. After being told there were 5 groups in front of us and the wait time was unknown, we were informed that they had another location with 2 floors, just a 6 minute walk away. When we arrived, the entire first floor was empty...apparently they were only serving people  on the second floor. We get up and are told to sit wherever we'd like. After sitting down, we are asked if we can sit at another table, because they would like to sit a group of 4 using one of the tables. We look through the beer menu and choose a beer. We then look through their very limited food menu and choose. As soon as my coworker says what he would like, she says they are out of it. He then quickly chooses to avoid an even longer wait time. We both go with a sandwich with a side salad. When the food arrives, he ends up with fries instead of the salad. Little did he know, he lucked out. This was the worst salad I have ever had. Without being informed, I was given a beet, kale, and pinto bean salad. When the check comes, we ask to split it down the middle, but because of the very loud music, she does not here this request. After being informed of the error, she obnoxiously asks if she has to split it. When it is time for us to swipe our cards, our server watches us enter the tip in the credit card device. Overall, this was a questionable choice for dinner."
4Qs43ISopCGVugyJLNGuZg,1,"1. Super messy
2. Many things not in stock
3. No one offered to help, even though it was not busy (11 am on Thursday), and one employee was wandering around putting lipstick on herself, two employees were chatting
4. No Sunday Riley products that I could find
5. Did I mention messy looking? 
6. Many products were sticky and super dusty boxes."

6Bz6jOPAtZzNwsHq4xhZsQ,1,"We walked in several days ago to enjoy some lunch on the patio.  There was no hostess, so after waiting a few minutes, we seated ourselves at one of the two empty tables.  Neither had been cleared from the previous guests.  We waited about ten minutes, but no waitress or bus-staff appeared on the patio, even though it was busy.  Finally, a waitress showed up on the patio and helped a couple of tables.  As she was leaving, without stopping at our table, I asked her if she was our waitress.  She replied there was another person working the patio with her and said ""oh, you haven't been helped yet?""  and left.  We expected someone  to return with menus and to clean the table.  This did not happen, so after five minutes we left.  Management seems to be MIA and the staff appears to be poorly trained.  I can't comment on the food because we were never able to order any, but the service, obviously, is horrible."
l4kw4mQV3qCSWUODMb31YA,4,"I'm a regular at My Sushi. Over the past three years, they've been through a renovation, but the food quality and the staff has remained the same. The food is always fresh, and the staff are always friendly. The service could be slow if you're going with a large group. My favorite item on the menu is their spicy tempura mushroom. The rice to fish balance for their rolls its quite good for an AYCE place. I certainly recommend this spot for a sushi fix."
tmnBmRuVSZOAHGr7ORe64Q,3,"Went there today... I forgot why I stopped going and now I remember . The toppings were scarce to none and the price was ridiculous!!! I ordered two large pizzas, both with three toppings. One was a veggie and one meat. I had four dipping sauce and sodas too. Can you imagine how tiny their large is? It was enough to feed only two people. I ordered more pizza from a place down the street and got four pizzas for the same price. I ended up spending 79 bucks on just the pizza and drinks. At the other place I paid 50 for 4 pizzas with the same toppings, larger portions and honestly the pizza was not even that good. I give the pizza a 4 stars out of 10 and the overall experience a 2 out of 10. Save your money, go to a high end restaurant and enjoy a nice three course meal and drinks for the same value. Is it worth trying? No... Much better places out there."

Ci1wKayAagOnFweiiJlbtQ,4,Love the food. I ordered take out and they had everything ready in 15 minutes exactly. Would order again for sure. PARKING SUCKS! Park South of the restaurant in the smoke shop area and walk over is my recommendation. A little pricy but taste great.
jQToVAhX54-RliE5K22dtw,1,"Are you serious? This place is terrible. Out of all the places you can go see a movie in Vegas - don't come here! This theater is terrible. The only reason I am giving one star is because I have to, and I guess because my boyfriend and I were 2 of 6 people in the movie we went to here.

No stadium seating. It's 2012. Get stadium seating.

Tiny movie screen, bright annoying overhead lights, seats that are terribly uncomfy, and a sad little snack bar. 

I got a Groupon for buy one get one tickets here. I received the tickets in the mail and decided to see Act of Valor. When I arrived at the theater I was greeted with the fact that I had to shell out $1.50 extra per ticket because I was seeing a movie that was less than 2 weeks old. Gee, thanks AMC and GROUPON. See if I ever use your services again."
WcDYzhp4lqLvJCHx577FQQ,1,"Service bad, manager rude and aggressive....my friends and I got there before it opened. Once in side manager was rude and said sit down. Once at a table it took half an hour to order drinks and food. Once drinks were ordered it took another half hour for our drinks. Still waited another half hour for food. Finally some of our group walked out and complained to the manager. When complaining to manager, manager got aggressive and in the face of patron. Would not go back due to service and management."

CROOKS...I almost forgot there adds say $500 down for all,read fine print, it's $500 plus $999 for the tags and taxes so you need $1500 as a minimum down to drive away unless you pay them the other $1000 the next week...as I said ripoffs and crooks"
LUAZbnkEiYQYFWLYUsz38g,4,"Got turned on to this restaurant through a Groupon deal a couple of years ago. Each time we go I think it gets better.  for the most part we have very satisfying meals and experiences here.  The service is good, the staff is friendly, the food is hot and fresh and I always get enough food for leftovers. The hibachi dinners are always filled with lots of yummy, fresh veggies and lots of meat. I'm a veggie person so I find this to be a good ratio of veggies to meat. Some places skimp on veggies but not here. I also like this place especially well because it's one of the few hibachi dinnerplaces that I've visited that  serves fried rice AND noodles.  And how I love the noodles! The order that the hibachi dinner is cooked and the speed in which it is cooked  means that nothing gets cold while you're waiting to eat everything together and that is important to me. I always get some sushi when here and it's one place around that I think has some good sushi for the area. We're not drinkers so I can't comment on the alcoholic beverages.

On the last visit we had 5 adults and a 4 year old.  the hibachi chef wowed the youngest of the group with fire and tricks while cooking our meals! The adults of the group got saki from a  squeeze bottle to keep them busy and entertained! We each got something different for our hibachi meat choice... chicken, salmon, steak, and combo. They were all great. We ordered a couple of sushi items and traded around. There was nothing left of the sushi by the time the meals were served.  I can't say there was anything negative about our last visit or two.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant if you are int he area."
ch5ihrRHx9Xj0xSrJhEHLQ,5,"Pretty freakin awesome! My group went on the happy hour pod for $35 on Saturday night which was all you can drink. Surprisingly enough it wasn't packed at all. We got right to the front and went on immediately. It took about 35 minutes to go around once which is plenty of time to view the strip and catch a buzz. Inside was a small bar with a bartender making drinks quickly. All you can drink means my group was drinking fast! The drinks were kind of weak but we kept sucking them down trying to get our money's worth of drinks. Good music inside, benches to sit, awesome views, what more do you need?!"
W__mwPwy9-T7V7hsCIq5eQ,5,"This is an excellent barbershop. Regular haircuts are $18 cash only, and they have an ATM in the building. It seems this place has exploded in popularity since I've been going, so I recommend making a reservation a couple weeks out via the Vagaro app. I make my reservations for after I get off work and they usually don't take any walk-ins that late in the day. I would imagine it's not as busy during early/mid afternoon. Joe (the owner) cuts my hair and I've been very pleased with it."
B-q-x7-gfCckTvYGuTFVmA,4,"The Franklin Inn is a pretty weird spot, it's in a neighborhood. The food is pretty good. It's always busy which is a good sign of the quality of the food. The margaritas are awesome and the food  portions are pretty  large. I wish that they would have an option for a smaller amount of queso because I end up eating the whole bowl full. Get the taco salad"
G6R86sc5J_M-3yfNDL9pzA,4,"I am a huge fan!!!!  Came in here on a Saturday in need of a pedicure before a vacation (well according to my husband I was in desperate need). From the outside it thought it was just one of your normal plaza mani/pedi  places however when you walk inside it is definitely more of a spa with tranquil music a wall waterfall greeting you. They were able to take me immediately. 
One of the best things was that they didn't try to small talk during it. Which is great for an introvert like me and made the experience even more relaxing. 
   Also they didn't judge me for not having a pedicure in over a year!
  Thank you for a wonderful relaxing Saturday morning before a crazy vacation. I will be here again"
R4DYvqJWI1xvLO4Ih4r-7A,4,"Stopped by here randomly for lunch this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised!  The pizza was actually really good.  My 3 cousins and I split a large pizza with half/half toppings and it came out exactly as we ordered.  It was pretty greasy but c'mon... it's pizza!  It's supposed to be greasy!  

The crust was really good as well.  Nice and Crispy!  We also had the Calamari to start which was also pretty good.  

I got to try a bit of the bloody mary which was 'mehh' to 'just ok'.  Service was decent although we did have to ask for our sides of ranch twice.  

I would definitely come back here!"
BPZ7Umb2jnRu5ForZGAqGQ,5,"This place was the only good and affordable place we were able to find in the las Vegas location. She was willing to work with our budget and their easy financing made it even better. We got a mini golden doodle that turned out to be a very hyper and playful puppy. Until this day he is a very healthy puppy
They had a variety of puppies as well which some were even potty trained 
I do recommend this place if you're looking to buy a pet, and as a new dog owner I definitely recommend it!!"
gpkNGqMR4RvgVxF4bAGKwA,1,"God help you if you need to do a return.  Over a week and just got a response that they received the merchandise back.  Then they charged me $7.99 for handling and still no word of when I'm getting my replacement merchandise.

What clothing retailer charges for returns in this day & age?  This one.

What retailer takes over a week to return something into stock?  This one.

Cannot report on the quality of the merchandise yet since I had to return the pants after receiving them for a sizing issue."
4lslLHM8npTT64epgO8ngA,4,"First time here today, and it was overall a good experience. I came towards the end of the day and they were super busy. They took me within 30 minutes. In the beginning of the appointment I told him I wanted a butterfly design and he said no problem he would get someone to do it for me. Unfortunately, he forgot and i didn't get my design. This disappointed me. But maybe he was having a long day, still he should have listened and remembered I think, right? That was my only complaint.
However, i really appreciated that they stayed after their closing time to finish mine and my friends nails. That was very nice of them. 

This is a very clean place with friendly staff, and they have tons of polish options. Good place to go to, but if you want a design done I would recommend going to a female manicurist."
vQ9T1TT7l0qvckGFHH2V7A,5,"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and so glad we came here. The hot dogs are top notch, the chicken ""o"" club is awesome and the fries are some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend coming to this spot. The owner and staff are super friendly, if I come back to Pittsburgh I'll definitely be coming back here."
RTUgAmNi2spXoYvMcOemIA,2,"This is still one of my favorite places, but I had to deduct a start because it's unbearably hot in there. Las Vegas is the wrong place to be cheap with air conditioning.  It's difficult to sit in that heat and eat. And I can't imagine how bad it is for the employees.  Terrible."
twdy8B6UFYQxU0iBCwpe9g,5,I've been going to this store for a few years now even dating back to when they were a small store in Henderson.  I've never purchased a firearm from them but have allowed my FFL transfers to be sent here with no problems.  I mainly buy my gun accessories here but have referred friends to buy from them.
AwmvXkYYR5zSQT9c8PdAOw,3,"There's something quaint about this place.  Maybe it makes me think that I'm in a joint in Chicago...which I only fantasize about since I never have time to travel.  Also, I really want businesses in my neighborhood to thrive, and oh, there are so many closed up buildings.  It's sad.  So I've been to this place a couple of times, with a complete open mind.  I'm going to like it, I'm going to like it.  And yes, I like it.  I like their burgers, I like their dogs.  My kids like the fries too.  It's not the best, it's not the worse.  But yes, for the love of food, work on your customer service.  I've never had as bad of an experience as some of the other posters, but I have to agree that for fast food they are pretty slow.  They are getting better, but their customer service never strikes me as good.  Nobody in there looks like they are in a great mood.  And it's not because they work at a fast food place...go down the road to Taco Bell or Carls Jr and there's some pretty friendly staff there.  I don't know what it is, but please work on it, I don't want another empty restaurant in my neighborhood!"
_Dqyjb2C-en5S4GMgA0X0A,1,"horrible horrible... I am visiting from California... i order my drinks they way i always order them.. i get told she didnt charge you next time you should say an add shot... no... when i say affogatto at any Starbucks they know its a floating shot of expresso on top of the drink... how about teach your staff!! to add more to the situation drinks were made wrong... i told the ordering person how i wanted the damn drink and they screwed it up... now im telling the barista the correct way and apparently she couldn't understand maybe next time ill speak in layman's terms (more simple context)... and to sit there and tell the person out loud what she is doing wrong is also wrong, learn to pull the person to the side and speak to them in a professional manner... and waiting 9 minutes to order and 10 minutes for drinks is also ridiculous... everyone looked clueless in this store... God knows I can't wait to get home to get back to the competent staff at Starbucks in California"
iMbgFI3YRltizk7YXKvpbg,3,"I go back and forth about this place... The coffee is great, the breakfast sandwich items are great, the doughnuts....meh.  The quality of doughnuts is average. Good enough to eat, not good enough to crave. Does that make sense?"
PoArmB_i7y4tq023Giq3Fg,4,"On our second trip to A la Folie's Mont Royal location, we decided to have three desserts, since the two we tried on our first trip were so outstanding and left us wanting much, much more. They have a great deal for three picks at $10 (a tarte slice, a macaron, and a ""choux à la crème"", which is a puffy piece of heaven stuffed with heaven with crispy sugary bits on top), which if you think about it is an awesome deal. You'd pay more than $20 for that much dessert in a restaurant, and what A la Folie is offering is vastly superior.

Not to brag, but my husband and I lived in Paris for a year and ate so much pastry his parents almost got mad at us. This is better. IT'S BETTER THAN FRANCE. I feel like that should seal the deal. I don't understand why there isn't a line up out the door. The flavours stand out, the use of quality ingredient (ahem, BUTTER) is evident in the flaky pie crusts, and the presentation is adorable. 

Bring your mom one of their ""délices"" or a box of macarons and become (or remain, as the case my be) her favourite child."

It carries most of the same items that you would see at any other Dollar Tree Stores that you might shop at. There are only a few people who work at this location, so if you need help with anything, or wanted to purchase balloons, you would have to go ask the Cashier at the front of the store. 

Since this is a Very New Location, I'll give another review in a couple months or so...Just to see how or if anything has changed since writing this review."

w02VJ6D9uZ6BY9ue8HEwRw,5,Glad we stumbled in hash house today! Amazing food and the atmosphere is cozy. The real highlight was Alex our waiter.

psWofhwIJOtuJ49aP0Z88w,2,"I foster kittens for a rescue and had to take them to be altered at the AHS yesterday. My husband works close by so we met up and had an early dinner here before the kittens were ready to be picked up. I haven't eaten at any El Pollo Loco restaurants in four years because the last time I did they gave us the wrong order. We threw caution to the wind, mainly because nothing else close looked good.

I ordered the taco salad and my husband got the chicken avocado taco combo. He liked his tacos well enough, but my taco salad was sprinkled with dry, hard pieces of chicken. They were so hard you could tap them on the table and it would make a clicking sound (if it wasn't covered in sauce, that is). I didn't complain, I didn't take it back. I will never again go to El Pollo Loco. I didn't learn my lesson before, serves me right.

I gave it two stars because my husband said his combo was ""meh, it's okay"""
DjmW1Y3KE5choLQN4PJxHQ,4,"ARE THEY OPEN AGAIN YET?

I swear it's been forever since I've seen they closed for the summer. Anyways, hope they are so we can resume going. My husband's family has been going to this place for his entire 30 years of existence so it would be blasphemous to give this place less than 5 stars for the sense of tradition it holds in their family. 

There's not anything I could quite say about their food or decor to set it apart from other Mexican restaurants...but it's just El Charro! You either love it with all your heart or...you're indifferent to the place! lol 

One thing's for sure, you always get your food FAST. They have their system down pat in the back, and I've seen the same servers there for the three years I've been coming to this place. Ryan's seen the same servers since he was a little kid! So they must treat their servers well.

El Charro's will always be a family favorite. It's an oldie but a goodie!"
Tbw9xb4xKFdS_vEsGMdG8w,4,"At Monta Ramen for lunch with my work partner. He warned me about the wait because this place is so popular. I didn't care because I had to get my ramen fix on, and this place is supposed to be the best in town!
1st impressions are good; as the wait list was organized and simple. While waiting, I checked out the menu. Straight forward, delicious sounding dishes/ bowls and sides. I also noticed that the menu is more limited than the Monta Ramen in Henderson (Eastern Ave/ Serene). Not full menu of appetizers...
So at about 1 pm on a Tuesday afternoon, we waited 10 minutes.  Not bad, but I think we got lucky. I ordered the Tonkotsu...added the egg for a little over a buck...and it didn't disappoint!  The broth was flavorful (not just a sodium bomb) and the noodles were just what you'd expect a good noodle shop would produce.  Did I mention the price? $6.95 for bowl.  So good; and hit the spot for my craving. Check this place out if you yearn for good ramen. You won't be disappointed!!"
QR_5dBWPPpSgmzpJi_q-aQ,5,This is top shelf away from the island and my parents kitchen! I never leave hungry and my plate always holds the bones I leave behind from the delicious curry chicken dish. The portion of a small order can make to meals. The food has always been fresh. The staff is inviting a friendly. I'm not trying to balloon the business it will do that on its own. This is an honest look and taste from a man with an honest stomach.  This is by far one of the best restaurants in Toronto in its category hands down. Big  RESPECT to the chefs and staff! Love it! Mi belly always full and everyting nuice!! *****
gHEIsiCcp5-HsfprKut-QQ,5,"Love this place!  Fresh seafood in the valley at a good price is/was hard to find. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon in time for the Bloody Mary bar. I've been looking for a fun, full of goodies, delicious Bloody Mary .  This was it. So on Saturday and Sunday, I believe 11-3  it is available. We then ordered the high tide combo. Loaded with oysters, mussels, clams, 5 large shrimp and 2 king crab legs. Heaven! Our plan was to try a steam pot but we were  to full. We were full, but not to full to share a delicious bread pudding with ice cream. Beware. It's a huge dessert.  Couldn't finish it but brought  half the pudding home .(ate all the ice cream)
Bottom line.... we will return
I must not forget to mention the help. Fun and friendly."
1I2-PYVKsi25M6BGPQs1hA,5,"I am one of the thousands of people that switched to AT&T for the iPhone and I have no regrets.  I used to be with AT&T long ago and then left for the other big company.  However, since coming back I have been very pleased with the service I have received.  There are a few times, when I am not in a major metro area when my coverage is spotty, but for the most part, I have no problems.

As far as this particular location goes, the last two times I have been lucky enough to have Meagan helping me and she is wonderful.  The first time I met her was right after my phone decided to take a bath.  I was eligible for a phone upgrade in 2.5 months, so I really didn't want to spend the money to buy a new iPhone (because why would I get anything else) at full price.  She suggested I take it into the Apple store to see if they would replace it under the warranty, which they usually don't for water damage, but might because of the cracks.  She was right.  They did replace it (because Apple is awesome) and she saved me $400!!  

This last time she helped me with the phone upgrade and was just as kind and helpful as the first time.  She seems very genuine and is full of smiles which makes me feel like she is a friend looking out for me and not someone trying to get the big sale.

It seems like everyone is wondering who is going to switch back to Verizon now that they have the iPhone too.  Well, I will tell anyone that will listen that I am happy with AT&T.  Since coming back two years ago, I have not had a problem with my phone and have had great service.  It is because of people like Meagan that I plan to stay at AT&T.  Well, that and the fact I was grandfathered in with the unlimited data package! =)"
MNRZDwvZ1t7ysihLoEUTTw,1,"I've already left my thoughts on this location. And I will reiterate, just start calling this location, ""Walmart""...because it is very clear that the employees and management team cannot hold up to what Target's standards are supposed to be. 

I avoid this Target at all costs if need be, you can smell the bathrooms that are located in the front of the store all the way in the back of the store. It's dirty, it's unorganized. I've said enough.

I'm re-writing this review because of the experience I had yesterday evening with an associate, Carlo. 

Yesterday evening I brought my son (who is 18 months old) in for a quick errand. We stopped by the bargain section and I let him pick out a sippy cup.

At checkout, I was speaking to the cashier (Carlo) about a price check - which he already had an attitude with me. 

Before I continue let me just point out that I am pretty well mannered, I have my child under control and I'm a normal person, not doing anything to deserve this attitude. 

While speaking with Carlo, my son, WHO IS 18 MONTHS. Is trying to hand him the sippy cup to scan it, he's not screaming or crying or tempering, just reaching the cup towards him that doesn't even reach up half way to his chest. 

Mid-conversation, Carlo grabs my son's wrist and yanks the sippy cup out of his hand like he was holding a firework and did something wrong.

Admittedly, I have never had something like this happen with my son. Ever. So I didn't even react, I was just in shock. He didn't say anything, scoffed at me, didn't thank me at the end, say have a nice night, nothing.

I left the store embarrassed and in shock thinking I did something wrong as a parent. I considered calling management but thought I was overreacting. Took some time to really think of it and thought, in no way was it moral of this employee to put his hand on my son like that. Even if he was being a brat (which let me remind you, he wasn't). That's not your kid, that's not your job. YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON A CUSTOMER'S CHILD FORCEFULLY. 


I contacted the store after thinking and was unable to get a hold of a manager. Shocker. 

That was it for me, never coming to this Walmart again. And I hope I never see Carlo out of his place of employment.

IZURYRx8yEou1MUlHwFmcQ,3,"About a month ago, I went to Aiello's Pizza.  I decided to join the crowd and wait to write the review until I tried Mineo's.  This was an interesting tactic, as I usually write reviews pretty quickly and just save them as drafts if I don't want to post them immediately.  So this is what was special about Aiello's:

I don't really remember.

The pizza wasn't great and the pizza wasn't bad.  The crust was a medium thickness with a sweeter sauce and not as much cheese as I like.  I remember thinking that around $20 for a large cheese pizza seemed like too much.  As I was moving the day I got the pizza, delivery would have been really nice.  The storefront was standard pizza store.  But, kids, that's it.

Would I come back here?  Probably.  I might try the specialty pizzas or just order some different kinds by the slice.  But I just didn't think Aiello's was anything to write home about.

Gc4kUWv5E1uPxuuE3aJFKw,3,"First let me say that this part of downtown Chandler is really cool and I was excited to try the Urban Tea Loft. I am a tea NUT and so I was planning to host a brunch for a girlfriend of mine who is getting married here. Judging from the website this looked like a really special place, so I went to go check it out before I made a reservation.
The space is beautiful and the furnishings are top knotch ...and that is where the compliments end. 
I arrived with a friend at 10:15 in the morning on a Saturday. It was us and one other table of two.The place was understaffed and things looked discombulated. There  was one waitress in the whole place which would have been fine if she was experienced and didnt have 10 stitches in her hand from a dishwashing accident a few days before..every plate she carried and tea pot she brought out she was clearly in agony..... but the food was good. The cook was awesome! Very friendly (I met him because he had to come out of the kitchen to help deliver food and clear dishes..). I got a little pissed though when a person who appeared to be the owner arrived and walked around for a second and then disappeared..The girl needed a little help out there..
Dont go here if you expect to find a new tea, have conversation with someone who knows about tea or to buy tea or any accessories. It does not appear that the staff or owners have any knowledge in this regard or know what a tea enthusiast would expect from a place named the Urban Tea Loft.At least that was the impression I got from my visit. I would suggest that the owner take a trip with her employees to even the local Teavana store to observe the employees knowledge and enthusiasm and the items available for purchase. 
That said this place has SO much potential and I really hope that the owners get it together!"

I don't really have too many complaints except that it always smells funny, like they need some glade air fresheners or something. Security lines can be hit or miss depending on what time you go but for the most part, it is a pretty decent airport. I mean the best part, besides getting to your destination is the people watching. I swear the things I have seen and heard could make for a funny sitcom or book someday.. hmmmm..."

dcFbCN5_v4lMrxWexP9Arw,5,"Had dinner here last night and was thoughoghly impressed. The atmosphere is really comfortable in comparison with the menu items. Hostesses at the front were welcoming as was the entire staff. 
Was served by Kristin and she went above and beyond to be sure our needs were met. Never had a low drink or dirty plate on the table. When we were seated, I believe the table behind us had asked to speak to a manager. She quickly apologised and said she'd be right with us. And she was. She had a smile and warm attitude throughout our dining experience despite a busy evening for the restaurant. She knew the menu items and even offered suggestions. 
The food was phenomenal. Our table sampled each other's plates and nothing was bad. I had a pasta dish that was a little bland in comparison to the rest of the table's delicious choices but it was far from being bad. The filet oscar my husband had was delicious!!!
I will, for sure, be a frequent flyer here!"

OMG this is BY FAR the cleanest nicest friendliest best laundromat in Union County. First of all, only 1 machine in the entire place was out of order (for comparison, in every laundromat in Monroe, at least half the machines are broken, the rest eat your change or barely work), all the machines were clean, obviously well maintained, very reasonably priced (giant $6 washer holds 3 big blue ikea bags full of clothes FYI). They have nice touches like arcade games (my kid was enthralled by Ms Pac Man), vending machines. 

But by far, the best part was the outstanding service from Robin, the owner's new bride. Such a sweet heart! She was so incredibly helpful and kind. What a nice place, they blow the competition away!"
TLx76oYe46dKlpU4nxtneg,2,The food was decent but the coupon code for a44oz margarita for $9 on this website did not work.  They told me they couldn't give me that discount. I felt ripped off because it is advertised right here on Yelp.

The second time I tried to come and they would not allow me to use a Living Social coupon I had purchased. This place is a scam.

-wR14SUJny0ge-aGcsRV4A,5,"Very unassuming place from the outside, it was right across the street from where I was staying, on a Saturday there was a huge line around 7pm, thought maybe it was a bar. Looked it up and to my delight a very well rated italian resto!

Ordered takeout, eggplant parm/vegie lasagna/white pizza. Their white pizza looked amazing, got great reviews, so i went with that. Walked into the place and was instantly hit with the sweet sweet smell of an AMAZING Italian food kitchen. You only get that smell at primo places, I was happy before even getting my food.

Tip #1 -  this place is CASH ONLY. Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall seeing this on their website nor menu, But their is an ATM there.

The food is AMAZING, everything tasted great, was so damn delicious. The pizza is the unique offering -  IMO I think they use a shortening in their dough which gives the crust a semi semi puff pastry texture/flavor. It was really unique and appreciated, and especially on the white pie it went very well.

I would come from anywhere in the city to eat here, but if you're staying at the Trylon appts across the street this is a big plus being so close.

Great job Amelia's, please open another location in Toronto!"

The pastas are okay, they come in small portions but with an expensive price which I'm not very happy about."

6uSz9avrNXYAJkOHn1i5_w,5,"Review: dinner.

I've been to The Himalayan numerous times since I moved to Calgary and it has been my favorite for years now. I won't do it justice if I don't talk about them.

Bottomline: small boutique restaurant that serves consistent phenomenal flavorful food unique to Calgary. Definitely a must try.

Atmosphere: located on the west end of 17th Ave, this little gem is tucked away in one of the strip malls and easy to miss. Place is constantly busy so make sure to make a reso at least a week ahead of time.

Food: I've been to the restaurant numerous times and have tried almost everything on the menu. There's yet a dish that has disappointed me so far. Everything has great deep flavors and balanced very well. The chef is able to combine Asian cuisine with Indian spices like peanut butter and jam. The end result is something very unique and delicious. Oh and did I mention every table starts off with a light plate of homemade chips and dips? Awesome way to segue into the appys and entrees.

Value: fantastic food at a fantastic price. Considering the quality and taste, this place has everyone beat in regards to price. Expect fine quality food at an affordable price."

DJpP0U13Em8ufXCJNpphuw,4,"What a little treasure of a place just hidden away. The sign outside does it no justice. I drove by this place sooooo many times and never thought about going in. One day, out of no where, after a gym workout (ironically) I decided to stop in.

I was in sweet heaven, so many cakes, cookies, etc, i didnt know what to do with myself. So i did what any normal person would, I got almost one of each little piece of cake. One of my favorites is the key lime tart, its delicious and just the right amount of sweetness. Yes, it did get a little pricey, but totally worth it. 

Stop in, get a cake, and be happy :)"
cDlHqPCWy7DFJCV1zRv6kw,4,"This a good spot, the atmosphere is usually good, and the food is mostly always fresh. The fajitas are off the hook, and they have lots of great appetizers. I'm a huge fan of the Southern Smokehouse burger, and the Honey Chipotle ribs are a must try. All in all it's good neighborhood restaurant/bar to bring the friends or family."
VRhgpQEEUEXQ5f5eMCWWcw,1,"Such a disappointment from a place I once really liked.  I remember when Tupelo Honey first opened, and the wait was two hours for a table.  Sadly, I don't think that's the case any longer.

We went for a birthday dinner - reservations for a large party at 7:00 - and were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly and funny, but clearly overworked by having to serve our large party, as well as other nearby tables (perhaps they were short-staffed this particular night??).  That being said, the service was abysmally slow - from drink orders to hot biscuits to the actual dinner to bringing our checks.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but it was clear that the kitchen was slammed - and the managers I observed were spending more time chastising their staff than being helpful (and this was in very plain sight).

My food (burger) was quite good, but I heard several comments from others that their food was just okay.  One guest ordered the roasted beet salad, which, when it arrived, had only about three tiny pieces of  beet in and zero goat cheese.  He very quietly and calmly requested the server take it back and send out the salad as described on the menu.  He got his new salad all right, but he also got a manager with what I perceived as an attitude - questioning him about why he sent it back in a very antagonistic tone.  Not well played, Tupelo Honey, not well played.

We arrived at 7:00 and left at 9:30 - not because we were having so much fun (although we were) but because the service was so very slow - the wait to get our checks and, once we had them, the wait to have them picked up and returned for signatures, was totally ridiculous. 

I think I will only return to Tupelo Honey if someone I particularly care for insists that no other place will do - and, even then, I will try to change their minds!"
S-UzDUEwfkeTiZTV07G6Hg,5,I visited Barbie here for the 2nd time!  I love my hair!  She is a color specialist and i love that they use Paul Mitchel products.   I even bought some lightweight hair oil-smells so good!  I got a great cut and feel amazing!  I'm so glad I found this place as well as Barbie!
-OrKy6G-XcXm6vnh_t-C9w,3,"Maybe I've been spoiled by working on cruise ships and enjoying 5 course meals for a whopping $20.  In this time I've learned a lot about food and was excited to take my girlfriend to Switch.  We got in at 6:30 which may have been a bad idea because it's very early... too early for vegas standard... We were seated, and the waiter was very attentive and referred to me by Mr. ....  He hovered a little bit but being as there were so few people, I didn't mind.  He had a good product knowledge as well.  We got in and ordered within 10 minutes and had our food delivered literally within about 8 minutes after that. Too soon. Great food though... I don't mind paying prices like that considering it IS in the Encore, and it IS on the strip... so no big deal... successful early 20's couple,  appreciates a good meal, but HERE was the big problem....  

We couldn't even TRY to extend our meal over an hour... we were in at 6:30, out at 7:45 after desert... and in that time, the place switched twice... every half hour, but the ceiling was a) either broken, or b) they don't change it that early in the night.... so basically the whole reason was to see this dramatic switch, the music GOT SUPER LOUDDDD... ANDD!!!!!  A LITTLE WALL ROSE FROM THE SIDE WALL... 

AND A HALF HOUR LATERRR!!!!! THE WALLL WENT BACK DOWN!!!!

It was good food... again... 45 bucks a plate for a place that is supposed to give you an 'experience' and is on the strip and in the encore seems reasonable.... but we just didn't get the experience. :(

I don't NOT recommend this place, I think it's great, as long as the cieling is working...."

- excellent service 
- friendly 
- wait time for 2 is only about 10min and they text you when the seat is ready 
- -1 star bc it's too much for me. What's too much? It's literally heart stopper with high calorie and there's no fruit/salad. Better, cheese, mayo... lots of salt.. you'd like it if you're into that kind of stuff. Not my favorite. I won't order California crepe again. Potatoes are good, again it's very salty.  


What we ordered 
- California crepe with bacon mushroom and cheese 
- banana muffin from Yelp check in 
- classic eggs Benedict 
- lemonade 
- coffee

Now I like it when my drinks are unlimited refill so I'd recommend it!"
UmW2tbxWaK-5wOz-kgJhcA,1,"**REGULAR CUSTOMER DISAPPOINTED** Customer Service needs to be worked on BIG TIME! 

My scenario as I write this. I've been here since 10am this morning and bought 2 pumpkin spiced lattes, 2 hot chocolates, a plain bagel, iced coffee, Chocolate chip scone (brought my older daughters with me & my husband) and we've been sitting enjoying the shop and doing some work.  The girl mixed up our drinks but we figured it out after a couple of sips. 

Lunchtime rolls around...getting hungry lol and I place an order with ARI(?) for a medium iced tea and THE CARLOS sandwich at 12:55pm and received my food at 1:23pm. 28 MINUTES LATER!! No word until I walked up front and she saw me, then said it would be a few more minutes. When she brought my food, she had her head down the whole time and whispered, ""You're Welcome"".. which I didn't hear but my husband said she did. He pointed out the fact that  she didn't apologize for the long wait, or mention it at all and didn't even smile when she put the food down on the table and quickly walked away. 

I'm fed up, that's why I'm writing this. I don't think we'll come back. There are other options. It just seems to me that these girls that work here are in their own world and just collecting a paycheck.  No effort to do things right. They don't write down the orders, so if they are inundated with orders, or get a lot of people in drive-thru and in shop...that's not a good thing. They don't pay attention to detail and if the owners not here, that's very evident in all aspects. No music playing, dishes on table, floors dirty, attitudes, etc. 

I believe I've been very fair & honest as my first review here was five stars and I've been REALLY trying hard to make it work because I see the potential of where this shop could go in So Highlands but if they don't care, then I guess I don't either. I'm out."

GhglRPkD8t4frqCKmj0q7A,3,"My first time here and I'm excited that The Vig has finally come to (sort of) North Scottsdale. The ambience is great except...the bar stools are stationary and neither move, swivel or have backs on them.  They are very very very uncomfortable and need to be replaced immediately. Also, I understand and get that bars and restaurant need and like to have TV's in the bar ( during events I like them as well) but their TV's are quite large and take away from the ambiance that they could have. The TV doesn't ALWAYS need to be on. All in all I  will come back because the food in good and the ambiance is nice and its in the hood."

1n_7_RPt_-scJlLtosEUxA,1,"I have gone to the NextCare on Northern a number of times and each time I've been very happy with the service but this location is NOT pleasant.

First, we walked in the door to be blasted with the heat of the office.  It's 50 degrees outside and 85 inside.  If that is not bad enough the African American girl behind the desk was a smoker and you could smell her from the front door.  The stench was so strong I had to keep leaving the waiting room because of the cigarette odor.  To make things worse, she got up twice during the time I was waiting and went  outside to smoke more, so each time she came back in the smell in the room just kept getting worse and worse.  The smell traveled all the way down to the waiting rooms after we got in to see the doctor.  This made the whole location seem disgusting and dirty.

Second, as I said it was hot, oppressively hot.  After that they put myself, my wife and my daughter in a 12 by 12 room and closed the door the heat kept building to the point my daughter started to feel light headed.  When I asked them to at least leave the door open, they said it was against hippa laws to leave the door open.  

The doctor was fine, but when all got home we all had to take a shower and put our clothes straight into the washing machine.  This visit left my family and I completely grossed out.  Not the kind of feeling you want from a medical facility."
KqGXHfS4YwwPTbbBPwVQBg,3,"Not a bad spot, for a restaurant chain that is. 
Always had great service at this location. I worked very close, so I often came here for lunch, and after work gatherings. The bartenders were always the best. Very personable, remember you and your drink (which counts for a lot in my book). I mostly came here for apps/drinks. 
The few times I came here for dinner, the food was ok. Mostly under seasoned, and unimaginative. I found one steak I liked to order that was a safe bet. But steak is usually not why you come to a place called ""Hops"". 
Moving on to their house brewed beer, its not bad. Its not great either. I usually stick to the ""red/amber"" ale here. Can't remember the exact name right now. 
Overall a safe bet for a decent meal at a reasonable price with good service."

Uzx2stpx3Kwx9U1VQ9yvXg,3,"I really like sauce.  Ordinarily I get the sausage and carmelized onion pizza and it is really delicious.  The crust is slightly unconventional, more like a cracker than pizza dough, and very thin, but I consider that an acceptable nuance of their place.

My wife always gets the wild mushroom and truffled arugula pizza and although you know my perspective on arugula (tastes like fart) she insists it is the cornerstone of her very existence (in her words: ""it's really good.""  she understates).

However today I went against all that is good and right with the world and ordered a salad.  Turkey, avocado, and feta salad.  The feta was decent, the avocado was delightful, the turkey was lunch meat turkey cubes.  not a compliment.  The dressing was light and i definitely felt like i was doing something good for my body.

My body was surprised.

Anyway, the salad was a 3 out of five.  Decent, not wonderful.  So the waitress came and said that if I liked that dressing, they have a secret salad with the same dressing and all sorts of italian cold meats in it.  Sounds amazing!  

So I asked her what gives with the secret salad.  Well it is an idea on the part of some of the higher ups to encourage ppl to return to the place and order the salad.  I say, just put your best shit on the menu, otherwise I won't come back.

So I was intrigued.  But do I like being engaged in a cunning ruse to make me return?  no!

So I browbeat the poor hapless waitress for a few minutes about whose idea it was and so on, and then told her I'd never return to sauce so long as i live.

But I will, because that salad sounds tasty as hell.  Plus, with their salads they serve a nice little bread roll which is pretty wonderful.  Also they serve wine and beer and who doesn't like that?"
iJmkQWDGKR0ZI9miXgFL8A,4,"It is pretty much as good as everyone says it is.  The food choices are incredible.  Like, literally my plate was full after I looked at just 1/4 of the food (not including the desserts).  Some of my favorites were the sweet potato tater tots, chips and guacamole, mashed potatoes and gravy and baked beans.  They had really cool stations that I had never seen at another buffet before, such as artisanal cheese.  I would definitely come back because the food was good and there were a TON of options so if you have a party that has picky eaters, they will likely find something up their alley.

The hostess who sat us was also very nice.  When she found out that my sister had been to the buffet before and recommended that I come, she thanked my sister for returning and suggesting I visit.  They have to know that word of mouth marketing is really strong and you can tell that everyone takes their jobs very seriously.  They had more staff on hand (cleaning tables, setting tables, serving, preparing food) than any other buffet.  They are obviously spending a lot of wages, but the quality of that really comes through.  I even asked someone at the dessert station about desserts without nuts and she didn't know she she checked with someone instead of just guessing (as happened to me at other buffets).  That follow up, even if simple, goes a long way with me.

With that being said, the price was ridiculous.  it was $75 for two of us for lunch.  I know they have to charge that much because of the seafood and sushi, but as a girl with simple tastes, my dinner probably only cost them a couple dollars to make, at most.  Considering how shitty all the other buffets were, though, I would gladly spend more to be able to eat here."
JD1TOWD1rc-sNIUhIYs7dg,2,"I have been here twice, and both times I have left disappointed. The service has been nice and friendly, but the food is not very good and not worth the money. 

The burgers were super overcooked and dry. It was as if the patties had been sitting on a grill for too long, and they were way too small for the buns. The cheese was a cold kraft single. For the price, you're better off going somewhere like Peter's. 

The regular fries are okay - they're just frozen McCain crinkle cut, but they were fresh and hot with a nice seasoning spice on them, though a bit dry. However, I seriously would recommend staying away from the chilli cheese fries - covered in gross nacho cheese and left me feeling really bad in my stomach."

My wife got the Garlic Shrimp and it was excellent. The only knock is for the price you don't get a lot of food, better quality than an L&L but you will probably still be hungry and spend more."
T-sV71I9kcnDnGONsUIftw,3,"Average vegan Asian food. Not bad, not terribly tasty. If you like processed protein, you will love this place, because just about every dish serves tofu or veggie protein or yam protein (say wha?). You can however make requests for soy-free and gluten-free. 

It's a nice quiet restaurant painted white inside with several tables set for three or four people. The servers are very lax and friendly. Also the menu is colorful with pictures.

Appetizers:

Rainbow salad - Very light dressing covering a mound of exceptionally thin sliced cabbage and veggies. It's topped with slices of veggie protein but I ate around those. Otherwise, a very good salad.

Spring Rolls - Veggie protein is chopped up and mixed in well enough so that it would take too long to pick out. They looked good, but I avoided them. Tasted the accompanying house made peanut sauce and found it to be very weak.

Dumplings - Also looked very good but the veggie protein was blended in so I avoided them. The accompanying house made sauce was very weak.

French fries - Thinly sliced, fried right, and served with basic ketchup.

Entree:

In order to avoid soy and the processed stuffs, I ordered the broccoli-mushroom dish and made special request for a plain eggplant dish. Either brown or white rice could be requested as an addition to the meal, but I opted for a side of noodles. Glad I did. 

Also, glad I ordered two dishes because ended up combining them into one, just to get a full meal. The mushrooms were awfully rubbery; they went to waste. So I paired the broccoli florets with my eggplant and stirred in the noodles. That was good. 

Beverage:

Orange juice with mint flavor and topped with flowers. I thought the orange was going to be fresh, but it tasted like it was straight from a carton. (That is the last time I believe a server who says the restaurant sells fresh juice.) The mint was an artificially dark green colored overly sweet syrup at the bottom of the glass. Not worth it.

Dessert:

Slice of maple cinnamon cake. A-Okay. Not too thick and not overly sweet. A trained tongue can tell that it's vegan."

Man, I'm lucky to work around the corner from this place (for the past 6 years and I'm just now trying them?!  Shame!!)  I love Pad Thai and I decided to try Satay a few weeks ago.  I ordered Chicken Pad Thai at a heat level of 3.  HOLY BALLS!  A 3 is like an 8 at Pin Kaow.  Much more spicy than I expected, but the flavors were still really delicious and fresh.

After having it for the first time, I crave it once a week!  I have dialed the heat down to 2 and it's a good level (for someone that usually orders a 3 at Pin Kaow).

Delivery had always been fast (I work in Howard Hughes) and the food is piping hot!

The serving size is generous- I always have left overs.

This is definitely a go-to lunch spot/delivery for me. :)"

The crab cakes had so much favour to it, I find alot of places have a hard time seasoning them to perfect but Smash found their magic. 

Spacious environment great for a brunch. I prefer their brunch menu over dinner on regards to options and taste."
XR2y1MavGvjX7ZWz3RDClw,1,"This is by far the poorest excuse for sushi! We happened to be on this side of town and by the other reviews and it being rated 4 stars we thought it was a safe choice.....I was wrong!!! I eat sushi because I like raw FRESH fish. I do not like rolls with deep fried fish, with imitation or fake substitute ingredients, and garnished with 2 oz of spicy mayo. They do not have more than 3 or 4 rolls that don't have some sort of tempura, deep fried, or ""krab"" mix. So the food alone will be reason enough for me to never go back. The service mirrored the food. We had to ask for everything (ex. Ginger, wasabi, soy sauce, refills, check) It got to the point where we felt like we couldn't bother or ask them for anything else. For the price we were charged I could have had sushi at a 5 star restaurant. Being an ex bartender/server I couldn't not tip, but was very hard to tip. DO NOT GO HERE!"
qUXIDp4DAvc_ti-WPDfOZg,1,This place I have been coming to for awhile.. Never have I experienced hair in my food. When the Manager Ramon came out and pertained to tell me that the hair couldn't of came from his employees it came from the outside when people open the door. I couldn't but look at this man and say that is the dumbest excuse I have ever heard of WOW!!! I will not be back to this place it's a joke. Not to add the portion today was four pieces of shrimp one spoon full of rice and beans take was ridiculous expensive if you enjoy blowing money for less food then go to this place. I'm so disappointed overall. I hope the owner Lorenzo reads this and gets back to me.

Bathrooms are clean! !

Chairs for everyone to sit. 

I love that they have a little playground for kids here.  It's nice to let them burn some energy before getting on the plane.  

All workers that I encountered today was very pleasant and in a good mood

Only thing confusing here is the signs when entering the airport."
w61OvCghVwyPqSmiVHs9Cw,4,"Had a good meal at John's tonight. 

Made a reservation for 8pm. Was greeted by a friendly hostess and was sat immediately. He waitress promptly came over and we ordered cocktails. I had a cosmopolitan. A little bit light in the alcohol, which I wasn't surprised about given the previous reviews.

My BF and I ordered
-the crab cake and the oyster po' boy sliders for appetizers. The crab cake was good, came on top of a bed of arugula. I thought it was a small portion though.  There were 3 sliders for the po' boys. They were great.
-had the black cod, tuna blt, and lobster pouting for dinner. Everything was good but the bechemel sauce was a bit runny. 

All in all, a good meal. I will return."
mAuYv7KPsJ8eKpJptOTQcA,2,"Overall I think this store leaves a lot to be wanting.  I always feel like I get different opinions when I go in here.  I wonder if they are having some sort of financial difficulty and when they tell me to go up in size or push a certain shoe it's just really because that's what they have in stock.  There return policy isn't that great and neither are their prices.  Again, I think there is better service and pricing elsewhere in Charlotte."
mm0PXJNLWBO0UXK1E33IsQ,5,I try to order something different each time I go there and everything is so good. The best Taiwanese comfort food in town and I am currently obsessed with their Korean Grapefruit Green Tea drink. The price of food and drinks is very reasonable. Excellent hangout spot with a group of friends and they close late.
UoAhCbIg2i9HokxbNFyHpg,2,"I've been to the Liberty a total of three times:

The first was during restaurant week- the highlight of my meal was a dessert that was a gooey chocolatey cake with a chocolate stout shooter...but its not on their regular menu and that makes me sad. 

The second I went for the Mac N Cheese - which was meh to say the least. I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland. 

Today I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun. This is served with fries, ""dessert"", and soda/Iced Tea. Great deal! 

 The  burger itself was pretty good although I'm not sure I would be back based on that alone. The fries were really good (fresh cut and herby) but when I asked for a side of ranch (don't judge) it was watery blue cheese- ick, and since I'm not a ketchup girl I wished there was a thinner aioli or something just for those...then they would be perfection! 

The dessert was a mean joke- basically they were like a Little Debbie-esque snack pecan pie with wrapping left on. I was really disappointed and wish they just made a fresh cookie or just left it out all together. 

This would have earned 3 stars but our service was terrible.

 Aloof describes our waiter perfectly well. Drinks were left unfilled, he couldn't bother to crack a smile, and he put our checks in the middle of the table (hey we all got the same thing you could have just passed it around to us politely). We had one to-go order which was the special and a salad - this took longer than all of the other meals, even though that was ordered at the same time- she was leaving early so that was definitely a problem...he also failed to mention that he added 20% gratuity- which at $1.70 a piece wasn't a big deal but it's always a bit sketch when they don't say it outright. It seemed like he knew he was getting gratuity added so he didn't bother to be friendly....so -1 star based on service alone."
qxLDJlchl1YmQoM9ph2w7g,2,"Memorial day weekend is a circus in Vegas anyway but that's a whole other story.  The room was dingy and outdated.  I felt like I couldn't touch the shower curtains or walls when I was showering and also wanted to wear shoes in the shower.  I checked for bed bugs and roaches but saw none which was a plus.  The AC made an awful noise that would not be associated with an AC.  Lady at front desk was nice.  Didn't check for evidence of murders like one of the reviewers did which might have been a good thing for us...outta sight, outta mind.  Ghetto characters walking around the parking lot, just mind your own and you'll live.  We had the mentality of most of the other reviewers: no one really stays in their rooms in Vegas and it's cheap and near the strip.  I guess that's what kept us going this weekend, staying out of the room as much as possible.  Despite the feeling of disgust in the room, it wouldn't be a definite ""NO"" but it sure as sh*t that we will be finding other affordable alternatives in Vegas.  

Tip: Avoid the Coco's out front.

Pros: Liquor store within walking distance."
ekdHpPMB7VpCbENB4L7SNw,4,"Stopped in on Saturday afternoon to give it a try. Nice draft selection, hubby got the Columbus IPA and I stuck with a Bud Light bottle. We ordered onion wedges-which were good. The tempura batter was a little gummy on the inside but the bourbon steak sauce for dipping was HEAVEN. I could have skipped the cumin ranch as it didn't mix well with the steak sauce. Hubby had chicken n waffles which was over half gone before I could get my phone out to take a picture--it was really good. He devoured the maple bacon mac n cheese--said it was heavenly. I ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was under a heading of shared plates--definitely not enough to share but I also wouldn't want to. It was a little sad that it wasn't hot (probably so the hubby's waffle could be hot) but it was divine. Lots of lobster and the asparagus was amazing. Great sauce and the pom frittes on top were what made the dish over the moon. A little pricey but definitely a place we will return."
BFLSg6-rtjst5lzHs_6ahg,5,I have been going to Dr. Shawn for about sixteen years now. I absolutely love everyone in the office. I have sent everyone from my grandfather down to my youngest family members there and frequently recommend them to clients when massage therapy isn't enough. I wouldn't send anyone I know anywhere else. Gilbertson's is quality chiropractic care from people I truly trust.
wfQiwtkgjp7cP1biVDuqBQ,3,"Walked in here with as a bridesmaid with her bride on the morning of her wedding for a hairstyling.  The best I can said is that the bride, who wanted a retro up-do, did get what she wanted.  

I, however, found the one and only salon stylist who has no clue how to do a straight blow out.  She literally Did.  Not.  Know.  

Let me start by saying I've got Keratin treated hair and it's actually been within the past two months.  This means I need sulfate-free shampoo and I made sure to bring some of my own (with my own product too just in case) because really, what I wanted was just the blow dry which saves time and effort having someone else do it.  The KEratin makes it all super easy to just blow out.  But not if you got the girl I did.

While washing my ahri she wouldn't stop talking about how she wanted to get some hot rollers heating up for me.  I told her several times she shouldn't need to do anything like that.  All I wanted was the blow dry and maybe help pinning up a flower on one side of my head.

She began with my bangs and started to fluff them, blow dry against the cuticle, and rat with a brush.  I had to stop her and suggest she blow air in the opposite direction to keep it all smooth.  She warned me I wouldn't get any volume that way.  I explained again to her that I paid several hundred $ to get the volume and curl all out of my hair and that I wanted smooth and sleep and straight and that there was zero desire for volume.  She, with her 4inch-plus-ratted-hair-from-scalp-look, said she couldn't believe that because she could just make it look ""so purty"".

I normally wouldn't mock someone else's hair style so badly but when they work in the industry and refuse to listen to instructions on how to do the most simple of all salon styling procedures?  It's on.  

After offering her more tips (use the round brush to hold the hair and help heat the hair with the dryer blowing on the brush), she had got maybe 1/8 of hair dry when she turned off the blow dryer and announced she had to then go wash out another client's color.  

My hair was drying and frizzing (despite the Keratin!) right before my eyes since it wasn't getting proper heat drying!    I was near tears and had to go to the bathroom to calm myself down (reminded myself at least my friend the bride was getting the style she wanted and worst case was I had to wash and do my own hair all over).  

When I got my stylist's attention again I told her I was worried that she was letting my hair dry and frizz and reminded her that this took me abut 30 minutes to do, 20 mins if I went to salon (which I've done several times) and we were running past 45 minutes.  She told me she just wanted me to let her do it her way.  To me, this is absolutely unacceptable.  I pay to my hair done how I want it.  

My friend the bride finished her up do long before mine was even half dry and I knew I just needed to get out of the chair but not before the receptionist came over to inquire from my stylist how much to charge.  And then I got to listen in on my stylist whining that is was a very difficult case since I had treated hair (which should have made the blow dry talk half the time anyone else with the same amount of hair but that's only if one understands the concept of a blow straight).  I bit my tongue and didn't point out I had to bring all my own product and wasn't getting virtually any service whatsoever and just let her ramble on and decide to charge $35 for a butchery of a blow out.  

Final story?  This salon was a very terrible experience.  I'm appalled at the lacking experience and attitude from the stylist I had and disappointed in the lack of anyone intervening from the salon when it must have been obvious the stylist assigned to me was inadequately skilled to meet my needs. 

Do Not Recommend.  Unless you like the Texas big hair Dynasty look.  Then it's perfect."

G_4t5LB3ZPmxQfF9XG-nGg,5,"I've been dying to try Pei Wei, but there normally just isn't one close to me. When we had 15 minutes before our flight was boarding, I somehow still convinced the husband we could swing it. When we were up, I asked the cashier how long it would take for a honey shrimp. I was happy that she took the time to ask the manager just to be sure.. and she told us 10 minutes. We paid extra for the fried rice and planned to split the entree between us. 10 minutes for our order to be up was spot on! Super happy for the quick turnaround and they even put plenty of napkins and enough silverware in the bag. Score. Now we get to be those jerks on the plane with the delicious smelling food. Ha! The honey shrimp was SO good. It has been awhile since I've been to a P.F. Chang's, but I would only order the crispy honey shrimp there and this was, I believe, the exact same (they are owned by the same company). Delicious and cooked to order. Loved it! A great, quick find in an airport and a happy change from candied nuts and McDonald's!"
YXcd55pDJ7xenrxSaL0U5A,2,"My first ... and prolly my LAST visit.

Thought I would try something new and different for dinner tonight.... (never been to a Salsaritas).

Went to the line to order. As i went down the line I ordered Steak.  The guy said ""That's gonna be a little extra"".  I said, "" that's OK"".   Then i asked for peppers and onions..... ""That's gonna be a little extra"".   Um,  ""OK"".  ......"" I would also like Chips and Guac please"".   He says....""OK, that's gonna be a little extra"".   I said, ""well, of course it is.  I would expect nothing less.""  

I get to the register and ran up a $15 bill.  Looked at the small portion i got for $15 and thought to myself....""i hope this is at least somewhat good.""

It was less than mediocre.  The steak was dry, the queso tasted like sanitizer, the chips were way over salted.  About the only thing that tasted good was the Sweet Tea.

Also, how can they justify $1.50 more for 1 small scoop of Sautéed peppers and onions.  I mean hell, you can get 1 green Pepper and 2 onions for that price at the grocery.

Basically, this is an overpriced fast food Mexican joint lacking a lot of taste to be desired.

Sorry Salsaritas. ....you better up your game for the price."
0l2EFmEDS93za2Vdmn32vg,5,"While we live within walking distance of Ultra Star, I am more than happy to drive the 8 miles out of my way to come to this theater. It's always bright, always clean, and the staff of able-teenagers is always polite. I do like my teenage employee peeps to be polite and make eye contact with the customers and Harkins does seem to train these kids right!

I love the discounts offered at the snack bar for frequent movie goers. I love that the theaters are clean after every showing. I love that the seats are comfortable and the sound is just right. 

While Harkins can't be held accountable for the few idiots that venture out to go to the movies and have to provide their own subtext to the movie going experience, Harkins is responsible for every other part of my experience and I have yet to be disappointed when I go to this theater."

They had a great accoustic singer who started in the afternoon but got talked into playing into the evening... he was fantastic.

The atmosphere is pretty bare-bones, which is nice.  A long picnic table, some bar tables and some covered outdoor seating that I cannot wait to try.  It was COLD in there, my husband wore his coat and I used mine as a blanket... 

The service is friendly.  The crowd, as usual for NODA, is ecclectic and fun, friendly and non-pretentious.  They also offer a 1/2 gallon fill-up to go, or to enjoy on-site, which was a great price at $14.

Bonus: they serve peanuts."
iNAVJ9vPqrqsF7QooCOexA,5,I rented the bus for a family reunion and it was the highlight of our trip!

Highly recommended!!
3q-N_5rJwLFipdP5Pp-OsQ,4,"These guys don't need any more positive reviews. The existing ones speak for themselves.   That said, I had such a fantastic experience here today, I had to share another 5 star review.

Was out on business with my biz partner and we were a bit out of our 'hood and our element, so the biz partner looked up local restos with free WiFi and stumbled upon this lovely nook of a sammie joint.   Glad she did.  

First off, just like it says on their website, they are a bit hard to find. The location is nestled away on the NW corner of 90th Street & Via Linda.  They're in a shopping center with a Fry's and an assortment of spa & wellness boutiques and a DVD conversion place.  The location is small, cozy, and eccentrically decorated like a slice of Vermont-icana (if that's even a word), with chill retro tunes playing and nods to ""The Dead"" and hippie-ish verbiage on their menu, which leads me to the food...

The food was AMAZING!  Based on some other Yelp reviews,  I got the Long Trail.  It was great!  Fresh, fresh, fresh with homemade condiments and tons of fresh veggies.  It came with a choice of salad (I chose pasta), and I also added a cup of deliciously chilled squash soup, in the style of a Vichyssoise or gazpacho.  Pure, chilled perfection.  My biz partner had a chicken salad wrap (The Deadhead) that was completely over-the-top delicious! We swapped bites of our respective lunches but I was unable to convince her to do tradesies on the second halves of our individual sandwiches.  Hers was amazing and on my target list of the next visit.  We also sampled and then bought an AMAZING fresh maple-chocolate chip cookie that blew my mind!  I'd bathe in that recipe!!

The best part of the experience was the staff.  We got there towards the end of the lunch rush and once the place cleared out and settled down a little, the owners generously took time to engage us in genuine conversation.  They are exquisitely down-to-earth, authentically nice and completely friendly, affable and accommodating.  We talked about everything from history to digital marketing to high school with them.  It was kinda like having lunch with old friends -- who we just met!!!  

Totally sweet people and I wish them the best of success.  If they continue to run & build their business as they have been doing, there's no doubt in my mind they'll take the Vermont Sandwich Company anywhere they want it to go.  They deserve it; fresh, ample portions, fantastic ambiance and genuinely nice, caring service.  I wish all small businesses ran this way!"

kXbGVjrKFON6AfMojbWCSA,4,"I think the only reason that I am reviewing this is because it is a part of my life almost every day. I am actually privileged enough to drive this beautiful route every day to work. The road that starts from Blue Diamond RD and dumps you into Summerlin, is the most amazing stretch of road in Las Vegas. 

The ""Red Rock Loop"" is something you should take the time to see no matter if you are a local or tourist. If you are into hiking, biking, rock climbing, bouldering, photography, (...and the list goes on) this place is right up your alley. 

*If you are really into rock climbing, the post from ""noriko n. Bishop, CA"" is spot on!

The Visitor Center is great for kids. It is very educational and schools often take field trips out there.

I guess I'm partial to this area of town because it has been such a staple in my life since I moved here. Many good times and breath taking scenery. Trust me you won't believe your eyes!
Cheers"
k5O4a_uplE4A3Qamqy6jgg,4,I have been here several times and I like it a lot.  This style of retail is quite intriguing.  The place is very large and very clean.  The selection is great and prices are good.  They have pretty decent food too.  Keep the cinnamon rolls coming please.
M8Sd-S2n0myYKQo2G9XAkQ,3,Arena is nice. Concession stands are good. Problem I have is the seating in the upper level. These are the most uncomfortable seats in any arena. The seats don't seem sturdy and if the guy next to me moves so does my seat by a lot. Seem like cheap seats.
jY6EDYw8ayy8hLfceBZgRg,4,"I don't know what it is about Northern Chinese dim sum places... either I'm just really easily impressed because I have this sort of food so infrequently (maybe I'm just over the whole Cantonese-style dim sum thing?), or it's just that good. I have been here a number of times and I have always enjoyed the food here. This time, we got xiao long bao/soup dumplings, an egg/onion pancake thing, rice roll thing, spicy tofu, regular dumplings, and a bun that you dip into condensed milk. For the most part I liked everything except I could have done without the spicy tofu. The bun with condensed milk was really good, but so simple, it's like something you can just make at home yourself. Whatever they put into their dumplings was seriously addictive like crack though, like I couldn't stop eating them and just thinking about them now is making me salivate. The restaurant is also pretty nicely decorated as well, high ceilings, fairly roomy, etc. Great place to go to if you're getting tired of the typical Cantonese/HK dim sum fare and want to try something new and delicious!"

OIlftFshEzDxyfp77olj7A,1,"My parents hired Howard Air based on a friend's recommendation when they needed to replace their air-conditioner two years ago. Since then, the brand new unit they bought from Howard Air was replaced last summer after it died 4 times. Today, when my siblings and I were planning to go to my parents' house for Father's Day, my mom called and said the brand new unit they purchased less than a year ago died.  My Dad called Howard Air twice today and no one returned his call. He was finally able to get ahold of a manager and was told someone will show up around 6 pm to take a look. Based on my parents' experience and when I met the a/c technician from last year's fiasco, I think Howard Air is a clown operation. I'm so furious about this situation because my parents are in their 80s. This is the SECOND a/c unit Howard Air sold to my parents in two years, yet it's crapped out again on the first hottest day in Phoenix. Don't hire this company. Their customer service is deplorable and their technicians are poorly trained and only specialize in Band-Aid repairs."
9-W6y_aaDkH46h7BfT1T-Q,3,"Seeing this place made me feel really sad that I don't live in Toronto. I wanted to buy pretty much everything....from pate, to cheese, to cured meats and produce. I just wanted to throw my money onto its well-lit walkways and be almost assaulted with food items in return. I think the main floor is probably the main attraction here if you're planning on hitting the best first before getting enticed to fill your stomach with other things."
aMkSXtGbj2keQDTyt1CeKQ,4,"Portions are huge, and the food is amazing.  It will be hard to choose what to eat - so bring a friend to share something with!

The Croissant French Toast is out of this world, it's moist, crisp, delicate, and buttery all at once!  The problem is you'll have to choose between that and the Chicken and Waffles, which come with a Strawberry Whipped butter.  I literally ate the strawberry butter like ice cream - my heart doesn't feel good, but my taste buds said it was worth it!  

The only issue with the Chicken and Waffles is that you have to make a decision on what to dip your chicken in: the strawberry butter?  Some syrup with a little waffle?  Or do you use the house made BBQ sauce, that is smoky and spicy with a great flavor?  

Not there for breakfast or want more of a lunch or dinner option?  You have to consider the Huevos Rancheros - large chips with beans, salsa, cheese, your choice of eggs, and my favorite - FRIED JALAPENOS!  They are soooooo tasty to pick off and eat.  

Think you can handle any dish?  Then order the Holy Davoli Burger.  The patty is well sized, cooked to pink in the middle burger and then placed between a pair of grilled cheese sandwiches with some pickle slaw...it's more than a mouthful to bite!  And yes, I said a PAIR of grilled cheese sandwiches!  One with tomatoes, the other with bacon!

I have already sent a few friend over to you - who are asking what to try - and I don't have a single answer for them, just to try it all!!!"
RyuGo6frJAt4NsgMN5VU8g,3,"This is a 2 star Shoppers location but the extra star is for the parking lot, the only one downtown that had one that I have found.

Co7cO7Rjje3SYGWyEjXdHA,4,"The Cosmopolitan is trying to keep this place so hidden that it doesn't even have a name. You will only know about it from word of mouth or reading about it. I read about it in a local magazine and was anxious to give it a try. 

Even though I read where it was I still had a hard time finding it. It is on the 3rd floor near several other restaurants. Literally look for a dimly lit hallway with old record albums lining the wall. If you see a pinball machine straight ahead you've found it! 

I lived near Chicago for 11 years so it's hard for me to appreciate anything other than Chicago style pizza (deep dish an/or thin crust with sweeter sauce). That said, this pizza was pretty darn good for thin crust and fair priced at $3 a slice for cheese and an extra 50 cents for each additional topping. I tried a cheese slice and a slice of pepperoni. Both were good but I must admit that I did use a napkin to soak up some excess grease from the pepperoni slice. 

The option to just stop in for a slice of pizza is great as long as you can locate it. I heard the beer price is reasonable but I forgot to look into it. I would recommend just running into an ABC store on your way over for a huge beverage selection. 

Will definitely remember this place for a quick, easy snack or meal."

The food is delicious, and they have been able and willing to meet my dietary restrictions with delicious fare. 

And, although the place is great, I've never come dressed better than semi-nice and that is perfectly acceptable. Highly recommend."

TqBGVVMvCBbELwhP6g4PIA,3,"I've used U-Haul about a half dozen times to make a move. This time was slightly different. All I needed was a big enough vehicle to pick something up and take it home (I've reached the age where few of my friends have a truck or SUV anymore, and not enough kids to go out and get a new one, yet). 

I rented a utility van for 20 dollars plus mileage. Not a bad deal, but still came to a lot more than it was worth. Probably should have gotten a truck from Lowes, but I was moving a glass table top and didn't want to risk it falling out of the bed. 

Getting the van, then returning it was easy. I have no real complaints about the place. Not bad considering U-Haul is the biggest (and probably overall most obnoxious) truck rental service."

wrf0-r7iyNg4-Tkv3oYplQ,3,"Their door says ""temporarily closed"" but if you look inside it is completely cleared out. There is an empty cash tray on the counter, a hole in the ceiling with a chunk of the dry wall fallen to the floor and nothing else.   On the door there was an email to contact for ""more information"" but  All emails sent were alerted as failed delivery. The corporate office has yet to return a call or email sent 2 months ago so no help there.  On a positive note, I noticed that there were no automatic billings since December.

I haven't even been there for several months because I didn't think their therapy machines were helping me more than things I could do at home when I don't feel well. They made no warning of closing the doors or made an offer to refund accounts. I was concerned  when their AC was out for several weeks this summer and now this? 


As for the experience when I did go regularly I would give it about 3/5 stars. Half of the personnel were nice and half super cranky. It is a very awkward situation when everyone coming in is there on the all you want for free plan. What incentive, I worried, would ""gate keepers"" at the reception desk have to fit me in on the schedule or even check to see what therapy was available? Most of the time things worked out, albeit, and several times I got the opportunity to try the red bed, uv, LED facial, and hydration. Other than tanning, I can't say for certain anything had any result. I would rather now use my infra red lamp at home that definitely makes a difference for me on my own clean environment and if I want I can use the tan bed at my club for $5 per visit (which will save me about $500 a year compared to the dues at this PB).  If you use tanning beds more than 100 x /year then I suppose you may do better to go to this club, on the other hand, do you really want to turn yourself a raisin."

Restrooms were dirty, and needed some serious updating/repairs. Locks on the bathroom doors didn't work, garbage all over the floor, dirty smeared mirrors, and the inside of the stalls were so incredibly dirty and gross I actually gagged.

v9jtWLYwxgQiBEK-WemqXQ,1,"My husband bought a pearl white 2006 Subaru STI from here back in 2008. The brakes were completely gone within a couple days of him buying it and he had to shell out extra money to get them replaced as they are brembo brakes (not cheap!).  While the brakes were being replaced (at Subaru), it was brought to our attention that the sway bar had broken because it was upside down! Carmax refused to cover the broken sway bar under the warranty because they said the sway bar would flip if taken over a jump and that was not warrantied. What a joke. Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar. This dealership was the last straw as far as used cars for us. Now we save and buy new."

For the kids that grew up in the 1980s, you'll find so many games from your childhood here. Q-Bert, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, --- you name it! I had a great time just rummaging around looking at all the amazing stuff here.

Pros - Nice selection of vintage video games, used video games and video game accessories. Fair prices on products they buy from you. Good service and a knowledgeable staff. Great prices on used games and movies! 

Cons - Definitely focused on gamers. If you're looking for used movies then Zia has a wider selection than here. 

Nice find....

I'd definitely recommend this place for gamers!"
N5J0mE0pJ_9zloYvEVSw_g,3,"The secret's out! 

Any place with long lines and mediocre food just isn't worthy of my time...

Honestly there is nothing amazing about this pizza! It's too oily for my taste."
VrOZIN_2orTv1HEkxX_hQg,5,"Beautiful building in an up and coming area.  South point is going to be awesome when finished.  This is a go to place for having a good time, good food, with sports thrown in for good measure!  Great sports bar with above average food.  Try the wings, or the chicken salad, you can't go wrong with either one.  Outdoor patio will be opening soon.  See you there!"
iQhygJYymcnHbQyYXYH7yQ,5,"I would give this shop 100 stars! 
I live in CA and based on other's reviews I chose this shop. Boy am I glad! I ordered online and everything was so easy. I was extremely pleased they were able to deliver for the following day. 
I had the arrangement delivered to a strict gated community and they were able to follow the directions I gave them for delivery. The person receiving the flowers was my mother-in-law and she loved them! ( she's very hard to please) #Winning 
I will definitely be ordering from this shop again!"

E7l3k4rM9xt4r6pGPDZCNQ,5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!! Service was prompt and very friendly . The rolls are amazing in flavor and quality of fish. This place is definitely a hidden gem. I can't wait to come back. YUM- pick this place you won't be disappointed
5Agf0lF812g6v8zbq8EeHg,1,"This review is not for their food because I didn't get to taste it. Just walked away from the restaurant because the manager chose to answer his phone while we were still giving him our orders. And he then proceeded to take the phone order while we waited in front of him. No matter how good your food maybe, customer service should be equally important."
0nx0b396IwLq4LGFbRquFw,4,Crane ally is a great spot for food and drinks. Great outdoor seating! I've been here several times and the food is always good. A ton of drinks to choose from. The service is usually good but I have a had a couple sub par servers here. But I'll keep going back because it's one of my favorites in CU
cOpiruzznXbfpW5vWbbHIQ,4,"Both times we have been there have been very enjoyable. We knew what to expect, a nice and slightly snooty wine bar. And we were happy! They have beer, and handcrafted cocktails as well. The bar menu is limited  to charcuterie platters, but they are very very good!"
pDvl6zwSpYjkfPM8-dRarg,4,"Our first dinner here was very good from start to finish. The inside has a nice feel to it and doesn't try to be something it's not. 

Our service was very good, and our server passed the first test of keeping our drinks filled. Food came out promptly and we never had empty dishes stacking up which seems to be so common anymore. 

The meal was great. I had the Surf and Turf and my wife had the salmon. The surf and turf was a different take...scallops and pork belly. I liked it very much. People looking for steak and lobster may be disappointed but I knew what it was when ordering and was still pleased. I thought the prices we spot on with the portions and the meal choices will have us coming back. 

As a note, we had lunch here days earlier and were super pleased...probably our new lunch spot. 

If you're looking for bar food or similar garbage you should keep looking. If you want a good meal that clearly is created by a chef, this is a place to consider. My review is only 4 stars because I like to see if the experience will be repeated on our next visit."
SE1sU84hC9X-KD5g9yn4XQ,5,"Service was great, seafood is their main forte. So if you're not a seafood person don't do it. Lobster and sushi is amazing!"
oC6kmE9Izu6sir9flhbD6A,5,"Wow, what a find. We were walking around Danforth looking for good eats. This place just looked right. We went in, and were lucky to be seated quickly. 

The food was great, service was good, and the atmosphere was outstanding. For some reason I think of an old mafioso place where everyone is family and there is a genuine warmth of character (except during the assassination runs!). 

I have eaten many times at 'nice' places in the SF Bay Area, and not one place compares to Mezes. All the high-end SF places have a tonne of annoying attitude with snooty waiters. I felt comfortable and at home at Mezes. It was like the movies!

Go there. You won't be disappointed."
c0W7abN2fF2AI_IfqV3ANQ,4,"I read the reviews and the major consensus was that it was good food, but maybe dirty.  If this place was clean - it would not be the ""bar"" atmosphere that it is.  We went for our first time last week and have already been back.  The food is GREAT and the prices, well they are CHEAP.  We had a 34 ounce beer for $4.50.  We ordered 4 meals, 2 appetizers, 2 ice teas, and 2 beers for just over $50.  If you want clean and fancy - go pay for it with; I prefer good, cheap food."
4b4hsjNoKIzFtM_LfCoXFA,3,"The first time I came to this mall, I was about 8 years old and the place seemed like one of the biggest malls I had ever seen. Unfortunately, the first time I went, we got there around closing time so I didn't really get to do any exploring or anything and I just rode the carousel before having to leave. Ever since that day, I've yearned to go back so that maybe, just maybe I could relive those golden days of childhood. Sadly, the mall is just a shell of its former self and little did I know, it was a shell even back in 2004 when I first visited. The mall seems to be an insanely popular hangout for senior citizens because the food court was packed with them, which isn't really a bad thing because at least they're getting out but it makes the place eerie and somewhat depressing seeing nothing but elderly people hanging out like the teenagers once did in the mall's distant prime. Although most stores were closed, all my favorite stores were still open like Jimmy Jazz and Champs and Pac Sun and all the other shoe stores so in my book, this mall is still quite amazing just not as good for people who prefer to shop in other stores. I'd love to see the mall make a comeback and hopefully be restored to its former glory but I just don't see it happening. Nonetheless, it's still a really fun place to spend your day and at least it has air conditioning for those boiling hot days when there's nothing else to do. But honestly, I think the mall's demise was somewhat evident if you ask me: look at the place, you have to drive to the end of the earth just to get there and it's basically in the middle of nowhere surrounded by limitless waves of used car dealers. They should've built it in a more central location."
VqzoUIuQjNJbjNsuK0P1Cw,4,"Anthony did a great job on this cover up. I think we are all a little nervous to go to a new place, well dont be Anthony was awesome to work with he took my idea and made a fabulous piece of art on my calf. You won't be sorry that you visited"

The place is really busy, so be prepared to wait if you don't make an appointment."
Sr1xKNBZI3lXJr0SJjZT7Q,4,"I went here last month to celebrate my birthday and my friend's birthday. My friend had never had a massage before and was a little wary of it (oh men!). However I assured him that once he went Elmwood, he would never go back.

The massage was exactly what I needed. We were able to get our massages in the same room. My massage therapist had me making orgasmic noises, according to my friend. And I heard a couple snores escape from his side of the room. 

As soon as we were done, he asked, ""so when do you wanna come back?"" I think he's hooked."
B2NdbO00elXypAsQN7wCIw,3,"We went to Morton's for a regular weekly dinner night, heading in they offer valet but we had to wait a bit for them to open. Talking with no smartphones.. it was horrible. The interior is dark, cool, polished and has a sleek modern appearance. I prefer this kind of environment that's very dark, so if this isn't your thing you may not enjoy the atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic date night. I ordered a mojito and it tasted like a very watery mojito with barely there liquor and a few mint leaves floating around in the glass. Sent it back and ordered a sangria instead which was much better. I am fortunate enough to have access to some of the best wines, so I never really order their wines here. They offer cabinets to store your own wine. The jumbo shrimp cocktail sauce was bland to my shrimp cocktail. Lucky Wishbone where are you?!?! I longed for just a bit of horseradish..
The BLT crab cakes were fried crisply but lacked color, and appeared a little unappetizing but tasted like meaty crab. The filet mignon sandwiches and prime cheeseburgers arrived hot but the filet mignon was a little overcooked and on the tougher side than normal. I think they were having an off night I guess because the restaurant was absolutely dead inside until it started to pick up at the end. The service was very nice and was at least redeeming in that quality. The sangria surprisingly was boozy enough to make me forget all my cares temporarily and scarf down truffle fries."

C-P_CoUww4WX6hztIKhp0A,1,"Not loving this particular location. Never could understand how someone could buy an awesome franchise like Firehouse and totally leave it in the hands of kids or students, with no experienced management around during peak time. The dining area was dirty, drink dispenser ran out of ice, and service was extremely slow during the dinner hour. The Hawaiian pork and slaw looked NOTHING like the ad. I won't post a pic of it, just too disappointing. Think I would rather drive way over to Boca Park than stop here again."
knH4U72ZBb5k9s-FxM7vkw,5,"LARGE beer selection and a delicious, eclectic menu.  Staff is friendly and knows the menu as well as the tap selection.  One of my favorite spots in the valley.  Great standing daily specials.

Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, although if you're going for lunch on a weekday, chances are you won't be able to sample any of the beers :("
HJaSqEqk5GdXtGy49Y0K8A,2,"Didn't order much in the way of variety but I wasn't feeling it. The fries were good, but the cheeseburger tasted weird. Weird as in, it was a totally plain burger that was well done and boring. Milkshakes are really expensive and they're fine but not $5+ good. They're big, maybe that's why they cost so much. And it's in Coventry. I don't know, I guess I was underwhelmed by the whole experience. Staff was great though!"
PG1ctYfPfDpoIEyDN-ILaw,5,"I'm traveling from Jersey, for work. This place is AMAZING!!! The shrimp is awesome, as well as the dips and the drinks. They have latin night on Saturday nights; and the crowd is fun, but not overbearing. If you go, you MUST request Jaston (pronounced Gaston) he's very friendly and personable, and goes above and beyond to ensure you're taken care of. Highly recommend! Ps. GIVE HIM A RAISE!!!!"
t7CfIvIAqJZ16XdLUuA69Q,4,"Star nursery is a great garden store with helpful employees. They have a pretty big selection of various plants from small in hose things to larger outdoor items. 

I visited this location on their anniversary and received free tomato plant with a purchase. I was looking for two low maintenance house plants that helped purify the air. The staff was pretty helpful, the pointed me in the right direction and that was it. 

I loved the cute little red wagons each customer gets to pull all through the store. You can get a plastic floor cover as you exit the door to avoid any spills on your ride home. 

Also if you're ever curious about what low maintenance house plants to get, I recommend aloe Vera plants, snake plants, a spider plants and golden Pothos."
a7WkSYfJdW8zP1C3Dqk8hA,5,"I go to this place regularly. Even witnessed it take the turn to fame before it was anything at all.  Any who,  if the store owners truly do read this, please know that chicken Tikka massala is supposed to be made by using chicken breasts! Not thighs or whatever part of the chicken you put in there. Every time I make that order I get  many uncooked chicken pieces in my meal and it's an appetite killer I tell ya. Please make the effort to satisfy this long time customer by handing me well-cooked chicken, chicken cooked all the way through... That type of chicken,  like chicken breasts, would go fantastic with the brilliant masalla sauce."
ZcY3WOYOQwaiA2m10vM44Q,5,"New place in Tilovi and stopped but for a glass of wine during their soft opening.  This wine bar will be my new go to place for happy hour.  They have a great staff and excited to see what happens with the space!   I love their concept of a wine bar and flower shop combined. 

This is a must see place for anyone that loves flowers and wine."
vBs-6OjW-APPh26hrd5mIg,2,"I haven't been here in about a year but I recall the atmosphere, food, and service being above average.
 I used to rave that this was my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. 
NOT ANYMORE.

Perhaps my tastes have changed, maybe I have higher expectations for service...or this place has both bland and  poorly executed food, with bad/slow service to boot.

To start, I arrived with my significant other (who is a chef) at around 7 last night. There wasn't a hostess to greet us at the door. After waiting about 3-5 minutes someone came over to greet us while carrying a load of dirty dishes, walked passed us with them and set them down on the table behind us. Mind you I understand she was helping out, but there were less than 7 tables in the place and she could have set the dishes down first away from the host stand. But she sounded friendly enough, and took us to a table inside, in a room with only one large party placed in the middle (all other tables were empty). And sat us directly next to the party, next to the loudest section of that party, where we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone hear each other. I asked to move, and the hostess moved us only one table away but still DIRECTLY next to this loud party. I then asked to be moved further and she chose one more table away from that but STILL directly next to the party. Then I complained for the third time and the guy watering our table let us finally move across the room despite ALL of the empty tables in the place. 

So I try to start again fresh focusing on the menu. My guest orders bruschetta to start for the both of us. It arrives rather quickly. The bread is about the same as what was already on the table except instead it has a thin slice of Smoked tomato and a few pieces of ricotta cheese and is really hard being overly toasted. The taste was bland because there literally wasn't anything to the bruschetta besides a slice of tomato and ricotta cheese...NO Olive Oil (which it desperately needed because it was dry), and NO salt/cracked pepper (considering it was BLAND). the only saving grace was the slice of tomato and still we would have been better off with the free bread on the table because at least that came with butter so it wasn't completely dry and a value.

Next we received our entrees. My boyfriend ordered the Eggplant Parmesan, which was pretty decent. I ordered the Braised Short Rib Gnocci dish which I have had at least 3 times.  But this time it was bland. It was supposed to have a Gorgonzola sauce. I could barely taste the cheese, there may have been a tiny hint of it according to my boyfriend (who didn't like it) and it needed salt. However, the short rib was cooked perfectly and there were plenty of the tasty mushrooms but I wished I had something with more flavor.

As for the service, it was slow and awkward. To start I had to request 3 times to be moved. Between the ""appetizer"" and Main Course my server took my B&B plate out of my hand while I was moving it closer to me and said ""thank you"" like I was handing it to her. She obviously misunderstood me, leaving me confused and stuck holding my silverware in my hands as I had nothing to set it on until I reached over and grabbed another small plate off the table next to us.  It was incredibly uncomfortable. The server also disappeared for a long time after we were finished with our meal. My boyfriend wanted to order dessert but decided against it due to the slow service, and chose to have dessert at Sweet Moses instead.

So at the end, all I enjoyed was the Blackberry and Mint cocktail, the decor and music. And my Boyfriend, the chef, said the only thing he enjoyed about dinner was dessert at Sweet Moses. They gave us excellent service, the coffee and sundaes we ordered were perfectly delicious, coffee was fresh, we liked it so much we even ordered a slice of apple pie and tipped out the staff enough that they weren't sure if it was a mistake or not.

All in all, if you are looking to have an exceptional meal while out on the town, I would pass on Luxe. But if you want Cocktails and atmosphere and maybe to share a few dishes (so you're not committed to just one in case it's bland) this could be the place for you."
YlJJz7h3KVJcBpR6vp51zg,5,Very unique! Ask for the root drink. It is a strong gin based drink that is really flavorful for the type of person that can enjoy hard sprits straight. The food was really good we will be back. The flavors and effort brought to the food were spot on. If you want to try something new and delicious stop here.
hsx490Q1JmlT9fuf_MKW-A,4,"Morimoto is fantastic. I would suggest coming here with a small group so you can try different appetizers. The tuna pizza is a must try. The sushi was well made and beautiful presented. The whole fried fish was well worth it's price. The whole fish entree was $39. The service was excellent. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was nicely decorated and laid out. The most expensive items were the steaks. It will run you about $90. Morimoto is definitely a pricey restaurant. It will cost about $100/person if you don't get steaks. Of course, in a high end restaurant like this one, the alcohol will cost you. We got a bottle of sake, 600ml, and it was $88. Oh yeah, the flaming chocolate ball. It cost $20, but when you see other tables ordering it, you would want one too. I would recommend Morimoto, especially if you are willing to splurge a bit."
xkeIX3JvdfvSXbWQso8oPw,5,"I just moved to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  Found Hypnotic on Yelp, and thought I'd give it a try.  Called Wed night to schedule a cut and they got me in first thing Thursday morning.  They set me up with BRENDA.  She talked me in to (much needed) highlights, and I'm so happy I did!  The color is great.  She asked me questions and we looked at pictures to get an idea of the cut.  I felt like she actually listened to me.  The cut is good - I'm trying to grow out my hair - and the color is great.  Thanks so much Brenda!!  I need to see you again in 6-8 weeks!!"
XZl2JIKYd78cq3pwHlr7Fw,5,"I'm 61 and this is the second Triumph I have purchased in two years. It is easy to make a comparison. I bought a Street Triple R from a dealer last year, which was unremarkable. I bought a Triumph Tiger this year from Freedom Cycle and the experience was as positive as  any big ticket purchase can be. It is always stressful negotiating for motorcycles and automobiles. I found this transaction to be quite pleasant. I was allowed to test drive whatever I wanted. I was treated courteously. There were no hidden agendas. They were very truthful and even extended a veteran discount the day after the sale because of some confusion about me being a veteran. I definitely endorse this shop and will continue to deal with them"
VEGwIJeFMHCOwIf8Pl4brg,5,"Great Cebuano food! Excellent service! Staff is very friendly. We had the Ngoyong, fried bangus, lechon and the fried rice adobo. Loved all of them. And my favorite was the dessert. I loved the Übe Cheesecake! Will definitely be coming back to this place."

GnhfZ0fCLG78CxZ4EHbHyg,4,"I've spent a fair number of hours in Lasik MD waiting rooms this week (my partner had some complications with his laser eye surgery) so I feel well positioned to say that this one is The Best! 

Pros:

* very spacious
* many large, comfy leather couches (so many, in fact, that there was at least one couch available for each person waiting for surgery - no sharing with strangers!)
* low table in front of each couch
* wifi available and signs explaining how to access said wifi
* pretty, calming animal and nature shows playing on the flat screens rather than annoying CP24 - and no tv sound!
* solid music choices - not musak, not elevator jazz, a good background combo of quiet pop, folk, and classics
* free coffee, fruit, and cookie/muffin snacks 

Cons: 

* located in Mississauga (which, from my downtown, bike-riding perspective, might as well be on the moon)
* the whole room is brightly lit, with no dim area for those recovering from surgery

This was an ideal place to set up my lap top and do some essay writing whilst waiting. Couldn't ask for more than that."
oB7uELP_uGyzz9aT2iYemQ,4,"What a delicious mexican restaurant! It's certainly worth the drive to the NE side of town. It's a small mom & pop type place. We recommend the Carne Ranchera platter. Hopefully the waiter, Christian, will be there when you go! You won't be disappointed."
6vcSnXplwn_A6ALRlfXkwQ,1,"DONT EAT HERE!!  Management is rude and don't care about people or service.

SlNhf2j9B-Ert71QzLCpVw,5,Fun atmosphere. Good service. Food was very reasonably priced. Nice selection of specials. Food was delicious! Great local craft beer selection! Will definitely be back!
UlIhxiIf1QMhbAtxYoyPUQ,3,"Wow! I'm pretty surprised by all the 5 star reviews. I mean, this place is next to Burger Bar! I have to say that the only reason this place got 3 stars was for the excellent service we got from Amber at the bar. She was on top of the drinks, snappy banter and baseball so I was very happy!

WHEN YOU GO- I was not impressed by even their chips and salsa. The chips in our nachos were 10X better so I feel like the table chips sit around for awhile. We also had the mixed enchiladas and steak fajitas and both were pretty dang flavorless. Drinks and nachos are the only thing I'd order here again. Liquor prices were not bad at all - $6 beers and $8 premium liquor shots."
gAG2dZ5fpi_IjkIQkHXdNQ,5,"Piccolo forno is, hands down, the best value for food in the city that I have come across. I've been half a dozen or more times since I moved to Pitt and Piccolo Forno has never disappointed me. If you've never been before, at least one person at your party should order the marscapone y speck pizza to share with the group. It is simply delightful.

Portions are extremely reasonable- I'm a normal sized, younger man and I'll eat 6/8 slices at dinner and not leave hungry. Prices feel extremely low (13-15) for a pizza of such insanely high quality. BYOB makes this place the highest value restaurant I can think of. 

The only downside of the restaurant is that they do not take reservations. They will, however, call you so what I've always done- either in a group of 2, 3, 4, or 6, is to place the reservation and head across the street to round corner cantina to enjoy a drink while we wait. I recommend you do the same as the wait will often be 30-50 minutes if you arrive during prime time."
Xv8fVD_Mb-t3vzNnFBNwXQ,3,Wish I'd read some previous reviews before I went here. If there isn't an event in the area go someplace else. Food was OK. If you want dinner in an empty warehouse this is the place to go. Service was OK but not great.
-HokYvNeLOSr9h5xBNvLkg,5,"This place is AWESOME! My wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas recently, while we were in town for our wedding/honeymoon week (4/22-4/26/12). We should have gone here instead of going to Alize upstairs on the night of our wedding. The vibe at N9NE is young, hip and chic (but no one is out of place). If you don't mind paying a lot of money for really good food, then this is the place for you. I had the wedge salad, the 16 oz. bone-in filet with a king crab leg, and a wonderful wheat beer. Although you are going to pay an arm and a leg for the food (we paid $350), I believe it was WELL worth it.

I disagree with Jordan A. - you would expect a place like this to be pretentious - but the staff that we encountered (hostess, waiter, bus boys) were all very nice, and very attentive. Although we don't have a lot of money, we never felt out of place or that anyone was looking down at us. We were treated very well."
nokc9hLKST6CdetkkTc2wA,3,"Today was my first time trying The Little Greek and the experience was a less than thrilling. I'm giving 3 stars (generously) because the food did taste good for the most part but service and handling of issues was a big turn off. 
My roomate and I placed separate orders through the Yelp app. I ordered the small Greek salad and gyro combo and chose the ""pay with cash"" option. He placed his order and chose to pay with card, so the transaction had already gone through by the time we arrived. The app said that the wait time would be 10-35 minutes, so I called the restaurant before to get a better estimate/make sure they had received the orders. I called 3 TIMES with no answer, so we decided to head that way to be safe. 
When we arrived, there was a paper sign on the door that read ""closed for democratic event"", but walked up anyway because we had already paid for a portion of our order. After some struggle, it was found that only one order was received (mine) and the card transaction was ""not received"" but payment had already been taken out...strange. The ""owner"" (when I asked if she owned the place, her response was ""it depends on the day of the week"") quickly prepared the other order and sent us on our way without an apology or any encouraging reason to come back and visit. I understand that the restaurant was preparing for an event, but also feel that customer service ALWAYS comes first and that the staff could have handled things better. 
In the end, I did enjoy my gyro, despite the fact that it was fullllll of tomatoes, which I requested to be left out. Same thing with the Greek salad. Full of tomatoes and wayyyyy too much of the Greek dressing. I may come by again, but will explore other options first."
5iq8BECxykZneta1RT9ViA,3,"I'd been wanting to see this show for quite awhile and finally went. Tickets are pretty expensive, so we sat far back. Still fun, but could be a little hard to see. 

The line to get in was really long. Don't make the mistake we did and go to the upstairs theater. Once we found the right place, we sat on a bench and waited for the line to die down. The show actually started around 930. 

High energy fun show!"
IZ2RIKgwXMEmlhNI2-KU7Q,3,"The manager and Kathy corrected my very lop sided upper lip. They went above and beyond to make me happy. I'm so mad at myself for not being able to go back for my last syringe due to being hospitalized. I will say I felt like I was was being treated a little like how dare I reach out to someone in management to try and correct this situation... lip filler is super expensive and I just wanted something I love for the money I'm spending not walking around trying to hide the part of me I paid money to look better. I get a different vibe now anytime I go like I am more of a pain, and no longer even receive check up notifications but I appreciate them correcting the situation at hand. They have done great work don't let my experience deter you."
-IhxGMhGDz1o85CTrM5s6w,5,"I am now a regular at daily dose both for breakfast & lunch. Perfect for all types of occasions & appetites. All of the food is made in house, they have a nice variety on the healthy side, truly savory options for the not so healthy side ;) I highly recommend the banana bread French toast, it's incredible & not too sweet at all! I love the unique DD hash as a side dish; butternut squash, onion, potato and light seasoning = heavenly. Also recommend the Eggs Benedict & NEW BBQ sandwich melt, even their side salads are a generous portion & very fresh! I've met friends for brunch (mimosas & bloody Mary's are great) & even brought my dog on the side patio for a quick bite. You have to check this place out!"
IBOWhfCuy0ibbfaBzPE68w,5,This is literally the best salon I have found in Arizona. By now I have probably tried a dozen different places and some were okay and some were horrible. I tried out Salon VIP last Saturday and let me tell you....this is by far the only place that knows what they are doing when it comes to hair. I have not been this satisfied since I got my hair done professionally in Europe. Try them out you won't be disappointed. Not to mention the price is right!
48YesHROhf6HX9fJWQFXTQ,1,"This is for the location at Scottsdale and shea. Absolutely horrible service. My wife went in there to place an order. She had in her hand, written down, what fish and sides she wanted. The guy behind the counter was very rude and condescending.  She doesn't know a lot about poke. So instead of working with her, all he did was yell and acted as if she was an inconvenience.  She will never enter that establishment again. Very poor customer service for this location."
fUK_qoNmIuAyh2ltymoCIg,1,We got horrible service before we even got sat. It was late and we worked all night. We just wanted some food and a place to talk. It is right across the street from our house so we thought it was perfect especially seeing it was three in the morning.  The server was annoyed that we were even standing there. We refused to sit and continue getting horrible service so we went to Dennys instead.
q4BBwbNB-YmYVoSsBamnDQ,4,"Pretty good ramen in the east end! The noodles and the broth are great here. Don't overlook the donburi bowls either- they had more flavour than I was expecting. 

One star off for the small portion of ramen. If you're hungry, definitely get extra noodles!"
J3XJdBbLNQFH6rHEYFmOxg,4,"My husband and I have been eating at Los Olivos for the last 15 years.  This restaurant is authentic Mexican cuisine.  The place is run by family.  
Sometimes you do have to wait awhile for the food.  The wait staff is usually pretty good.  
The food is always fresh and served hot.  Today I ordered the Chimichanga plate.  The shredded beef is always delicious.  There homemade salsa is so delicious.  

I'm not sure exactly what restaurant a previous reviewer ate at stating they ate garbage.  Maybe they were at Taco Bell.  

You won't be disappointed with Los Olivio's but be patient.  Authentic food that's fresh takes time so enjoy visiting with friends and family while you wait."
c74JNKQpeLRy6DutZKiu2w,5,"I love the food at Rachel's kitchen. Every time I visit Vegas, I need to stop here at least once. Today we ordered the veggie burger, chopped salad, smoothie, and eggs. Everything tasted great, the service was terrific and the staff is really nice and considerate. 
No trip to Vegas is complete without a stop at Rachel's kitchen"
G5fZgwGSw9My0zyQ5LNmrQ,5,"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING! My brother recommended it to me when I asked where my friend and I should go for a glass of wine and dinner, and it was honestly the best place he could have recommended. The atmosphere was great, the staff was super friendly (even when I had to be a pain and ask for a different table), and I loved that there was multiple seating areas- inside, outside, and at the bar. It was a Tuesday evening and they were really busy, but that wasn't really a turnoff. Our waitress recommended wine for us, which was great. After seeing A LOT of people around us with the gnocchi and meatballs we figured it must be good and decided to order and split it- great choice, it was delicious and it was a decent sized serving and I was full after splitting it in half."
4XeOuvBOkOkti2R5wmnyyg,2,Part of my order was missing. There were hard inedible bits in Some of the dishes. Everything was WAY too Sweet. Large lumps of chicken fat. No balance to the flavours at all. Greatly overpriced considering the quality. This is like the Mcdonalds of Thai food. Dont bother and never trust the Just-eat rating.

Vq2H9YobFX5T1-YPhEu-fQ,4,"This was my first visit to this location, but as many have mentioned once you have been to one Chipotle you've been to them all.  I went  to this location since 50% of sales went to a school fund raiser for my son.  98.7% of the time I get the Burrito Bowl and this visit was no different.  It was amazing like normal.  I also tried their Queso for the very first time and it was very good as well.  It was very busy since there was a fund raiser going on, but our wait in line was less than ten minutes from the time we parked until we were eating huge burrito bowls."

veK9eK5tBZOmWsDR-WeI_g,5,"80th and Ivy is a new restaurant in town, and they know what they are doing. I checked out the place this weekend and had a very, very positive experience.

From the moment I walked in, Jamie, the bar manager introduced himself to me and was really friendly. The restaurant was empty, but the patio was full. It was windy outside, so we sat inside. The decor is fresh, simple and modern. Very cool place to get together with some friends or an informal date. The menu is interesting and varied. Our table of 4 ordered a bunch of different things to share: the arugula salad, the rotisserie chicken sliders, margherita flatbread, tuna and watermelon salad and herbed frites. All the dishes were good, and well-presented. By the end of the meal, we were all satisfied, and not overly-stuffed. 

We also ordered some cosmos and some glasses of Moscato D'Asti. The drinks were very, very good. The cosmos were different from ones I've had at other places. More fresh, fruity and refreshing. And the Moscato was AMAZING. Absolutely PERFECT summer wine. 

The main standout of 80th and Ivy, however, was the service. Our waitress Chelsea was friendly, warm and gave the right amount of space. She seemed genuinely interested in providing us with nice, attentive service. Jamie kept to check up on us again while we were eating. My friends thought I must have known Jamie from before, seeing as to how attentive him and his staff were to us. But no, this was my first time there, and we truly felt like valued patrons. This is a rare occurrence in this city. Well, in any city for that matter.

I would return to 80th and Ivy in a heartbeat. Fabulous atmosphere, excellent service and great drinks - 80th and Ivy is off to a superb start!"
BKDNIQSei53eSvKWuejzLg,5,"Daily Kitchen is a great place to get a fresh meal that isn't overly sauced or swimming in grease. The presentation is nice, and the portions are just right. 

I just ate the chicken, egg, and avocado wrap and loved it. I also had the quinoa hash browns which were well done just the way I like them. 

The environment is clean and comfortable. It's definitely worth a try."
OTwcKc7zREnXTqxN_u7YLA,5,"I'm a regular here. 
And there's a good reason for that. 
I'm a fan of Thai food, and even though I'm not Thai, i know all about this authentic cuisine. 
This is by far the best Thai food in Vegas, and might be the best I've had in the nation. 
Be ready for at least 45 min wait if you didn't make reservation, but trust me it's worth it. 
Go for the Pad see ew. 
Go for the curries. 
Go for the whole fish.
And definitely go for the crispy duck Panang. 

Trust me. I know food."
FIspqZ7_cRDiWNdteOGDDw,5,"We had our wedding here in 2009 with Elvis and it was fantastic!  Our Elvis was so much fun and oh he could sing!  This is the best way to do a wedding.  You just call them up tell the date and time and they ask you which package you want, what colored roses, and where should the limo pick you up.  Also, they live-stream the wedding over the internet so all your family and friends can watch it without being there!  We want to renew our vows just so we can come back!  Such a great experience, an Elvis wedding!"
g-CYrpvJ2j0xfQ5K700EUw,5,"They have the best Italian food in Vegas. The service either for lunch or dinner is fantastic.

The décor is outdated but the food is modern and delicious."
Jw2mrp9APO0H_xnfq3NffQ,5,"We are new in town and haven't had the opportunity to interview Pediatrician's in the area. My youngest son fell ill with a bad cough/congestion so I took him to Southwest Medical Urgent Care, which also just happens to be 1.1 miles from where we currently live. From check in to check out the front desk staff Catherine was pleasant and professional, Dr. Litman attended to my son, he was very attentive about my concerns and addressed them immediately to his staff. After a chest X-ray, my baby had pneumonia. They administered Albuterol mist and ibuprofen for his fever. A few days later Dr. Litman personally called me to see how my baby was doing and suggested I take him in for a follow up/check up the next week. That means the world to me that he took time out in his busy schedule to call. Less than two weeks later, I received a letter in the mail from Dr. Litman thanking me for selecting them for my urgent care needs. I am now in the process of looking into a Pediatrician from their medical group in the same building. Keep up the great work!"
4F-ZIqh_Inp3-oapNouVyw,4,"Great atmosphere.  We came on a Saturday night, there's a live band playing easy listening music. 

Their famous dish here is the Crazy Alfredo. Which is a fettuccine in Alfredo sauce with other red sauce ingredient to arrive at the perfect combination of the two sauces.  Nothing fancy about this place, but the food was good.  Check it out if you're looking to get off the strip and pay non-strip price quality food."
Ll-e_9VlHSpWoJo0-6qD_g,5,"I have been coming here since I was little with my parents. When you pull up its kinda crazy but don't be scared it's a house. 
The service is always quick and everyone makes sure your drinks are filled. I haven't been here in a coupe years so it was nice when my mother decided to invite me for lunch it was a walk down memory lane sorta speak. 

It was a Sunday and lunch time so I decided to order the red menudo. They have the option of small or large bowl , I went with the small bowl and it was a perfect lunch combo that came with a choice of corn or flour tortilla. 
The menudo was nice and hot and had a great amount of perfect flavors.
The restaurant is family owned so you know your service will be excellent when they are all striving for the same goal under one roof."
-DSyIy75VEP4yJI_Fogf6w,5,"Beaudevin has the best atmosphere in the Charlotte airport and is always my favorite place to stop.

There's lots of healthy menu choices and the food has always arrived quickly. Hey, if you want to indulge there's always Cinnabon next door!"
86aBchQ7sXpQg4VA-eQB7Q,4,"I've had the chance to have dinner at To-ne sushi. The restaurant has a very spacious atmosphere and the menu covers pretty much most of the standard Japanese food. There isn't any particular special item and therefore I selected the most traditional dish for dinner - Beef Donburi.

Beef Donburi was good and the portion was appropriate. The restaurant served two bowls of soup - one is a miso soup, and the other I believe is extra (probably extra soup base for udon). 

However, to my surprise, is the birthday celebration. On the same night, the waiter brought out a cake to celebrate a customer's birthday. The restaurant turned off the lights and played loud music of ""Happy Birthday"". It was a good laugh and the rest of the customers went along with it."
uFgdxi-w5z08n9KrudshGw,4,"Goodne... Graici... Mmmmme! These burgers are absolutely scrumptious! My colleague picked up the burger for me so I can't quite review the pIace. But from what I hear, their business concept is interesting, and their website forwards to a church website every Sunday. 

Now, what I can review is the food; I decided to be not-so-adventurous and opted for the cheeseburger. Here's a breakdown:

Burger Buns: comparable to McDonalds in size, smaller than the Burger King Whopper.

Inside: pick and choose ... I don't go fancy so I had ketchup, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Some other choices? Mustard, onions, pickles, pepper, etc.

Patty: nice and crumbly homemade patty, good flavours. Nice consistency! 

Cheese: the good stuff. Doesn't taste cheap, doesn't taste like cardboard.

Filling? My colleagues usually order 2-3 burgers each... I usually get just 1 because I like it light. It's definitely a lot lighter than your usual burgers.

Sides: fries? I hear the fries aren't that great. But haven't had them, so no comment. 

Price: a burger is about $5.99; that's inexpensive for a nice gourmet burger. 

That's it, folks! Best burger ever."
Q-EKnFhDbV6Fc0gQ8xas3A,4,"Came here for a business lunch and absolutely loved their lunch menu! Which doesn't happen to be available in Vegas, so that's a win for Scottsdale!

We were quickly seated and promptly greeted. Our server was sweet and the food came out fast. 5 stars for all that. But the restaurant felt sort of like a diner with sort of dingy booths and I was disappointed in the food a bit.

I ordered the Salmon lunch box for $10.95. It came with a salad with I didn't care for, Miso soup which was good, and the entree had a glazed piece of salmon that was tasty but small, edamame which was cold, a couple of pieces of a California roll which were meh.. but good enough to eat. It also had a side of rice but I didn't try it. The prices were decent for lunch, and I'd be willing to give it another go to try something else off the menu, but it didn't bowl me over."
tHBaAotjnImr1F0uf-dVrA,5,Wow what a cute little place! The family that runs this business is super sweet. It's very special to see an entire family working together.  We went here for the first time for breakfast this morning and were very pleased. I had the eggs Benedict and it was cooked perfectly. The hash browns are tasty too. (Like little matchstick fries) We also shared a chocolate croissant and it was delicious! We will definitely be back soon!
4MC7WJEbKGh3klgxu7KFlg,2,"Three things; grit in the bottom of the paper cups displayed on the table used as dispensers for wet naps and extra napkins; sticky doorknobs  on the bathroom doors no doubt from folks going after handling saucy and sticky things; French frys being portioned out with bare hands by the cook.
I guess after you've been open for a couple of years you lose track of the details. Hmmmmm? 
Wings are served with tips attached which cuts down on food costs for the restaurant but gives you more stuff to leave on the plate that you paid for after eating. The fabulous Mac and cheese was Sahara dry.
Oh yeah, one more thing. I forgot to mention the flies.
You've been warned!"

lkrTTvkGzqDHSSPuXZ5PbQ,5,Hit up this spot on Sunday. The whole pool area is pretty badass nice remodel job. Lots of peeps early on but some left probably for other day clubs. We got a daybed at a nice spot so it was chill. The staff was awesome and took care of our party of four like we were VIPs lol. So we appreciate that! We pretty much had buckets of beers all day at a reasonable rate. Had some jack and coke later on and absolutely had a good pour!  The servers working all look good especially in them blue two piece. Overall we dropped $250 with $50 tip so it was worth it. A lot less expensive then other day clubs. Security Mike was chill he took good care of all of our stuff while we chilled in the pool. Gave him a tip as well he earned it. We will definitely hit this spot again next time we're in Vegas!
iaS-BHpsJUSKKrK0Us4h0Q,5,"Great market for local and organic produce.

Lots of good food vendors as well.
If you go there - don't forget to check out the back ponds - it's nature in the city."
V8Z5e3tZ5GrT7IldBPQ5Xw,1,Do they ever have fully working pumps? At all times they have at least 2-3 pumps that are out of service when I come here. This makes maneuvering around trying to wait for a free pump a total pain in the ass especially when your dealing with other customers that are so oblivious to their surroundings. This is the last time I'll ever give this location a chance. A total waste of time and not worth the headache.
nrKuvSgjaNHxC8BGDoX1IA,5,Gordos is great food for the price. The staff is very friendly and accomudating. They're breakfast burritos are as good as anyone in the area. For me it all starts with the tortilla and they have quality tortillas. I also like that they have a salsa bar.
YeSL7VXTEqmiUnPw1m7ruA,1,So after reading the reviews I decided this place must be the best place in town.... So we ordered two pizzas and two pops the guy came to the door was rude expecting a big tip maybe? I don't know but he never brought us are pop but we still payed for them and then we go to eat the pizza and it's not even cut we had to spend 15 min trying to cut these two large disks ... If this is the best pizza in Montreal I'll wait to go back to Alberta... I wouldn't even give this place a one star it's a never return...
6K0aB8jJ5R-Ran7ewsqoCw,4,"Who doesn't love warm light donuts with your favorite toppings!! Me I DO!!

Made to order .. served warm.. order one of the favorites or customize your donut to your liking!! These are light cake donuts .. 

In the window they advertise the flavor of the month.. today was strawberry glaze, graham cracker & marshmallow drizzle.. messy goodness!!

I also had the chocolate glaze with crushed peanuts & peanut butter drizzle .. delish!! $1.75/ea 

You can also customize a coffee drink to wash it all down! 

This is a 5-star place but I hate ordering from an unmanned checkout point .. no one to walk you through the process or offer any suggestions for a first time customer. Trying to figure out where to slide my debit card was a bit confusing but I got it figured out. 

 I will definitely be back for a sweet treat & coffee!"

i had the italian and it was great, fresh deli meats soft bread and friendly service to boot?

i managed to try some of my friends' bobbies and capastrami and those blew me out of the water as well.

oh and pricing is fair enough and what you would come to expect.
they could be charging more.

She ordered in the setting for us to see and feel before purchasing.  She also had hand picked a few diamonds for the center stone and let him choose.  The setting itself is unique and detailed.  I couldn't be happier!

I love that we decided to go with a local jeweler.  It was a fun experience and well worth the time spent looking.  We were never pressured into anything we didn't like or that was out of our price range which was such a relief!  

You will definitely be seeing us back in the store when it's time to purchase our wedding bands!"

A family owned business, they're extremely friendly & a very comfortable environment!
They carry books, bibles, music, gifts & so much more! 
LOVE this coffee shop & bookstore!"
EtzIL4UhQtMU_WW1uGPO9Q,2,I don't know who these people giving high stars are but they have no taste buds because this food is flavorless... Which is very hard to do with Chinese food. Everything tastes LITERALLY watered down. Look at the sweet and sour sauce it's clearly cut with water.   I expect them to be out of business soon

iCca4AbkduxM3iEcIzWF4w,5,"Nice quiet spot to relax with a glass of wine and friends. Great wine by the glass selection--not just your standard cab, merlot, point. Very attentive service and the bruschetta was fresh. Had one weak/older glass of Rhone, but they opened a fresh bottle without hesitation.

The upside: Happy Hour . . $5 on select wines; and the wines were good choices--a French white blend, a Cali rose, etc.

The only downside: the corking fee...seems stupid, but that could be a state law.

Overall, I would recommend (and if I lived in Ohio, I'd be going back often!).

We do so enjoy the Five Guys and this one does not disappoint. 
 
The burgers are always made to order which means it takes a little longer than fast food joints, but it is worth the wait.  A couple can easily share even a small fry as they give you quite a bit with your order.  The Cajun fries add just a little bit of seasoning but not enough spice too be too hot.

If you are looking for a nice burger without being fast food this is a good place."
e91IO2opmkNF_X_FFf-mEw,2,"They are really popular because they just opened.

I ordered from the Drive Thru. It took 30 minutes to get my order. Ordered the American Omelette which was just sitting in a pool of grease. Disgusting, couldnt even eat it. Their crossaint sausage, egg and cheese sandwich wasnt bad. But again, it was very greasy. The hot chocolate isnt homemade. It tastes like powder. Ive ordered a sandwich and salad from here before. Wasnt thrilled with it either. And their lemonade was so tart, it was inedible. Dont think Ill be coming here again or recommending it to the co-workers. Terribly disappointed."
y3F-6nJJEunYwEIHGMge3g,1,"Horrible. Worst I have been treated since I have been in Phoenix (five years). There are signs on the pumps that state, ""To prevent fraud, all credit card transactions must be done inside."" I thought it odd, but walked inside. The guy who worked there said hi. I said, ""Hi. I'm wondering, why do you have to come inside to pay?"" He said, harshly, ""Did you read the signs?"" I said, ""Yes,"" He said, ""Then you just answered your question, didn't you, buddy? Not too tough, was it?"" I looked at him, incredulous. Seemed like a harmless question. I turned to walk out, saying, ""I think I'll get gas somewhere else."" He said, ""You do that, buddy. No skin off my back.""

Based on the fact that there was nobody else there, I think it probably was. Maybe not the douchebag I talked to, but the owner probably wouldn't appreciate the fact that his employees are treating customers like that.

Well, I guess I'm not a customer.

Never will be, either."
I6mZqV94BOuEbgEiiWt3-Q,1,"This was probably one of THE most disappointing experiences in Vegas. We were booked for a non-smoking King room, didn't get it. 3 Hotel rooms for a 2 night stay is extremely inconvenient, and the way this was handled was at best disappointing and unfortunately will not be back to this hotel. So let's start the story by saying this was our first time away from our 15mo old daughter. Upon check in we were offered an upgrade to a mini suite for an additional $15 a night....who wouldn't jump on that for a romantic weekend getaway?! Walking into the room the smoke hit you like a brick wall! The windows open to air out, it was almost as if the person was still in there chain smoking. Our friends walked in and her eyes started burning and watering. Immediately my husband calls the front desk to change rooms (15mins from initial check in), they informed him that they didn't have another mini suite to move us to, so he said I'll take our old room without the upgrade, that's fine. They then tell him that they don't have that either and that they only have a 2 Queen non smoking....we take that. So basically it seemed as though they over sold, never had our king non smoking and were trying to make money off of their mistake. They said they would call us tomorrow to switch our room to what we had booked. We waited until 6pm with no phone call and had to speak to them when we arrived back at our hotel."
zCC1aPKOnWnjvg7Jng4XhA,4,"Thanks yet again to the Yelp app for finding my lunch.  I typed in ""soul food,"" and this place appeared.  It had half a dozen glowing reviews, so we decided to give it a shot.  Very glad we did.  Angie is very friendly, I stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu.  She advised me to call and order what we wanted, as the food is cooked to order, and it is not quick.  This is totally fine with me, I find that generally, the quicker stuff is, the less ""real"" it is.  And usually, the better it tastes when it takes some time to cook.

There are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  

I had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entrée, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.

The employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.  This is some serious soul food, highly recommended."
PYh1SRQpAblrmMbEXWFgzg,4,"I cannot rave about this place enough. I stumbled upon it by accident after playing poker at the bellagio when I was heading back to valet. Sat myself at the bar and began nibbling on the tapenade and breads which was excellent. I recommend the olives  burger with the truffle fries. Both were outstanding and cooked just right. For
Dessert (and I only have dessert if I've enjoyed the entree) I had the chocolate peanut which was very good. I would certainly return to olives because the service above all was outstanding."
YLGD2ShRSC9MewEE74Xv9g,5,Fantastic service at honest prices.  They fixed my rusted exhaust for a fraction of what Pep Boys wanted to charge.

kaiswfDc2op5qOCI2o-OrA,5,"My hair was a wreck.  I looked like a tortoiseshell calico cat, with three different colors of hair.  My hair was dry, split, and broken.  It was attracting hummiingbirds, who thought they might nest in it.   I did a bit of web research, and felt Christophe might have the kind of expert coloring and conditioning I was searching for.  

The salon is beautiful, a bit hidden in the back of the huge MGM hotel complex, and it overlooks the elaborate pool area.  The stations are sleek and clean, modernistically streamlined.  Sunlight flooded the stations, and made for a pleasant ambience.

I made an appointment with Jean-Marc at Christophe, and had a brief consultation when I arrived.  My colorist Paul, also consulted in great detail, to be sure of the effect I wanted.  I had gathered several pictures, since color is extremely hard to describe save visually, and also had a style discussion.  I wanted a bit of a trendy retro look, a slight bouffant, and believable honey blond streaks.  Paul proceeded to do the most precise job of streaking my hair that I have ever have.  I have long, normally strong straight hair, and he patiently streaked my entire mane.  He also touched up the brass at the roots, and did a marvelous conditioner, that made my hitherto straw locks look like silk.  The L'Oreal hair products I got to continue the condition have helped my hair heal.

Then I had the pleasure of Jean Marc creating a personal style appropriate to my yen for glamour, and busy lifestyle.  He quickly and masterfully rendered a long Bardot-inspired cut, which took advantage of my slight natural wave, and created a casual, yet suave look.  At $150.00 for the cut, it is a bargain.

When I left the salon, I was walking on air, my newly blown-dry mane signaling the resurection of a devoted fashionista.

Merci mille fois to both Paul and Jean-Marc!"

h7Qhlk9wPNI9ysH2cJJflw,1,"Wanted to try something that we don't have back home....the front door said it all ""This is a bad place for a diet"" Great food and even better service."
ABYFSO34-gAo3yoPk041YA,1,"Waited anxiously for this place to open. Have been 4 times in the last 3 weeks. Every time something is majorly wrong. I keep hoping they'll improve but I may have to stop coming. The seating area is way too small. There's always a line to get in. (Good for them I guess.) They don't offer everything on their menu. (Then remove the items. The menu is a laminated piece of printer paper.) The service is not in the order you arrived. You'll have to flag someone down just to get a drink (and it'll take 15 minutes to get to you). The staff has an attitude and it's not friendly. They tried turning away customers 30 minutes before closing and doing only take out. Sorry, you are open so serve people. The only reason I didn't give this place 1 star is because of the food. It's good! So if you do not have high expectations and want good food, come for a couple hours."
fb3C8OaZGyGtXAsn-q9r2Q,1,I wouldnt advice anybody to go to this firm.... They did a terraible job on my case and i will never go back wish i would have choosen somebody else
0iMBCKrJ34LijUZ2XVov3g,1,"Came here for breakfast this morning because I liked their sandwiches while I visited southern CA. Obviously this was a mistake. I ordered egg, ham and cheese on croissant with Lee's coffee. This had to be the worst croissant sandwich I ever had. The whole thing was cold and tasteless. The croissant was dry, flat, not even close to taste like one. The egg was bland. The food left unpleasant taste in my mouth for hours and undigested. Perhaps if I would have ordered the sandwich on a baquette, it would be better, but I won't be back for breakfast here any time soon. If anything worth your money, the service and coffee are good though. If you want a croissant sandwich, go to BK instead."
Tz7awIF3xpoBy6sqwwAasg,5,"What we gonna do right here is go back...back in time  to when the only CREAM  location was in Berkeley...Here's my CREAM Berkeley review back in 2011:

http://www.yelp.com/biz/cream-berkeley-5

The time where they used to use Otis Spunkmeyer cookies and Double Rainbow ice cream...true story! Workers said so, and I even snapped a photo of the proof!
  ...Back then, a CREAM cookie sandwich was just $1.50...Back then, it was a cool experience and a great concept.

Fast forward to 2015, multiple franchises in Cali, and CREAM's first out of state location right here in Summerlin. The crowds came out with great anticipation for their grand opening waiting for just about an hour to get their hands on their own customized cookie sandwich. Using their foolproof ordering system, I went with White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies(you may mix and match if you wish) Coconut Ice Cream, and no additional toppings. 

I had no issues with my order, as my cookies were soft and warm, and I got a generous scoop. What kinda threw us off though is that when we were done, Wifey asked if they were using the same cookies and ice cream like their flagship location, and almost immediately, two employees went on the defensive and denied EVER using Otis Spunkmeyer and Double Rainbow. They later stated that it may have happened at their other locations, but never at their first location.(Ummm...take a look at my photo!) What they say they use now is the owner's proprietary recipes for both the cookies and ice cream.

Whatever the matter is, I think CREAM will do well and survive the growing pains in Vegas because there's always a crowd searching for a dessert spot that won't break the bank. Hopefully team CREAM can iron out their inconsistencies because judging by the reviews, you're already off to a shaky start. ALOHA!!!

64QmpBse3BKv5cR_XPQqFA,5,We went on September 29th during our weekend stay in Las Vegas.  We were looking for diner type breakfast as we were staying off the strip. I have to recommend this place as our entire group liked it and we were all pleased with the food and service. The prices are reasonable and you get a great portion for your meal. We will be back when visiting Vegas
qhgO-QeQMtcVW8XN_FkEMA,4,"I definitely wanted to check out what all the hype is about and decided to give Sweets Raku a go! I was able to make it on a Sunday afternoon before they opened and was the first customer to be seated.

The restaurant itself is very quaint and modern, with a pretty crazy bathroom that has an automatic lid lifting bidet and unique sink. The associates in the store are all very friendly. After reviewing the menu and learning about the 12 dollar minimum per guest (you've been warned) I opted for the Carib and Mars. 

The pastry chef creating the dessert was meticulous and extremely detailed with the creation. From the careful color spraying of the Mars dish to the piping of each part of the Carib cup, it was like watching an art piece come together. However, the disappointment was mainly with the flavor of the desserts even though they looked so pretty. The Mars white chocolate dome gets a nice dosage of flaming cognac to melt the chocolate and expose the inner ingredients. I felt as though I was just eating a super fancy yogurt, because the base had some granola and the ""filling"" was topped with two berries. The Carib cup was covered with a chocolate kid and then some hot filling is poured on top to drizzle through the lid and into the cup. The flavor was not good nor bad, but I just found it odd to mix coconut panna cotta with hazelnut, mango, and melon. 

Overall, this would not be a place I would wait 30+ minutes like some people did. I also ended up spending about 30 bucks for two people. If you're into the experience and nice looking foods, then I would highly recommend visiting at least once."
mseo718dq5xT2qyekOCx6Q,5,"I love these from Banzo, and the new place is Supreme. I got the delicious batata falafel,  my friend had an excellent vegan version of it. Both were great. A desert named Basbusa (some kind of honey cake) sent both of us home smiling. Really friendly service, two thumbs up."
WXGdX7MuCx9cVqdP-gVTow,4,"Great place for BREAKFAST! 
They serve hot Omeletts until 11:30! The reason why we went here is crepes! They serve sweet and savory, we picked strawberry-ricotta and banana-strawberry, yummy  
I think $22 per person is pretty fair. You can get some eggs with meat and potato, crepes for dessert, coffee, fruits and salads. Seems like same price in regular breakfast place, but here you can also go around and try other desserts, seafood and bakery! 
I would definitely come again!"
l-wfeYKBi8UEBe6OB-soYg,5,"Wow... I've been curious about the whole ""create your own pizza in front of you"" concept for awhile, and this was not only neat to see, it was definitely great pizza.  

Ordered up a pretty non-traditional BBQ chicken pizza, and watched as they pulled out the dough, pressed it in a machine, topped it off generously, and then finally sent it to the gas-oven to get cooked.  The final 12-inch pie that came out was super thin with a slight limp on the crust near the center, and crisp on the very outer edge.  

Flavorful, fast, and quite fresh, I have to say this is some great pizza!  While some articles have the owner maketing this as ""neapolitan like"", I'd have to disagree and say that this is pretty far from a traditional neapolitan style pizza...

But that doesn't make it bad.... to the contrary, the pizza is delicious from crust to toppings.  If only I had more free time in Vegas, I would've come back for a few more meals.

Verdict:  If you're looking for a purist Neapolitan pie, this isn't it.  But if you want some delicious pizza that's fast, fresh, and flavorful, you've found your place.  It's a shame a gem like this is hidden in the lower levels of MGM.  I hope your business goes well and I look forward to coming back for more pizzas!"
DfNpAypVtuhA0wvV8wddzA,5,"I received quick and friendly service at lunch hour for a sit down. I had the original ramen du porc. It was good and in good portion. I enjoyed it. You get a whole egg which was a nice surprise because most places, esp. living in NYC you get half!"
0qKdpRR7nsro_Q09_TQoHQ,5,I love this place since the first opointment . The owner is amazing . She knows exactly what your hair needs. I strongly recommend this place!!!
izSOMhCAkVbCq1Onnkb-gw,5,"I've heard about this place from friends and after a month, I decided to make it to give it a try on my regular trips to Vegas and I am glad I did.

So the wait is about as horrible as everyone says.  If you go during the busy times, which is anything around regular meal times, expect the wait to be at least 2 hours.  I heard the light times are only around 3am or so.  One time I went at 3pm and it was only 1.5 hours wait.  Yeah, that is considered short during regular times.  Ever since I tried this place, I make sure I go there whenever I am in town.

Onto the main part of the review, the food!

Gumbo - Definitely order the seafood and get extra crab and lobster and sausage, even though the regular portions are generous enough, but I like more food in my gumbo than usual.  I only go for the level 2 or 3 spicy because I have heard some horror stories about how spicy it can get once you go to 4 and beyond.  I think 9 and 10 might just be inedible to most mortals.  It goes very well with the scoop of rice you get, but it can get very filling.  I don't think I have ever finished a whole bowl and I have always had to take home half.

Jambalaya - It's not a soup/stew but rather, a dry rice cooked in Cajun spices and served heaping with seafood.  It's less salty and filling than the gumbo but that doesn't mean I can finish a whole bowl either.

Raw Oysters - Definitely get it.  Their yellow band oysters are some of the biggest I have ever seen.  The oysters are juicy and plump and delicious.

Raw Mussels - While the flavors are saltier and sharper than an oyster, it also has a crunchier texture.  I didn't like it as much as the oysters and I can go either way on this, but I think I would just get more raw oysters instead.

They give you a fresh baked sourdough roll and butter.  I don't even bother eating it because I want to save room for the food.  However, when I did eat it, it was perfectly baked with the crunchy exterior coupled with a soft and warm interior.  I like their wine selection as well, even if it's not that extensive, but you don't need a big complicated wine list when what they have is picked to work with their food anyway."
N2550Ig4V8t85ewcV4p4kA,3,"My wife and I have passed this place numerous times this past year and the parking lot was always full,  Well today I purchased a $10 coupon for $1.60 and decided to try the food.  What we have found in our travels is that Mexican food varies greatly from the Chicago area to North Dakota to Denver and now Phoenix.  I really enjoy seafood soup, but have not found it yet, and not here.  I settled for the veggie and meatball soup which was only fair.  THe street tacos were steak and mexican sausage.  Taste was very good, yet they were extremely greasy,  My wife ordered a chimmichanga which had the sour cream and quacamole she loves.  Everything was smothered in sauce and topped with a mound of sour cream.  THe rice and beans were the standard fare served at every Mexican restaurant.  She said it was okay but not great, The best part of our experience was our service.  THe staff was very attentive and our drinks were kept full without asking,  Even now I don't know why the place is always packed after eating there,  One thing I am learning about the Phoenix food scene is that overall food seems to be not on par with what I've had back both in the east and midwest and is generally overpriced,  Overall I'd give Phoenix 2 stars so far for food, but our search continues for good food at fair prices."
fZ_avGBv_RJv5-r8h3kPzQ,1,Baskin Robbins must have changed their scoop sizes but apparently they charge the same price. I used to come to this location as a preference over all other ones because they are nice and the servings were decent but I just left here and got a two scoop Sunday and either the guy used the wrong scoopers or they use smaller scoopers because my Sunday didn't even fill half the container. I guess this is just another business like all the rest that charge you the same amount of money but give you less. It's a shame the customers are always on the losing end when that happens. Smh.
c3P0xyKrsleZdsIo4EioaQ,4,"Had the Salmon on top of mixed greens with a honey chili vinaigrette.  It was delicious.  Tiffany, the bar maid had a great personality"
2pnPqW1xrumam_p-1zGsmg,4,"Four stars huh? Well yeah...this place deserves it today. I had a couple rolls they make called the CLT roll and the Captain's Roll which were very tasty indeed. I happen to like spicy...both of these rolls have a common spice in using jalapeño peppers either sliced or diced. In addition, the tuna in both dishes was of good flavor and texture. I should clarify that the Captains Roll wasn't really a roll...it was more of a sashimi with yellowtail tuna in ponzu sauce, with sliced jalapeños on top.

Either way, it was exactly what I was looking for in a lunch. Consider this fact as well that this is a sushi place, IN AN AIRPORT, IN NORTH CAROLINA...not what you are expecting to find down this way.

Prices were reasonable for airport food. The wait staff was both attentive and friendly. Interesting considering that they seemed to be employed by HMS Host and I have had rather unpleasant dealings with that company in the past. Either way, I had a waitress/bartender that did an excellent job of both making recommendations and ensuring I had what I needed to enjoy a great meal..

I have eaten here a couple other times in the past and the food/delivery of service have been consistent experiences.

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone with an hour or longer layover at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport."
3TaLBTzA_R3spxiNKwiCFA,4,"Again, this was another location I saw on Food TV that begged me to stop in and gorge myself. All I remembered from the program was a pastrami sandwich piled high enough to scale like a mountain. Things like this are typically enough to sell me on eating somewhere. 

The location is small, and if it weren't for the colorful signage out front, you'd be likely to drive right past it without noticing. I'm going to assume most people drive through since there isn't much parking or seating to be had. But I went on a Monday afternoon, so there wasn't much traffic to worry about. 

They've got a big menu. It's one of those gargantuan menus that has so many options you spend the next 10 minutes second-guessing yourself and drooling over every possible item. I kept getting lost in the damn thing, so I went with what I planned on getting: something with pastrami in it. The Reuben called out to me, so I ordered one up along with a small order of spicy Cajun shoestring fries. 

They've definitely got the best Reuben that I know of in Vegas. The problem is that while eating one, I have no choice but to compare it to others I've eaten... and it gets slayed when stacked up against Canter's (in L.A.) or Katz's (in NYC). But I realize those aren't the most fair comparisons because those establishments are the thing of legend. The sandwich was piled high with a mountain of pastrami hidden beneath a couple slices of crisp rye bread, a generous portion of kraut and some brown mustard. I inhaled it in under 10 min. 

The fries were well-seasoned, but I'm not a big fan of the shoestring variety. They tend to get way too crispy, so it's like I'm eating crispy Chinese noodles or something. I like a big steak fry; something that commands respect on the plate. 

The guys working here were all extremely friendly and patient with how long it took my gf and I to peruse the menu. I need to come back to try their shakes, which are apparently just as worth making the trip as their sandwiches."
GxHGmA2aKcIKXTTRlfIXtg,4,"Very accommodating, the host let us have a table with a better view when requested, the bartender made our group cocktails not on the menu, and the waitress gave a sparkler in cotton candy for a birthday celebration. Menu is not current on open table. Would recommend dressinh up if you're going."
lCd2TFIPOh9TXJBQw5LpIw,1,"This is the absolute worst ""fine dining"" experience I've ever had in my entire life. The food was all right in my opinion -- definitely not worth the price, though. The service was the worst part of all. Not only was I embarrassed, but irritated, sad, and about ready to slap some one across the face. First off, EVERY SINGLE hostess is a size 0 - 2. Don't get me wrong, I do realize some restaurants go for a certain look, but hear me out for a second. They were all wearing dresses SO close to their rears, that I doubt they would even bend over. Walking in, the interior was EXTREMELY nice, and had me excited to be seated, but then I saw OUR seats. We were seated in the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen. Our decor looked about 40 years older than the decor in the rest or the restaurant, and there were only four tables spaced evenly ONE FOOT APART. I was a little disappointed, but thought nothing of it -- seeing as I hadn't scanned the restaurant yet. I was lead to the bathroom by a waiter, and to my surprise the only part of the restaurant that wasn't eccentricly decorated was those four little tables in the back. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I felt like yesterdays shell fish. I felt personally discriminated against for my weight, especially since the other three tables were of people the same size. I felt like we didn't fit ""their mold"", so they just stuck us in the back. I will never, ever, EVER, be coming here again, and will advise anyone not to either. I had more fun at the five minute free water show across the street. Waste of $300."
F-bAwyVq_JNrBoMsDZJmnA,5,Without a doubt its the best coffee I have had in Toronto. I really like too the price you see is the price you pay. It also has a great atmosphere the upstairs is a nice place to study or catch up with friends. Friendly staff keep it up!
FcED2d9ZnNX78cohokJgzA,1,"Manager is a complete jerk. Customer service means nothing. I came in for dinner and drinks while restaurant  area was almost empty. I was told I could not sit at a booth because there were only two of us and we would need at least four. His reasoning was ""it might get busy"". Instead we were seated at a small table where the game we were there for was almost impossible to see.  Pretty much every request was answered with NO for the entire meal by the waitress.  I had multiple experiences like this and finally had enough. I would go to the Tilted Kilt  or Arena just a few blocks away"
_f4gCK7BcVx4xT5ObLFwMg,5,"The place is very clean and everyone was friendly. The food is fresh and tasty. All four of us were pleased with our meals. 

Laura waited on us and she was attentive and friendly. She knew the menu well and made good suggestions."
AAg2UdmpNMXA935HuE_kpw,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Amelie's French Bakery. You can find me there anytime of day, even 3am working on a website or clients SEO. They have the best Asparagus Leek Soup and all the goodies are to die for!"
IQq3lcA615rWbmAyQZkoHw,5,Great food and service.  Fish was just the way I like it. Very pleasant waitress. Will definitely go back!
gY86hMUHrzhzazHeZszy4A,3,"Some days I just need something to pick me up. Usually a trip to Marshall's does it. Where else can I roll a too small plastic shopping cart and be able to toss into it almost any thing that makes me smile. A bright winter scarf, TOSS, a Brazilian cook book, TOSS, an iPad leather case, TOSS, a tiny pig whisk, TOSS, a jar of marmalade, TOSS. Rarely will my cart full of never before seen together things cost more than $100. Others may turn to alcohol but I turn to Marshall's for escape. My house is a bit cluttered tho."
orGMNI8kGv7VmAPUhALjpA,1,"These people have no idea what they are doing. I called them four times in two days and never got anything done. I called inquiring about Internet and the hopper. The lady was telling me how expensive it is and it's really for people whomcant get anything else. So I asked her "" do you work for this company "" they all kept trying to talk me out of everything I was thinking about ordering. Then day 2 I called and they didn't have any of my info right. They wouldn't even help me with my own account. When I asked to speak to a manager the girl told me it would be 20 minutes before I could speak with one. After I had already been on the phone for 30 minutes and accomplished nothing. I am only staying with them because it is convenient for me not to do the whole hassle of changing. But ifnyounare thinking of getting them, go with direct tv!!!!"
cmjhMrJYf2pvPDZWi5xwVA,1,"I took my mother here for her 80th birthday, and we were both very disappointed with the restaurant.  If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE!  For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera.  The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served.  Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entrée.  No one wants to eat their salad, while their entrée is getting cold.  Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals!  He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera.  It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing!  My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery.  All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed!  Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals.  We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake!  It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant.  We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections.  They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, crème brulee, and cheesecake.  Instead they served all ice cream desserts that you would find at a pizza or burger joint.  Who wants grilled banana bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert at a fine dining restaurant?  I have never seen a restaurant so empty for dinner!  Do yourself a favor and pick somewhere else to go!"
yTqQpJCU7vi9mmdcz7fBfw,2,"OK, where do I start? Oh yes, the reservation. Called in a reservation for a company dinner this Sunday for last night which never hit the books. So our party including execs had to sit at the 'community table' which my manager was not excited about, thanks, Vig.

Flash back to the valet, the parking entrance is confusing and I took an unintentional detour and then had to flag someone down after 10 minutes because they were completely ignoring me. They said they had to help the people in line, but I had been there before any of the cars arrived.

Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'. The woman who ordered wine, (me of course), had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'checking to see if they had it'.

My burger ordered medium rare was charred to a crisp that couldn't even be drowned out by the Secret Sauce. Saving grace -- the fries were good, yay.

Also, who thought that putting chipotle in everything on the menu was a good idea? Not thrilled, not going back and certainly not recommending this for any corporate or group outings.Really disappointed, I've always heard good things about The Vig and enjoyed going to the bar there."
4i1a0zGQDkmcvQQ_5ldUQQ,5,"I love this place! During my week stay I went almost everyday. Although the space is small (which I love!) it was relatively easy to find a seat. If you can't find a seat there is a beautiful plaza across the alley with lots of seats. 
All of the baristas that I interacted with were very nice and made me feel very welcomed. They were able to answer any questions that I had about the menu, as well as their coffee offerings. 
During my visit to Toronto I ordered a pour over, cortado, and espresso and all were great! I loved the complexity of the coffee and each pour over was consistent no matter which barista made it.     
Next time I find myself in Toronto I will going back as often as possible."
VWlG3LZqYBWI4xYQSsW6zw,5,Glory Bee's is easy to overlook in Frontier Town but is a gem! They have cute souvenirs but the real shop is all about the women's fashions and unique gifts. They will help find just the right outfit for any occasion. I often stop in to see what's new and get uncommon or hand made gifts for friends. A must visit for locals and visitors alike.
pevcAPClsJSo3JsCgUilZg,3,"The place had a lively atmosphere with good margaritas and excellent tacos.  The prices are a little high but that is expected for the location.

Our server was attentive, friendly, and helpful. The chips and salsa were warm."

kvFicNdaPbtxwhe2YPoQgw,4,"Going to keep it short and sweet:
Plenty of TV's
Outdoor beer garden seating (with TV's outside)
Divey-ish atmosphere inside
GREAT craft beer selection
Food is above average for this type of establishment
Reasonably priced"
yXg5SBNYdxN1zWdhws6xOA,5,Gary did a phenomenal job serving both an OOP and an Injunction Against Harassment to my soon to be ex-husband and his girlfriend. He walked me through the process and was very communicative on when and how he served the two individuals. Plus he got it done within a couple days. Highly recommend him to anyone needing this kind of service. His pricing was fair and I felt very comfortable with giving him the paperwork.
mn7vmisQEG85uyzZGxdUAg,2,"I got here around 4:45 and I was the only customer. I ordered a cheese burger combo and a side of thousand island, it came out to about $9. It was $8 and change, im not exactly sure of the price cause the girl at the register threw away my receipt and didn't offer it  to me. The cheese burger wasn't bad. It's the same burger you can get frome the burger shoppe, nothing special. The reason for the 2 stars was definitely for the food. I figured since I was the only one there the food should be nice and warm. The burger was fresh but the fries were cold. Not even warm! There is no way they made those for me. It was definitely not worth the price. I'm not sure if I'll be back."
QyjhKtz0m9K3NbVAvp162g,5,"I *LOVE* this place!  The staff is always very friendly and the pizza is awesome.  I love that you can mix the sauces or do half n half on pizzas.  The toppings are fresh and tasty and the price is great.  Can't beat under $10 for a fresh pizza with whatever toppings you want on it.  I just wish there was one closer to work/home.....then again, I'd probably be 400 lbs cause I'd eat there all the time!"
dMUTmcu410YfwakQGESaEw,4,"Stopped in on the way home from vacation and had a great dinner. The brisket had great flavor.  I will admit though, I wasn't a fan of the baked beans."
i7LNaiIuKhNH4l0w3WbQaA,3,"I'm torn about this spot... The food is average. The beer selection is good. The location is great. 

First, the food... Your run of the mill bar grub -- burgers, hotdogs, fries. You would think the chili would steal the show but it's really pretty bland and lacks that pizazz or spice I enjoy in a good chili. 

Next, the beer selection... Lots of great, local choices on draft. 20 choices, to be exact. I like that they offer flights because I am indecisive and like to sample lots! 

Lastly, the location... I love Brevard Court. It reminds me of a little alley in Europe. It's really an oasis right in the heart of uptown Charlotte. The interior of QCBC is nice, too. Lots of sleek wood. High top tables and a few seats at the bar. It's teeny-tiny though, so if anything is happening uptown (especially a Knights Game) expect a packed house. 

So, moral of this story is, I wish they'd up their food game. I would be inclined to visit more if there was something I really loved and craved on the menu."
yXdkMlDtzRwkC-lbYpZHOA,1,"We got there at 5 we were only table there, should have been a warning sign. We were a party of five. We had spinach artichoke, ok I think costco ' s is better. Also calamari, the calamari should have been tossed from freezer 6 months ago. It was dried like jerky. One person said her chicken was ok. My wife got the beef stew pasta. To much sugar she didnt even eat half. My son got the clams with pasta. He ate the clams. My daughter and I had the lasagna. OK we were only table early, my sauce on the lasagna was covering the the plastic wrap they cooked on it. When we left the host asked how was it. Really bad,. The service was outstanding not the food. No plate cleaners nobody even got passed half way."
IBYnCZ2kAbPRJK4Kg4_UkQ,3,"I am new to the world of crocheting and knitting, but have come to love both.  When I visited Gail Knits a few weeks ago, I was in search of a crochet/yarn store in which I could frequent for supplies and advice.  Upon entering, there were tables with knitters having their lunch and knitting their projects, none of which looked up in my direction.  I asked a woman in the back for help to choose a yarn which was for a house slipper project.  She was quite helpful and I learned some things.  But, her tone was neither friendly or negative, it was monotone and uncaring, more towards monotone and ""I could really care less.""  She did invite me to come knit in their store at any time, but I probably will not take up the offer since I felt borderline, unwelcome.  I gave this store 3 stars because her customer service was the bare minimum of what is needed to feel welcome in a ""local type"" store.  Their selection of yarn and knitting supplies are wonderful.  I could not spot any crochet supplies.  I was under the impression it was a strictly knitting environment I had entered."
Yn4k3XfCHPB__RmxzfIhtA,3,"OK, so as a new tea drinker I felt I needed to check the place out, even though other Yelpers have given fair warning about the staff and prices.  My 2 experiences have been different from what has been mentioned.  Staff were friendly but not pushy, prices were as expected (they are in a high end mall, folks - the rent must be paid) and the tea was fine.  I liked that they would make a cuppa of whatever they sold (rather than ""this is the flavor of the day"") and even though $4.99 is a bit steep for a cuppa, it is a one-time leaning experience and is helpful in learning whether you want to take this tea home or not.  The only warning I might give is that, in one case, they added a bit of rock sugar to the store sample pot of the mixed chai, so it is sweeter than the actual tea that you might buy."
jTqh5NYfEVlmr9fGDhb6dA,2,Ordering online is such a bitch!!!! And they do not offer the same specials as in store?! Makes no sense. I do love papa johns tho. The staff is nice
N3dFjIewvGBMVygGs2Brdg,3,"I went here earlier this week and was pleased with my experience. It was very clean and my nail tech was a sweet lady who was easy to talk to despite the language barrier and did not harass me about getting more designs/services. I got gel acrylics and she really took her time on them, particularly because it was a slow day and I was literally the only customer in the salon for almost 3/4 of the time I was there. The total cost for my nails before the tip was $42, and although it's a little pricey I didn't really care because of how much I liked the way my nails turned out."

_EGUpcyxdGkRkmx0KsWfPQ,3,"This place wasn't easy to find, unless you know exactly where it is. It is located at the back of St. Lawrence market. I ordered their lobster roll and it was good, but still missing some uniqueness from it. I can taste the freshness of the lobster, it came with some fries and coleslaw on the side. The size was not the best thing on the menu. Seating is weirdly laid out there, and there is additional seating outside of the market. Overall the food is worth a try if you are around the area.

Service: 3/5
Food: 3/5
Environment 3/5

LKqRZp3EThHP3ETi4y2DaQ,1,"Cheap medical supply company, do not trust with getting time sensitive medical equipment in an orderly fashion. Do not communicate well with patients,no explanations of benefits to the patient just a bill saying pay X amount now. Order was never shipped at beginning of month because I had ""paperwork"" to complete...too bad I was never notified about this form. Save your time and energy, if your insurance company makes you work with this company refuse or find a new brand of product to use would not recommend edgepark medical to anyone"
frZQ-ylFx-8ByzP_-1IC3g,4,Slot machines greet you as you de-plane but there's no smoking allowed in the common areas thankfully.  There are smoking rooms available which are well ventilated.  I didn't smell smoke as I passed them.  Plenty of eateries to choose from. Clear signage.  Helpful airport personnel.
iL-YmtzfcN8WaaFpt5DUBw,1,"Stopped in here because I needed an oil change and my car had been leaking some oil. 2 hours and $500 later the leak is fixed and my oil was changed. I knew they were ripping me off but I wanted it fixed that day. What they charge for labor is absolutely ridiculous. Almost $400 of my bill was labor. But that's how they get you. 

The people working here are friendly. Probably won't go back again."
zD-h6WluHwx_H6jr_LkeNw,5,I forgot to bring my lunch at work so i decided to order food but didn't want anything unhealthy. I was so happy to find this sub place on grub hub and they deliver! I have to say my sandwich is amazing. I got the club sub meal and added jalapenos and instead of mayo did the chipotle. SO GOOD. I will definitely be eating here again.
dTsOtqEUF3WXAMhAk3pOtQ,2,Service was not so great. The burger was tasty but the hand cut fries were soggy... Not worth it. Had to wait 45 minutes for the food... Won't be back.
CIEpeaGmFfW_v3CYjNSkZQ,3,"First time at this particular Smashburger location. The service was friendly and attentive. Chatty staff, but not overly so. 

I came here with my mom and our food came out quickly after we ordered. My chicken was cooked well and was moist, but overly salty. Everything else was great and we were in and out for dinner in less than 30 minutes."
VkkxHkS0WKfrqcCoWpO7ZA,5,"Came here last night for dinner. So happy they added good salads to the menu and an actual wine list (including rose!) that was definitely missing from the last restaurant in this location. Started with the crispy Brussel sprouts and had the blackened salmon salad, very impressed. We'll be back."
enc6pSFiltufcpy0-6A9ng,1,"One star. It's only because they won't let me give it zero stars. Read this carefully, if you book your room through a third party, such as Orbitz, they do not guarantee the room that you booked online. Traveled with my brother and booked a two double bed room and when we arrived all they had were rooms with a single king bed. Was told by the front desk I could get a roll away bed brought into the room at an extra charge of $10 a night if they had any available. Didn't matter whether they had any available or not because I had no intention of giving this place any more of my money. I travel often and I mean i travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever had this happen to me. I have stayed in nicer hotels at cheaper prices and haven't dealt with this kind of problem ever. Needless to say I have crossed all Hilton hotels off my traveling list. Also, room was tiny, small fridge, breakfast was not free where as in most places I stay it's complimentary. Bath tub floor was slick, tried to be careful didn't matter because I busted my you know what in the shower. Just an all around poor experience and I will not be back. One last thing, you hear everything that happens in the hallways no matter what's going on and that sucks when you are trying to sleep."
XhHjJJh3MkhfECmzLSQBgA,1,Total dump. Rotten ass kids running around. Kids throwing rocks and broke my patio window. Cockroaches everywhere because ppl here are so nasty. Pool is closed 99% of the time for no reason. Don't believe anything that they say or pics on website. It's a total shit hole. Stay as far away as you can. Completely ghetto property.
OxADh6qdniixaqhJKqfXsw,5,"This is my new favorite spot in Vegas; this is the first Vegas hotel that truly doe not feel like Vegas. It has a such a great look to it and it is truly designed to explore. I really want to give a bad review so people will stay away and I can keep it all to myself. So, many secrets on every level though that I will leave for other to discover. But, for now it gets 5 stars and I really want to have a staycation here this summer."

I mean, it's not in the protective bubble of South Charlotte, and I did arrive with 6 other 40-somethings dressed in pirate garb. (After all, it WAS National Talk Like a Pirate Day!) But my fears dissolved when I was greeted by the friendliest drinkers I've encountered in a long time (and on a Sunday night too!). It's just fun. Really nice people. Really nice 24 oz. cans of PBR (haven't seen such a thing since 1983), and a bartender who's a perfect combo of Zoey Deschanel and Katy Perry.  The other wenches I was with got the Bloody Mary's, which seemed to please. I stuck with beer and enjoying the other patrons. Thanks, T.B. for a great time!"
w5ch6MNOFjITRaUD65104g,5,What a wonderful zoo!  We go here once a year and currently on year 6!  It's usually an all day event for us and we pack a cooler full of drinks and healthy snacks.  This year the elephants are new but the dinosaurs are gone.  They've revamped the lower level of the rainforest.
L5TS21ICHInFdZCLwO2DtA,4,It was a psychotically good idea to blend Mexican and Chinese foods - the flavors all work together fantastically. Also recommend getting a black bean burrito to round out your meal - spicy and full of flavor.
uD9jIRfvvOKft0adWz5HbA,5,"This is a Pittsburgh fave in Southside.  Come hungry, portions are enormous and reasonably priced. We had the Southside Slope, Original Cheesesteak, & pierogis.  Sandwiches & Headwiches come with House Chips - no substitutions allowed.  If you want fries or rings, you have to order separately as a side.  Everything was good!  Service was outstanding, although it wasn't very busy.  Great beers, good atmosphere!  Definitely worth visiting!"
SP-nfY9HLt2nt-Gp869Pcg,2,"We have gone here once before, a couple years ago, and really enjoyed the food and vibe. They have several vegetarian options which is surprisingly hard to find in Madison, so that's automatic points. But tonight we went back at 8pm, got seated, and proceeded to be ignored for 15 minutes by everyone. No water, no ""I'll be with you in just a minute"", nothing at all. We walked out and the hostess was very apologetic, but seriously...went up to Brasserie V and got served within 2 minutes. Two stars instead of one because the hostess clearly felt bad."
JsUUP4TY1ZoXRta_erpZzg,2,"If you're going here to see some Gretzky memorabilia, you'll see it.  If you're see to watch sports, you'll see that.  If you're here for great tasting food or reasonable prices, you will be disappointed.

In other words, it is what it is - a tourist spot designed to prey on your love of The Great One and to separate you from as many dollars and/or looneys as possible. The atmosphere is cold and stark. The wait staff is instructed to move you out as quickly as possible. The beer selection is mediocre at best.  You probably won't see any reason to return after one visit.

Of note, there used to be a bubble hockey game in the corner, but they took that out, probably to squeeze in an extra table or two."
HfRaCymqn35BJ0uGlrKZmg,5,"This place is a gem. Absolutely everything I've tasted here was delicious, from the iced jasmine tea to the main entrees. I'm glad to have another vegetarian/vegan restaurant option of this caliber in town.

We started off the meal with the Fresh Summer Rolls, followed by the Lotus Salad, an order of Stir Fried Noodles and the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. The rolls were large and quite filling on their own. Next, we split an order of Lotus Salad; with fresh squeezed lime on top it was divine. Crisp, crunchy and cool... perfect for a summer lunch. The Stir Fried Noodles were very good too, but the real standout was the Kung Pao Soy Chicken... I couldn't stop eating it! We finished everything and I was very satisfied. The interior is immaculate and service is very friendly. I will definitely be adding this restaurant to my rotation of favorites..."
xRoMMuH4Gf0TkTTrRMlJRg,4,"This place is unique and fun. My boyfriend and I went here with another couple right before the Indians game for some beers, tots, and hot dogs. The sauces you can order are memorable. Make it fun and order a bunch! I enjoyed their tater tots but only because of the sauces. Besides that, they weren't too memorable. They have an excellent beer selection and their hot dogs are unique. Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed!"
2o2wACPx8qpvr9CRRtl8kg,5,"Came to Le Dolci for a staff fun day and we had a blast decorating cupcakes (and eating many as well). They provided lots of materials (fondant, decorations, cutters, etc) and just let us go wild on our creations. The actual classes they run monthly are more instructional but also just as hands on I hear.

The cupcakes are super yummy as well. I tried a chocolate and buttercream and the salted caramel (mmm). They were nice and light, but also moist. The icing wasn't too sweet which is something I'm not a big fan of.

Definitely a fun idea for a office party, bachelorette or girl's day. The staff are all very friendly, informative and do a great job in making sure you are having a blast. Like their facebook page to receive news on contests as well!"

bv9MbeudEMJA_8idJ3K-yA,4,"Pacific East in Solon is not much different rom Pacific East in Cleveland.  Fair quality, gigantic portions, and fair prices.

The boyfriend and I found ourselves in Solon running errands for a friend, and decided to grab dinner there.  Maybe we were in the wrong part of town, but dinner options seem to be a bit limited in Solon.  We chose Pacific East because we love sushi and because we had a decent experience at the Cleveland location.

Upon first entering the establishment, we were turned off by the intense fishy smell.  It was seriously overpowering....I wanted to turn around and leave, but the boyfriend convinced me to stay.  The place was completely empty except for two other customers.  It appears that this location used to be a Wendy's or Roy Roger's, or some other fast-food joint.  It has those curved windows that you often see at said establishments.  The decor inside was pretty plain.

Service was friendly and prompt.  Our water glasses were kept full and our server repeatedly checked in to see if we needed anything.  I suppose this is a benefit of dining in an empty restaurant.

For our meal, we chose to split the ""Bridge for Two"" which contains 14 pieces of nigiri, 22 pieces of sashimi, a spicy tuna roll, and a California roll.  It is served with house salad and miso soup for two as well.  Total cost?  $50.  The miso soup was a tad on the salty side, but still flavorful.  The salad was the typical salad you get a sushi restaurants: iceburg, cucumber, tomato, and ginger dressing.

When our ""bridge"" arrived, it was beautifully presented.  The sushi chef obviously took pride in the presentation.  The amount of fish on it was actually a bit daunting.  The chef did not skimp on the cuts of fish.  The fish on the nigiri was literally hanging off both ends of the rice.  The sashimi was cut into huge slices.  The rolls were completely stuffed with goodies.  I normally don't even like rolls, but I devoured these without a problem.  We were hardly able to finish the entire meal, but didn't want to waste good food, so we made ourselves uncomfortably full.  It was worth it.

The quality of the fish was good, but not great.  While we had much variety, some of the fish seemed a bit dull.  None of it tasted bad by any means, just not as fresh and flavorful as it could have been.  I was quite pleased that the fish was served at the perfect temperature, too.

Would I go out of my way to grab sushi here?  No, probably not.  But it's good, especially for the area."

JIUJfqyFIQkjLS86SsQUFA,5,"Fantastic and well worth the money!

My Eskie is really wary of grooming but Galloping Groomers made it so easy!  They arrived early, let me walk her before she went in and Tina was so sweet with her that this was the least stressful grooming she's ever had! Highly recommended!"
3pNJqsvNRMuX-V4p4j5OcQ,5,"Brunch was amazing.  I tried the quiche Lorraine was on point. For dessert, we had the thin pancake (I'd call it a crepe) with butter poached pears.  The amazing cinnamon butter smell alone was enough to give me the best sugar high of the trip."
xiZXBzbbruzWKfg_OsOM_w,4,"I was in town for two days and our hotel recommended this place, calling it ""updated Southern."" We were a little disappointed when we walked in, because it looked corporate and impersonal - everything that we didn't want. 

But then I saw the menu.  There were so many really interesting looking things on it that I wish I was with a bigger group so there could have been more ordering and sharing. I ended up starting with a goat cheese, beet and orange salad. With those ingredients, you can't really go wrong, and they didn't. 

For dinner, I had scallops that were encrusted with bacon crumbs on top of a pumpkin bread crustini. Really amazing flavors between the bacon, scallops and the pumpkin. My colleague also really enjoyed his pecan encrusted trout. 

Bottom line: boring corporate setting, the opposite of boring food."
55YSQ9lHS6REj9Ld60GMvA,3,"I came here for a dinner a few days ago on a weekday with 2 other people. The service could be faster but there was only one waitress and one hostess/waiter? It was my fault for saying we wanted all the food at the same time. I feel like if the dishes came out as they were prepared, we wouldn't have had to wait ~20 minutes for the food. 

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It had the bar area like Jack Astor's and the booths like Milestones with dim lighting. If you're a sports fan, they position the TV's all around the place so no matter where you're sitting, you can watch the action.

The menu was standard American food (with some Mexican dishes) with similar pricing compared to competitors. We ordered the following items:

8oz. Top Sirloin - $25.49 - Ordered medium rare and it was cooked between rare to medium rare. I was satisfied with the quality of the meat. It could be more tender but you can't expect too much at this price point. The portion of the baked potato it came with was very generous. More generous than any other restaurant I've been to. Same goes for the side of vegetables.

Blackened Basa - $22.99 - Generous layer of guac on top. Dish was flavourable and wasn't overly salty. The only thing I would say to improve the dish is to cut down the level of blackening (is this a verb?). It dries the fish out a lot.

Baked Onion Soup - $8.49 - Liked the flavour of the soup, not overly salty or strong in onion flavour, did not like the thickish layer of cheese on top of it. 

Basa Fish Tacos $16.49 w/ quinoa and arugula salad + $1.99 - I feel like if they used another type of fish, it would taste better. I wasn't a fan of the chipotle honey dressing but I'm biased towards not liking spicy food. I wouldn't order this dish again because the two other mains tasted much better. The salad, on the other hand, was delicious. I liked the dressing it came with.

10 pc. Fryers (Wings) with Signature NY Butter Sauce - $13.99 -The only reason why I ordered this dish was because I was curious as to what this sauce would taste like. It ended up tasting like it was only coated with butter. I was fine with it but I know a lot of people wouldn't be. I find this dish to be not worth the price because the size of the wings were so small. Plus they only give 2 pieces of carrots and celery for one order.

The total came about to $122 incl. tips and taxes for 3 people. Is that too pricey? You be the judge. I would come back again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to persuade people to eat here."
qgZ0w9_0NtvHojSUPIa8TA,3,"I've been to this place 6~7 times, and the only reason why I come here is because it's in my building. Prices don't justify their average food and I agree with Eddie that the owner likes to charge for everything extra. One time I asked for some extra pickles and he wanted to charge me 5 dollars (a small container's worth). This is my first time being asked to pay for some extra pickles at an Arabic restaurant in Mississauga. 

Another time when I got 8 falafels, I asked the owner for more tahini sauce because one very small container of taihini didn't seem enough to cover all the falafels. He seemed unimpressed and told me that they give only 1 container of tahini for every 4 falafels - proving to himself that he should have given me 2 containers of tahini for my 8 falafels in the first place, instead of just one! Again, this is my first time having a problem with asking for more sauce at an Arabic restaurant in Mississauga. 

Their adult children provide very good service when they're occasionally working, but overall, I strongly don't recommend this place."
v0l_phBduzprbC2Fb_i7_w,5,"They never disappoint me here! We haven't had a bad experience or a moment of disappointment. Hospitality is quick, and very accommodating. Love the concierge service, every one seems to want to serve you, nice quality to have today. 

We got to stay in the penthouse this trip & just love love love it! 

Happy owner with Monarch now switching over to Diamond - I'm ok with it!"
LsLP5BjEbS9V_Efj3DbkNw,1,"If it were possible to give zero stars that is what I would do.  I have never experienced such poor customer service in my entire life.  We ordered a three piece sectional on February 9th and were told it would be delivered on March 12th.  We made arrangements to get rid of our existing couch and we were having a party on the 21st so the timing was going to be perfect.  On the 11th they called to confirm delivery and only upon me asking if we could deliver it on the 13th instead did I discover that only two of the three pieces were even here.  Their automated phone system is ridiculous and I received over 12 calls to confirm a partial delivery that I had cancelled.  I then called to confirm delivery of the pieces for the 31st date we had moved it to and they then told me that none of my pieces were here and that they didnt know when it would be available.  Everyone that works there could not possibly care less about customer service or taking care of issues.  I left three messages for our salesperson, Brandon, to call us and all were unreturned.  Any attempt to speak to a manager equates to long holds, responses that they are on vacation or at lunch, etc.  We are cancelling the order and will never, ever do business with this company again.  Terrrible.  Terrible.  Terrible."
rNhUpATZ1VOQ1_P7_wtdWQ,3,"Likely deserves 3 1/2 stars.  A local scene, which can be a good thing. The bowling alley upstairs is fun and well put-together, and really, the best part of the place. The restaurant by the tables is strictly hit n miss. Bring a book when you place your order, cause they must drive to Reno to pick up your food. Food itself OK; they have a pretty reputable Chinese food part of the menu. Gambling in my experience has just gotten so damn crowded. Haven't stayed in the hotel. But the ice-cream by the valet is pretty reliable."
hjizijSFae_Wd6QsL0mxdg,1,"I left Ultimate Athletics after a year of membership in early November. I wanted to separate my experience before I wrote a review. I came from an outstanding gym, Coach J Fitness located in Thornhill. We relocated into the city and so I joined Ultimate. Throughout the year I had repeatedly tried spin with Vlad, one of the owners as well as his more inexperienced staff, palates with Paula also an owner, Abs & A** with Sam, conditioning with Victoria and Vlad, boot camp with Victoria, TRX with both Paula and Barb, and Athlete with Al. Overall it was a frustrating, disappointing year. There was no redeeming value in the spin. Simply put it was awful whether taught by Vlad or one of his employees. There is way more to a spin class than blasting the music to a deafening volume and being directed to stand up, sit down and go fast. The music for the most part had little, if anything, to do with the beat of the spin. Try a spin class at Spynga with Tamar or Casey---there is no comparison. I attempted going 3-4 times a week to the above mentioned choices. My needs were specific to maintaining strength and keeping healthy. Although Victoria was more attentive than others there was little attention to correcting form or the offer of a modification according to a participant's particular needs. Vlad's consistent direction was watch, this is going to be easy ---fast fast fast. No direction or correction on selection of appropriate weights let alone correct form. Paula had a huge following for palates. I cannot comment on the quality of her classes as this is a type of class I know little about. I will say, however, that there should have been a cutoff in the number of participants allowed in a class. It was so tight you were forced to continually bump or kick your neighbour. Speaking of crowding let me address Ultimate's TRX classes. The TRX straps are attached on a bar across the centre of the room no more than 30 centimeters (1 foot) apart. The instructor bellowed from the front of the room with, once again, very little direction. You could not do a single exercise properly given the ridiculously tight space and lack of direction. Try a TRX class with Sari at Philosophy. The class is small with an intelligent cut off. Well planned and unbelievably attended by the careful watch of the instructor, Sari. You will be blown away. There is no comparison. I carefully, I thought, selected this gym because of the variety of class types offered. Throughout the year I asked when Circuit, listed as one of their offerings, was going to be on their schedule? The answer was always not at this time. A whole year passed without Circuit ever making it on to the schedule. Remember please, as I have learned, you get what you pay for. Apparently Ultimate opened charging a monthly annual commitment fee of $190.00. When I joined it had gone down to $140.00. You would have to question why? A boutique gym at Yonge and Summerhill moments to the subway and they had to significantly reduce their rate. Why? I've returned now to Coach J Fitness bringing all my injuries, thank you Ultimate, with me. I am so happy with my return to the club. Immediately all my needs were addressed and modifications were made to also accommodate my injuries with the focus on rebuilding my strength. Don't waste your time or money on this club. The only thing it has going for it is location."
L_Aeqzr3Fddcx-FLIKSGgQ,4,"I am somewhat amused that there are renters and others who do not like living in a very secure and beautiful neighborhood. We have never had trouble getting vendors and friends through the gates - there is an easy on line app that allows you to give access. If you expect strangers to drive into the community to just waltz in - that isn't going to happen. That is why people moved here. If you don't like it - please look elsewhere. This is a great place if you value safety, great rec center, beautiful walk around the golf course views, and recently many community events."
Z7xVo3SwG3eEBUAJt5Ju4A,5,"I called All Vegas Auto Glass after I was quoted a couple high prices to place my front windshield. I didn't leave a message. Joe not only called me back and left a very professional voicemail, he also texted me. We came up with $160 (which includes them coming to your house to do the work) So two of his employees showed up 10 min early and were very professional! They had my windshield completely done in 35-40 min! I was expecting at least an hour minimum! It was a very professional and efficient experience. I love my new windshield on my Acura TSX! I recommend them 150%! This is coming from a pretty high maintenance person."
yxT62qzDZdXsAzsDev7foA,5,"This is the best experience that I have ever had in a hair salon. Sharon is so professional and talented. Out of all the hair salons I have been to I can honestly say this is one that I will continuously go to for a long time. She is so good with people and really makes you feel at home. I would recommend this hair salon for everyone to go to because she really does make you feel like a diva. Sharon is not only a nice person but the way she does hair is amazing. I came in her shop looking like a hot mess  I didn't think that there was a pray that could be answered for my hair and with a perm, cut and curl she transformed me from a hot mess to a diva with success. I am so glad to know that there is a place that I can go where I can get five star service that literally makes me want to come back again and again. Thank Sharon I get nothing but compliments from co workers and friends. You are truly one of  the best and I will be seeing you soon."
2KusEh2b44_2Z6ib8BWBMQ,5,"The staff is great. Friendly and welcoming. Service was smooth during this grand opening day too. 

 We sat at the bar (you have to order at the window if you want to sit at a table). The nachos with carnitas (pork) were way delicious. Definitely happy about this location and hope they thrive"
ph7OGzPCHgGs1QKuz_WuAA,3,"I recommended this place to a friend based off the reviews here. We went with her kids and to be honest I was a tad disappointed. The bread was old and dry (one of the kids actually even refused to eat it), we took a mix of 3 entrées which for some reason I thought will be hot but they were cold, and the menu wasn't kid-friendly. The manager though (at least I think we was) was super friendly and helpful."
HV9ZGzWpaGMvpxsVk5S3FQ,2,"I came here thinking it would be great as reviewed through yelp, but realized that the service was really bad. 

We did not get the full amount of side dishes until I decided to speak Korean to the waiters. They first gave us 3 then after speaking Korean we received 3 more side dishes.

The food was mediocre considering the price range."
8VCnxYsTGh9IdU6hNPC3FQ,3,The food was great. But had to knock off a star for the service. Maybe could use another personnel be out on the floor to clean up especially on weekends. I mean why give the customer a wash cloth to clean the table themselves. Other than that it's a must to go try out the food.
qughj11pMMJCnjpLPkIGdA,4,"9 holes ,I have been going to this place last year & this year once a week. It's always great, well maintained, nice putting green. Yes I seem to loose balls in the water also. MMMMmmm? The price seems very reasonable to me."
IKmzGvXLrsyHx9k-HwI89Q,2,"Decided to check this place out for some fun during the holidays. First of all, it took 20 minutes to get in.  There was a long line and it seemed that every transaction took forever for no apparent reason. When we got inside, it was a super small rink and pretty well packed.  The rental skates were older than expected with shoddy laces. They were unlike any rental skates we'd gotten anywhere else -- no ankle support, uncomfortable fit, and left us feeling very unsteady. Maybe the wheels were loose or the style of skates were such that the front wheels were further back, but they just left us feeling dangerously unbalanced.  Would recommend heading to another skating rink instead."
7mKhFykjqNZ58ckV_a0q9g,2,"My rating is based primarily on the food, because if I gave service equal weight, I would halve the stars. Since I tend to think with my stomach, I can overlook the service in this instance and direct my rating toward the food. The meat, as well as the salad bar, was great. I stuffed myself like I was living my last day on this earth. The meat came at decent time intervals. I especially jumped at the chicken, bacon-wrapped turkey, and sausage. 

My server, however, was quite cold and rude. She flinched when we mentioned that we had the Tix4Tonight voucher, taking away our menus immediately (what if I had wanted to browse it further?). Instead of giving us tap water, which she did for the adjacent table, she handed us an Acqua Panna bottle ($6.95). Two weeks later, I am still perplexed as to why this happened (I clearly did not say bottled water). She also consistently failed to check up on us, bypassing us as she checked on her other tables. I sometimes wonder why such people decide to go into the hospitality service. Needless to say, her tip was accordingly small.


p.s. You can get a decent deal here with the Tix4Tonight booths.

p.p.s. I may have eaten almost as many fried bananas as I did meat."

I said No I had hear great reviews but never went... WOW! The setting is something out of SOHO in NYC-- very trendy but authentic... Great service and I ordered the goat cheese, wild mushroom tart ( like a mini quiche without the egg...) so very buttery and gooey and tasty.. It was divine! Don't miss out on this sophisticated cafe.... Great food and the setting is like you are in an older home for the early 1900's.. patios and lace! Love it.."

ZhKHGJpo9VGxUguVMZlOPw,4,"I love the tomato soup and the berry salad. I get extra croutons for the soup because it's the best to dip with. The berry salad is filled with blue cheese, berries, and delicious candy walnuts. Plus, the salad dressing is made with real berries. 

The wait can be long, but it's always worth it. I consider this to be one of my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas.

I want to send a extra thank you to Angelica who assisted my family. Her service was 5 star!"

The service could not be better.  I suggest trying the tasting menu with wine parings.  The ambiance is quite good, if not spectacular like Picasso next door.  Definitely not for those looking for a value, but a great place for a special night out where cost is not a factor."

Tips

DO NOT OPT FOR THE SELF CHECK IN!!

Just be patient and stand in line for a frickin change, other wise you may get stuck in a ""classic room""
We had a great room for the NYE celebration.
Service, housekeeping were very responsive
Slots are a little too high end....make the 5 minute walk to Bally's and give yourself a treat by playing real live KENO, before the nit-wits in marketing wipes it out too...
Another tip..... Vegas flu is for real.....everyone coughing or sneezing....bring wipes before playing slots...save yourself some true agony"
CE1XM5GaG3K0BDQScTS87w,1,"This place is slowly going downhill. Today it hit Rock bottom for me. Ordered a hotdog and a ice tea. 15 mins after order, and I saw 3 other orders go out in that 15 mins. I went and asked for the manager, he was dealing with a complete wrong order. Manager said st the time of Oder I should have been told there was a 10 delay on hotdogs. I was not. Wait I have already waited for 13 mins??? WTF ok go back and wait. 7 more mins, now 20 mins after I ordered my 1 hotdog, I go back to the cashier and ask for a refund. Cashier asks why? I tell him because I haven't gotten my food. He calls for the manager Tom for a refund. Tom says he will be right there. 5 mins later I left. No food. No refund. I did left the cashier know I will NEVER be back."

7sjC7BbA-VPBwecm1ECCdQ,4,"Gio Rana's is like a Really Really Nice East Side Mario's

That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I waffled back and forth on this place, unable to decide if it was worth three or four stars.  I settled on three and a half, and rounded down because it's Monday.  Notwithstanding the rating, I recommend you try it at least once.

After a weekend jam-packed with excitement, Thursday seems so long ago but I remember vividly the group of about 20 of us that gathered to say farewell to FARC and fellow meatatarian Deanna ""if it once ate, I'll eat it at least once"" W.  I arrived late but still had a little time to case the joint before getting a beer* in my hand and my order in.  Gio Rana's is built inside an old bank**, with high ceilings and an open-concept kitchen near the back of the large dining area.  It's not that exciting, save for the Really Really cool private wining and dining room that used to be the bank's vault.

The menu consisted of a sheet of white paper, printed double-sided, in a ratty plastic sheath.  Really Really cheap-looking.  Thankfully, selection was good, and everyone at the table seemed to be able to find something they wanted.  I found lots, and ended up settling on pan-seared scallops with pork belly and jus, pork tenderloin in a walnut and gorgonzola sauce and beet, tomato and goat cheese salad. (these, and two bottles of beer, set me back $60 including a respectable gratuity).

Scallops

My first bite gave me a bit of a foodgasm.  Two scallops, and a healthy dose of pork belly.  They were Really Really big, and perfectly cooked.  Regrettably, a bit of grit (not sure if that's a given with scallops, but I wish it weren't).  The pork belly was a nice nod at the more traditional bacon-wrapping, and the jus was a nice complement.

Pork Tenderloin

Really Really Nice Gorgonzola sauce.  Portion was quite large, and the pork was nicely done.  Found myself mopping up the sauce with whatever I could find around me.  Eventually just picked the plate up and licked it clean.

Beet Salad

Tasty, but unremarkable.  It was what it was and I'd probably try something else next time.  Also, got hit with a giant piece of onion near the end of it that left me with onion-mouth until I got a few pints of draught in me at our next stop.

Service:  

Our group of 20 was handled professionally from where I was sitting.  Deanna's co-FARC Christine ""charfcuterator"" C may beg to differ; sitting across from me the poor doll was elbowed and bumped for most of her time at the table.  Still, we were taken care of and we weren't kept waiting any longer than might be expected for such a large group.

Is Gio Rana's Really Like an East Side Mario's?  Really?

I kinda think so.  It's loud and chaotic, and the décor is equally kitschy.  The service is ""run around like a chicken with your head cut off"" style (but effective) and the place is good for large groups.  

While the food is absolutely delicious, I still feel like I'm getting hosed when I pay 60 bucks at a place that so desperately needs a makeover (or at least a nosejob) and has such horribly cheap-looking menus.

FrO1-AkjyREYo5gA0Tvpsg,4,"We really like this new trampoline park and it's different than the other ones we go to in the area.  Think ""ninja warrior meets Parkour"" in the activities.  It's more ""obstacle course"" focused with space to also bounce and do dodge ball - so the variety is impressive.  It also has a rockwall that the kids can just jump off into a foam pit and a basketball section.  The staff were really friendly and helpful - and played with my kids and showed them how to do stuff, which was really great.  It was heavily staffed, so I felt like the supervision and oversight were awesome and reassuring.
They have a small cafe and tons of sitting area for parents on a catwalk or down in the area between the door & the play area.  
They don't have the long ""running track"" style trampolines or any bounce houses - although there is a toddler area with a foam pit for smaller kids - but it's pretty small.
My only complaint is that it's a little pricey (both for bounce time and for cafe).  But overall, it's fun."

Q8C3DVkVC8MtKInjedBC2Q,3,"Not that healthy but very delicious. 

The menu consists mainly of two items: Burgers and milkshakes. The prices are reasonable and their set-up is great. You order first, then they seat you. 

Burgers come with a cute cookie and range from 4oz -6oz. However, this is plenty considering all the other stuff it comes with.  

Milkshakes are very creative. Most seem to be chocolate/vanilla based with something wacky on top. It's like getting two deserts."
K76_loa4E6W6uXT4HI0Wxg,5,"As a vegetarian there's always more limited options but their zucca ravioli was sooo good. I've been here twice, once the service was great, the other was definitely slow but I was with a group and we were in no rush that time so it didn't bother me all that much."

I had the samosas, eggless egg rolls, raspberry beret, and strawberry lemonade. It was all so flavorful and cooked just right. I was full and satisfied. 

The service was surprisingly fast considering it was lunch time. To be honest I was hoping I didn't have to wait because I'm 7 months pregnant and I can get hangry at times. Luckily it ended well for everyone. 

I will be back and I'm taking my mom next time."
NEunM1_jGE2Y96iVD4sveg,1,You get one star because I have to leave at least one.

They also ran out of plastic cutlery and I was told that our server would be bringing them to our table. Unfortunately the same lady at the cash brought us our food and failed to bring us cutlery. When I asked for it, she rudely told us ""to get it yourself""

tmVxT_x9CV7_jON7--pb5g,1,"I had arranged a birthday party for my son at this establishment. I had made the reservation a week and a half prior to the day of the party. I called the establishment an hour and a half before the time of the party to double check about a few details. The representative from Flip Dunk informed me that my party started at 4p, not 6p. Obviously I felt terrible that this happened to my son when he was so excited. However, Flip Dunk didn't share my disappointment. After waiting on hold for 10 minutes, the representative informed me that I would be able to receive passes to attend another day. So, I pulled it together and took all the kids to the movies to celebrate and informed all of the parents we would be returning to FD at a later date to jump. Did I say I prepaid nearly two hundred dollars? Or that I never received a courtesy conformation call from FD? Or that I was never sent the waiver for children's parents to sign who would be attending the party? So here I am, returning to FD to make up the mistake to my son and his friends. First thing they say is, does everyone have a waiver signed. I flip out, hehe!! but somehow every kid I brought had a waiver on file or their parent was still at FD to sign so their child could participate. Phew! I hadn't expressed my disappointment to the establishment until a child showed up about 30 minutes late. I was using one of the passes that was given to me and this lady (Mallory) steps in and says, is she your child? I said no. Then she said, ""these passes are for family members only"". I then told her, ""no, they are for my sons missed birthday party due to a miscommunication. And I also told her, ""no one confirmed with me about the details nor sent the waiver to be signed by every child's patent prior to the party"". Then Mallory said, ""we don't do that!"" I told her, yeah, because I prepaid, so why would you care about my sons birthday party? You already got your money, of course you don't care. So I told her, ""don't worry, we don't come back here!"""

YENiFtva0MKoyj51Br4FKA,4,"Came here last year during a work trip and had a very good experience. Arrived around 10ish after dinner on a Saturday night. The decor is very modern and white as you can see from the pictures. Most of the table seats were taken so we opted to go sit at bar which was fairly empty. Our bartender was extremely nice and helpful with recommendations. I ended up getting the Bourbon Punch and it was very good. In the next hour, the place all of sudden became packed. All the barstools were taken up as well as the standing area. Even though our bartender was extremely busy, she still found the time to chat with us."

They had a $3 off any deep dish - soooo good. I've also had the margarita pizza and their hoagies (the meatball and the turkey) too which are pretty tasty. The Molly's cheese sticks is actually like a small pizza - really tasty if you order it as an app you might be too full for your actual pizza.  Molly's never disappoints."
sdpeq8UrMxQ_KJ8voxachg,4,"How can I explain the concept of Loaded Pierogi?  Basically, imagine you're making nachos, with a variety of different toppings, but instead of chips, you've got a pierogi base (fried, boiled, or half and half).  This is NOT what I was expecting, but I'm not complaining!

2 things I liked: Damn, that Miss Piggy is GOOD.  The sauce is delicious and the combo of the pork, goat cheese and green onion is *praise hands emoji*.  It was the deliciousness of this dish that caused me to beg my boyfriend to return.  The Butter Chicken wasn't AS good, in my opinion, but I still polished them all off in one go.

They serve Polish vodka!  I lived in Poland for 3 years and being able to order a Zurbuwka apple juice (and that the bar even had apple juice!) was the highlight of my visit.

1 thing I didn't: maybe the toppings are to be the focus, but the pierogi themselves aren't anything to write home about.  I've tried both the fried and the boiled, expecting the fried to just be a little bit crispier than the boiled, but they're not like fried pierogi I've had elsewhere at Polish places.  

All in all, this place is tasty and well worth a visit!"

Each time we've gone out to this charming and very busy bistro the experience has been superb.  Our host Tina has welcomed us as if we've been friends for a very long time. I love that! And I'm looking forward to many more visits to Tina's place. 
Both times the staple of our dining experience has been the Wingless Buffalo Dip.  It's a tangy cheesy dip made with Franks Hot Buffalo Sauce.  It was to die for.  Both times.  The burger was great. I do recommend the Spinach Artichoke Dip.Also one of my favorites.  

 Awesome menu! I'm looking forward to many more dining experiences here at Maizie's


Yo! Tina! See you soon!"
0D_ehQhsSIssBNKDcdru0g,4,"So, after a very large meal at Monstah Lobstah, I felt like my sweet to savory ratio was a little off. I remembered that this place was in the area and I've been dying to try it, so we stopped in for a little dessert.

My fella and I decided to share a Rebel Crepe (Japanese crepe filled with banana, strawberry, nutella and an ice cream of our choice - butter pecan). We got our order and started sharing! Everyone has described the flavor of the crepe as a little like a fortune cookie, but I would say it tastes more like a soft version of a sugar cone. Either way, it was delightful and not overly sweet. Since I prefer my desserts a little on the less sweet side, I probably would prefer this treat without the ice cream, but it did add a bit of interesting flavor punch to this dessert. 

About halfway through sharing my fella decided he wanted his own dessert and ordered his next crepe with banana, strawberry and white chocolate. He loved this one even more. I wasn't able to finish my entire crepe, but so might be a great idea to share if you're not super super hungry. 

All in all, great little dessert spot. I'd come back if I'm in the area."

An employee, Jenny to be exact, was more than disrespectful to me. She told me I was not allowed into the building because I was under 18, which in fact was wrong because I am. I told her the circumstances, and she refused to allow me to come in. That was fine until she put her arms over my chest and pushed me back. This is not the customer service I pay for.

-3OrxTWurMbpI4b9W3-nwA,1,"At first glance, this Target looks really cool! Located in the Steelyard Commons, it has a unique architectural design and lots of spanning windows and doors in the front. However, I was quickly disappointed upon entering the store.

When you walk in, you see lots of bins filled with random odds and ends. It's such a mess and so unappealing that I wouldn't be surprised if some people just turn around and leave. Some areas are organized, but the majority of the store seems to have no order whatsoever. There is a nice Starbucks inside the store with a large seating area and windows, which would be a cool spot to hang out or take a break from shopping if the customer service wasn't so horrible there. The filthy bathroom at this Target is what really put me over the edge. Every single stall was trashed. Overflowing toilets, paper and garbage everywhere, flies buzzing around, just completely disgusting! I promptly left after encountering the bathroom situation.

Not one of the better Targets I've been to. I wouldn't recommend it if you are turned off by messy and disorganized stores. To be honest though, the entire Steelyard Commons Plaza and all of its stores seem to be declining in quality."

They even brought me a blanket because I was cold while I was waiting in the chair for the numbing to set in. The hardest part were a couple of shots in my mouth to numb the area. Then he came in and gave it a little push one way then the other way and he said that's it, you're done. In less that 45 seconds it was out and I didn't feel a thing as far as pain, just a little pressure and that was it! I was worried it wasn't numb enough but I was wrong. I asked to keep my tooth as a souvenir and he let me. Pretty crazy how deep, long and heavy your wisdom teeth are. Definitely recommending this office to my family and friends. Thank you Dr Moxley and staff! Victoria F"
3OvLspbAmZO15ZnT5n_4Mw,5,"THE BEST SUSHI SPECIAL ON THIS SIDE OF TOWN!!! sushi WA has half off sushi rolls Mon to sat 11-3 and its awesome. they don't jack up the price and tell you its half off, it really is like 3 bucks a roll. the place is very nice great decor great sake selection, great sushi, its traditional yet creative with out going overboard, like some places serving lasagna rolls YUK!!! try it its great especially for a sat lunch or business meetings"
juPSNQnER6gm9oLo6B_mag,2,"Whoever gave this place a 5 star rating was smokin' something strong!  The worst pizza I've ever eaten.  ""Sausage mystery chunks"" were gross, ordered roasted red peppers (but NOT), also couldn't find the onions I ordered, the 12"" thin crusted cardboard crust was tasteless and obviously will never return!  This was 1st and last Domino's for me."
0SbLJdHHP3g2XVAMTAgvzg,5,Amazing. Just amazing. This place is covered in authentic Spanish decor with plenty of space for sitting. The horseshoe shaped bar is perfect for a night to watch some sports. The Street Tacos would probably be the best tacos I have ever had. Of course with all of this greatness be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait. This place is always packed with hungry locals
3r30-Zr_-mC7u8TuYL95YA,4,"Okay 10/10 would recommend- this place is AHMAZZING! My boyfriend and I came here last night to grab dinner to go and we were taken by how delicious everything was. 

It was a Tuesday night and they were packed- every table was full which really speaks volumes. We walked in and ordered our food with the attendant at the front. We had the gyro meraki and the lamb burger with an order of the feta fries. I had the gyro with chicken and it was packed with flavor (the tzatziki sauce is everything)- and I really appreciated it being wrapped perfectly and easy to eat. The lamb burger was also just as great! The feta fries though omgggg I have no words! They were crispy and salted to perfection and didn't get soggy even with the melted feta. Absolutely delicious! Will definitely be back!"
2F9Kl7dG7LGBA21J-njoZg,2,"While I still love this place....things seem to be going downhill.
Food quality is not as good as it was in the past. On my last two visits, I've ordered the same dishes and on each occasion, the only thing consistent was the name. Quality was all over the place.
Service is odd. Your dishes do not come out at the same time...it comes out when the chef/cook feels like making them. On our last visit our green beans came out as we were finishing up our meals...to be honest, we thought they had forgotten about them. The time before, the noodle dish we ordered came out a good 10 minutes after the rest of our meal did. It's very odd and not a great way to serve food.
Some staff are great...some shouldn't be working there.
I still love their green beans (kan shue). Last time we ordered the chili chicken it was good, the time before it was dreadful.....lots of fatty pieces in it.
Its still my go to place for Hakka.....I live in Woodbridge and drive out for their food."
VBVOx4V5tG1CHGEtioPwGA,2,"Nothing offensive against older people however when I walked in and it looks like a nursing home scene I should have gotten a clue about the food. Bland, powdered mashed potatoes and gravy, undercooked - doughy dinner roll and canned gravy... I'll pass."

4dNuXgqBAuh2XzjEUocxMw,5,I  just love going here for the event. This time it was a rv show. The staff workibg the event for the stadium are so nice. I had a stroller with me and they took me to the elevator so I  didn't have to walk the ramp. Thank you to the stadium staff.
E6w0NpPYKBB7IM8upKHLUg,3,"Okay, let's be clear here. We're talking about a 24 hour breakfast restaurant that happens to sell other items cleverly disguised to be viable options at lunch and dinner.

If you're on your cell phone and you're looking for a plateful of food and just need to get your grub on then you've found your mecca. Any of the breakfast menu items found on one side of the paper placemat menu will do. All you have to decide is how much cholesterol you're in the mood for.

Servers are pretty quick here and when it's busy there's a reason for that - they want to get you in an out as quickly as possible.

The decor has all the charm of the lower deck on the Titanic. I always laugh at the barrier between booths that are side by side. This piece of wood that is elbow height can be removed to make the booths feel more like one unit. Someone put time and effort into this but it really doesn't improve any scenario when removed.

TO SUM IT UP: Come here and get breakfast any time of the day but don't be dissuaded of the book by its cover."
X-SvTVZy7xep3G0r_xG0tw,4,"Good sushi, a bit pricey but expected it to be since its in the heart of the downtown core. They have AYCE and bentos, and my friends and I opted for the bento box. It's spacious and it has an urban and classy aesthetic. Noise level is moderate, so you can carry good conversation there and the space is very inviting. Located on the 3rd floor of the AMC."
eoKU0enF1OdDVb6sjtIRXQ,5,"AHH-MAZING sandwiches!! Another win for the LGO brand. The crispy chicken Sammy was voted as a top chicken sandwich in AZ...it did not disappoint. The fish sandwich was actually the winner of the day. The tartar sauce was out of this world. Service was great, great patio, and some of the best restaurant music I have had in town! This will defiantly be a go to in the Arcadia area food meca."
f28xvywIj87s3IldHNzoeg,3,"Decent place to get Boba drinks on the Southwest part of Las Vegas.  This place fell short at customer service specifically with the ""impatient cashier"" who was taking our order at the time. As a customer are we not able to take our time and freely explore the options your menu has to offer? I felt that the cashier at the time was expecting us to just come in and automatically order so we wouldn't take up any of her time behind the register. The rest of the staff was great and their drinks made up for the unfortunate experience that we had."
iSs6Q6GE1KLQnYezdd_uqw,1,Never will I come here again!  Poor service and disorganized!   Waited 4 hours for a simple oil change.

54rI49rArssLFQYDfUTuAg,4,"I'll give it five stars for a couple of reasons. It's by no means the most gourmet place you'll ever go to, and it's not overly glitzy or glamorous.

That said, one of my best friends is a chef here, and he makes sure that we're taken care of with any special requests we might have when it comes to food. That also goes for the rest of the staff; the service is EXCELLENT and friendly (without bias), and they have a couple of cool little promotions going on.

Beers are like $2 a pop; every time you drink a fat tire, you get entered into a raffle for a fat tire bike. Besides, fat tire is delicious. 

The food is actually excellent as well. I've tried more than a few things here, and I've been surprised every time with how good the quality was for a restaurant that's off the beaten track, hence the name. 

There's bar shuffleboard, darts, pool tables. Video poker. Couches, comfy chairs, big screens for watching football/other sports.

Give this place a shot, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
ar-ZS0GLeWMsU2Fi6zhNrg,1,"do not use this company....they will rip you off!!!!!.  you do not get what you pay for and the drivers don't know how to work the stereo equipment.  horrible company, horrible customer service!!!!!!!!
it was supposed to be a memorable bachlorette party....but was very disappointing with the service and lack of amenities that we did not get but yet paid for.....
the owner james will not take responsibility and reimburse for this because he lacks customer service skills that are important for keeping a business alive!


As to the post below from Rachel, they were not early for pick up but on time......as everyone can relate listening to a radio sucks because of all the comercials and they don't always play great songs....and let's see....$25....oh wow, what a deal.  I paid $800 and they only want to offer $25.....and as for the $75 credit for a future reservation....well I don't live in the same state so how is that going to help?  I was just in town for the weekend!  

They did not try to work with me....they came up with that lame offer then didn't want to hear anything I had to say....then when I told them I was going to make a complaint online, they WITHDREW their offer.  Yeah that is great customer service!!!!!!!"
kt20nHxBTo6xkXwDTV6YyQ,3,I really like the salads here BUT ive been there on at least two occasions where ive seen two different employees (BOTH being the person in charge - which is why this is so disturbing) shake the salad dressing by placing BARE ungloved fingers over the dispenser of the salad dressing bottle! Then they touch the gross ipad register screen and do it again
3LNDRlQ6A7cNSsm8rfaGcA,5,I recently sold a lot of gear there and they gave me very fair prices and it was a great experience over all
ja4Jd_PmDP3TZkF58rjivQ,5,"The team and overall experience was incredible. Enjoyed our time horseback riding this past weekend.  We arrived for our 9 am appointment.  The weather was nice.  We had a party of 5 which included an 8-year-old.  I was concerned that he would be scared but literally, after the first 10 minutes, he was fine.  The ride is very calm and pretty simple.  Our leader/guide PAM was amazing.  She's very interactive and involved and just a great guide."
Yi641phEqoyx4rHGAhCU4A,4,"The Weekly has informative updates on mass transit, public schools, neighborhood crime, stories that apply to local residents, which I respect.  But what I really like is their two page spread of movie theaters and show times.  It's the quickest way to find what's ""now playing"" and where."
izZ8Ati12xNDIYdFB1Aekg,5,Onion Rings were fantastic.  Truffle French Fries were all right: the truffle flavor ended up on the serving dish but were not detectable on the fries.  We got Chandrelle Burger: the chandrelle mixture was overly sweet and I am not sure the mushrooms were even chandrelles.  The burger itself was the same as all the other fancy burger places serve.
2RHPei64VfrxQ9QaIib1OA,5,"So here is my thought. You have a beautiful October day , a fun family that likes to exercise together, a mom and dad that love the AZ desert  so Pinnacle Peak is a great place to put it all together for our family. Welcome to our Weekend Hike. 

I love the feel of a different ""type"" of  mountain to climb.My husband and I usually climb  Thunderbird Mountains  or Camelback. This was different with a  gravel path  instead of a large rocky path. The  hike is also unique that it is a turnaround versus a point to point hike. 

Watch out for the variety of people .The path is narrow and some people are unaware of the need to move over for faster climbers."

We absolutely picked the best complex!! Apartment work orders get fixed ASAP, the staff is friendly, the property is clean, pool is awesome, perfect Fitness Center & Aerobic Studio, and it's beautiful here. Monthly events like breakfast at the gate as you head out to work, pizza nights, gingerbread house making during Christmas time, etc. Location could not be more convenient. Just renewed for another year!!"

IXYLmBVvRVFJZEhnhE_YsQ,4,"I have been coming to NCS for almost two years. I had been going to a salon in the mall for about a year and I noticed that my hair was getting extremely dry. I used some products that they recommended but nothing seemed to help.
A friend recommended Sara D so I made an appointment with her hoping that she would be able to make some suggestions for my dry and damaged hair. She suggested one product and gave me tips for drying and styling that would help. Since that first visit, my hair has come along way. Sara always gives me suggestions for keeping my hair healthy and she'll recommend different products in the store but never pushes me to purchase a product. She always asks what my budget is and what I'm looking to have done so that I'm not disappointed with the outcome. I'd highly recommend Sara - or any of the other stylists."

I couldn't believe the difference, my heels are beautiful!  I also had her fill my pink and white acrylic nails and again she outshines the girl I've been seeing for years.

rnPIu2k2F8TC2i1iJRjLdQ,2,"If you need a cold beer and a cheeseburger while watching a game, this is surely your spot. Each time I've been in, I sat at the bar. Bartenders are all friendly and don't leave you waiting too long before filling up an empty beer glass. What I have noticed though is that nobody runs bar food. If you order something from the bar, make sure you check the time and ask for it every five minutes. Otherwise, the bartenders forget to check on your food. 

This last time, we waited nearly 30 minutes for food. Didn't think a whole lot of it since the place was a little busy. But our entrees were clearly sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Bottom buns on our burgers were super soggy, while the tops were dried to a crisp. Maybe you get quicker food service by sitting at a table. As for the bar though, I'll just stick to beer, not food."
ERQz4PBpj_98x-rWwEu6Kg,5,"Trusted this company to come 1st pack, then load, deliver, and unpack my entire house! They were lightning fast and so kind. As you imagine I wanted my hands all over my stuff but they got it all handled including my need to control every detail. They put everything where I asked ad had all the right tools for the job. 
I've moved what feels like a million times and this has by far been the best experience yet. I don't have any plans on going anywhere anytime soon which is a bit of a shame to not be able to give this company any more to do for me but referrals and this yelp review. If you are relocating let this company prove to you their expertise!"
_jYS1pzcGV_PXiYniLZV9Q,5,Best drunk food on campus hands down. I always take my visiting friends here after a night of drinking. Asian kitchen never fails to disappoint. They always want to go back for lunch or the next night if they don't finish all their leftovers!
Gpm4fSoOt-0qmd2HeTGV5w,5,Le service était vraiment très lent.J'ai resté 1 h20 minutes au best buy st-catherine pour faire une échange. Je vais être méchante mais le personnel ne parle pas bien français ni anglais(si tu es même pas capable de faire des phrases complètes en français dans une province francophone pourquoi tu travailles dans une commerce au détail)En plus d être lent comme des tortues. Je pense que c'est le pire service a la clientèle que j'ai jamais vu.
5MmW4AOKTFlUN-o_yvu4Eg,4,"I've been eating at this restaurant since 2008 and I LOVE their authentic, high-quality food. The building is nothing special and is definitely a hole in the wall, but it won't phase you when you're eating their amazing-ass food."
JSbL0UZxuhjSeUHRG1St5Q,4,"To cut to the chase - the drinks are excellent. I'm a cocktail/spirits geek. Rhumbar's menu had given me signs of hope, but still, I was withholding judgment. I got a Latin Manhattan, and my gf got a Zombie. Both were flavorful and complex with subtleties. Good enough for craft cocktail folks. 

The patio/garden area is visually pleasing, with comfy couches and stuffed chairs. The music is loud as a mofo, but that's standard for Vegas, I guess. The late-night crowd had some obvious tourists in it, but it was mostly Douche Vegas, y'know?

The host was friendly and fun, and our server was pleasant enough. A little slow but not horribly so."
vCRFmURamC75QmXuG3JmTA,1,The owner and the service is terrible! Shaking my head.after a terrible service they insist that you must give a tip.wow the nerve
jn79Osp4VfA3Kur6YeGfIw,5,"Attended Ghostbar from 11P-1A on a Saturday night. It's not the premier nightspot it was 14 years ago, and they know it. It's advertised as ""relax with friends before hitting the clubs"". 
That said, it's an ultra-lounge. VIP seating available, dance floor, live DJ and signature drinks. You don't have to worry about people bumping into you on the dance floor like you will on the hottest night clubs. 
The decor is mediocre. The light show is average, but there are some extinguisher blast effects and they hand out party favors (light tubes, bandannas, sunglasses) from time to time, not to mention the infamous cheeseburger cart (with free grub).
It's a casual, social, party like atmosphere. I get the feeling I'm with 150 of my closest friends more than a Vegas hot spot.
We attended free with our hotel key, but I can't imagine them denying you access if you asked really nicely at the front desk. 
I had a single drink from the bar. A long island. Service was speedy and polite, but nothing extravagant. 
Overall - fun, but not mind-blowing.

GBDC - Ghostbar Dayclub - attended Nov 1 2014 for Day of the Killer Costumes and Jan. 24 2015 for Toga Party.
Nov. 1 - The most insane, awesome, fun costume party I've ever been to! 5-stars for this one! Super-packed with tasteful competitive costumes and a friendly environment. DJ and MC were on point. Very well done! Cheeseburger cart - check.

Jan. 24 - My gf and I were 2 of 5 patrons that actually dressed in togas! AVN star, Farrah Abraham was the guest, but she didn't even dress in a toga. If the employees hadn't dressed, it would've been really dumb, but they all dressed out. 
There were gogo dancers and the SWAG guy making sure everyone was having a great time. Cheeseburger cart made another appearance. We had a great time, but wished more patrons had participated. Are we the only ones that know how to party right? 
Not nearly as crowded as the Nov. 1 event and then, it hit me. Unless they're offering cash prizes, the participation goes WAY down. Most ppl want something for nothing. We just want to have a great time!"
O6JyK-Av_KCkv16_7Bce6g,1,"Wow, what a waste of time this was.  I went in with an honest picture of a divorce and problems up front.  I asked to be pre-approved before I started looking at cars with the understanding that this just might not happen.  They were all friendly and respectful... to my friend who went with me.  He has a mechanics background.  They shook his hand three times.  I was the one buying the car and was never offered this common courtesy. I really try not to be that kind of woman, but... Then they tried to sell me a Mustang that was posted on their internet inventory as clean and ready to go.  It had been driven by the wife of one of the people who work there, with major dents on the roof, a rear bumper that had significant damage, an obvious oil leak, and a questionable CARFAX report.  

They wanted me to make a promise to buy it that they would clean it up and make it ready to go.  We asked that if we were approved for that car and it didn't work out, that the offer would be good for another car of that price.  They said yes. But they wanted me to sign that I would buy that car... hmmmm.  Couldn't test drive it and it had problems...  Well, they brought out the credit guy, who once again talked to my friend instead of me, and shook his hand twice, but not mine.  The numbers did not match what was advertised at all.  There was $1000 added on to the price, now making a car that had a Kelley Blue Book value of $3400 from $6700 to $7700.  They said the higher price was a loan fee.  I was sitting under the sign that said ""We use Kelley Blue Book values to price our cars"".  Obviously not the same blue book the rest of us use.

The moral of this story is, do your homework to know the value of your purchase before you buy from these guys... and ladies, you might want to bring a guy with you so you don't have to shake their hands either."
uQ1v2LDSBz8W-spsEPRjug,2,"Thought I'd give this location a try from the one I usually go to in Surprise but I have to say it's even worse.
Despite it being a little more spacious than the one in Surprise, the eating area wasn't well cleaned by staff with food on the tables and floor (-1)
The food in our orders looked as if it was tossed up in the air as it was all on one side of the bowl (-1)
The food contained numerous bits of burnt ingredients (-1)
The portion sizes was lacking in comparison to other locations and there was little of everything like rice, etc (-1)
Guess I'll have to look for another alternative location."

f4tVsl4gvOKwNfTAj6YkxA,4,"We continue our quest to visit every NFL stadium, and First Energy Stadium in Cleveland was stadium number four. I absolutely love the location of the stadium, right on the water in downtown Cleveland, close to many fabulous restaurants and other sporting venues. The stadium itself was also nice- though our seats were of course covered with snow (something we didn't plan well enough for I can say). We sat in one of the 500 sections near center field and had a great view, and got to chat with numerous season ticket holders. The fans at the stadium overall were great- sure we got jeered a bit- but we were visitors so I expect that on the road. The workers were all great- when I was looking for my commemorative pin and one location didn't have it- they pointed me right to the correct spot. Numerous stadium employees stopped and shook our hands- said welcome to Cleveland, and Go Browns- which I loved.

My only complaint was the TV screens- they were not in great shape and a bit small compared to other stadiums. However, I understand this is being fixed in the off season- so yeah for First Energy Stadium. Truly a great stadium with wonderful people."

Dry biscuits, no flavor, I had the chicken Benedict.
Chicken was nothing special.

J6Mv7-3MhGnJn2IakbCBFg,3,"Could have been 5 stars but NOT having a working elevator to the food court puts the icing on the cake. What's worse is that there wasn't a sign that said that there are other access for those with babies and strollers or wheelchairs. If there was one, I didn't see it because the elevator that supposedly takes you to the food court didn't indicate any other working elevators. So I had to carry my 4month child with the stroller along with my 4 year old standing next to me. If my 4 year old wasn't hungry, I would have left and gone somewhere else to eat. But I had to make it happen for her. I will only be back at this mall for the Lego store. I no longer care for anything else. Hanks fashion show mall for being so adequate and convenient for customers."
GoPjvmn-JHwLPFa2w-EKtQ,4,"Usually this place is overly hyped and overly expensive for what it is.

But can't say no to a good deal! Came one Tuesday when they have 60 cent wings and special prices on draft beers and lunch specials. 

One thing is make sure you can count.. Yeah made tht mistake when I said I wanted six buffalo wings (beware they're dry spiced, no sauce), six medium and six sweet and tangy BBQ. For some odd reason I thought that was 12 and then afterwards I realized it wasn't. Damn I felt like an idiot and now I know why i failed math four times in college. But anyway..

The spice and sauces are delicious. Can't say no to wings. But believe me they get you on the fries and ranch. For a tiny ranch it was 1.25. For that price I'd rather bring ranch in my purse! 

For four of us (18 wings each), a large fry, 2 drinks and 3 sides of ranch  it came to 58 bucks. Next time I think I""ll Try wing king especially since the service was so so. On the plus side a manager did come by and introduce himself which was refreshing"
y_nE-aNoGSQuH33IW25cMw,5,My friends brother recommended this place for a good sandwich or salad and it did not disappoint! I got the BLT and it was such a yummy sandwich! If I lived locally I would eat here every chance I got!
oaKGlCBY4hWv0h9C4NpoXg,4,"Finally, a Thai restaurant in the university area that serves sticky rice (alone)! Service was fast and great. We were each surprised with complimentary salad topped with delicious peanut sauce. We also ordered fresh summer rolls with shrimp, and came with two sauces: peanut and hoisin -- both delicious and great pairings. They have two types of papaya salad that you can choose from: Bangkok style (south region) or Isan style (north region). We didn't know we had options until after we had already ordered, which we were given the Bangkok style. But we had no regrets -- it was delicious! Our dishes (crispy chicken and cashew duck) were also delicious. Our dishes did not taste as oily as other Thai restaurants. 

Unfortunately, this location is cursed, as I have seen many restaurants open and close throughout the years. But I hope Moon River becomes successful as I will be a regular customer!"
wAMfPUYS5_CoWDkNrErHqg,4,Great little Italian diner perfect for an easy breakfast or a delicious burger. We got the burger (yes it's homemade) and the breakfast special. Cheap and delicious.

iIavu7A6vwJ58wmA3w4jVw,1,"This particular Smashburger is single-handedly ruining the image of this entire brand. The manager is so rude, and definitely shouldn't work in customer service. The quality of the food--compared to other Smashburgers--is inedible and poorly prepared. Just saw that they didn't pass their health inspection last month and I'm not in the least bit surprised.  I definitely won't be throwing any more money away at this establishment. Literally any other restaurant in Tempe Marketplace is an upgrade from the experience at this unsanitary burger joint. How do you ruin a burger that's usually so good?! There are some really inept people behind the wheel here. This place really went downhill fast."
dmsM3-SzFxO8nz7CvS6T1Q,1,"Asian Gourmet is not the best food.  Staff at the Toronto Western Hospital Asian Gourmet are certainly not the friendliest.  When asking for a single vegetable item, but kindly asking that they give me half of one vegetable and half of another, they selfishly want to charge me for 2 items.  And yet all vegetable items are the same price.  So why not half corn and half peas . . . so to speak.  I was very unimpressed when I asked the manager to give me a half and half dinner.  He shocked me when telling me, ""We don't do half and half.""  I certainly cancelled my order and haven't ordered there since.

I should also tell you all that the cook there goes outside the hospital and has his smoke.

Have also seen many trays at tables or beside garbage with Asian Gourmet food left on.  So that tells people that they didn't enjoy their dinner at this place.

Have also seen a staff playing with her hair and elastic while standing near the food.

The staff just don't realize they are being watched and especially in regards to sanitary reasons."

QcwLZAxZXBfBp88frDIVmA,5,"Let me start by saying that I am VERY picky. I have been spray tanning for years, but once I moved to Arizona and found Danielle (through all of her positive yelp reviews) I now am extremely happy.  Best spray tan I have ever had.  I now refuse to go anywhere else.  She is so sweet and makes you feel comfortable.  She is precise and makes sure that this will be your best spray tan ever.  She speaks with you about what color you are wanting to be, asks what event/ reason that you are tanning and then makes great suggestions.  The tan is so natural.  There are no lines or streaks.  No one will ever know that you have not been laying out in the sun for weeks on end to get the perfect all over glow."
YKxthfN7WtGpmC2iAfAexw,5,"Visited Toronto for work and this was a recommendation. It did not disappoint. We ordered the slaw because it is there most famous dish. We added the sashimi tuna. I really didn't understand the hype until I tried it! 19 ingredients, excellent presentation and the flavors are amazing.  We also had the chicken dish since it was the very item that won Chef Lee, Top Chef. It was excellent! Also don't miss the Sangria. Refreshing, 25 ingredients including a tropical fruit cocktail that is left to enjoy in your glass. Service was exceptional and patio was a great atmosphere. I would return and try more items that looked amazing as I watched them all delivered to other tables. Great place!"
QQEFwa6_beWInaMVB6c78Q,3,"Nice spot on Queen West, and I originally came in on a recommendation from a friend.  I've been here a few times since then just for their delicious bomboloni and would recommend these to anybody with a sweet tooth.

On my last visit I was snapping a photo of the bomboloni display and was told that photos were not allowed inside. Considering how many photos are up here on Yelp, I don't see the fuss. Perhaps it was my using a camera rather than a smartphone. The lady asked if the photos were meant to be put up on a blog, and I said no these were just travel photos. She didn't bother me after that, but it soured my experience."
0Sise678lyiwE7JDUpzePA,5,Seriously the best Mediterranean food! The ordering style is like chipotle but with so many more options. The hummus is made to perfection and the kabobs perfectly cooked. I highly recommend and have become a regular customer!
HHlFKxthLFwWUwJUF_KgjA,2,"The food and service provided by the morning shift and the evening shift are polar opposites. So opposite and so bad it's almost comical. I much prefer the morning shift, especially on Sunday mornings. Morning shifts, while at times very busy, at least have the decency to provide you with kind, personable, and prompt service. With that, you get great food worth the wait and reasonably priced. More options to choose from. 

On the other hand, evenings provide with with mediocre food with some of the worst carelessness and rudeness I have dealt with in terms of service. God forbid you should order dinner to go, and god forbid you could be served a beverage while you wait as calling in seems questionable due to rude and impatient tones on the phone. The server was noticeably  bothered by a subtle, and patient presence while waiting for an order. Her cookie was more important for her dumb mouth rather than a polite request for a beverage not once, but three times, let alone any hope for a shred of polite decency. I HATE feeling like tipping should even be considered at all just because someone gave you something someone else worked their ass off for. If you don't care and you don't try you should get nothing. 

So go in the mornings, it's better that way in all regards."
iV9paFi1WToOhVTvvFeULQ,3,Pricey but the ice cream good. The person there was nice and friendly. Not a sit down place. A good place to stop by and enjoy a cone.
YdrZUpsHUMv2l98dJTAmYw,5,"Very easy to find and very quick service! Other places told me they would have to send my jewelry out, or their jewelers don't work every day which was inconvenient for me. I called Fast-Fix and they were able to see me the same day, and my simple request was done in under 30 minutes. Great quality as well! I will return to them for any jewelry needs."
bdIG5KQiJqVVdJrJ3vfwIg,2,"I don't understand the love for this place.  It's okay, and great in a pinch, but mexican food should taste better.  Their steak lacks flavor as if it's cooked hours earlier and left in a steamer. If it's cooked to order I'm shocked by how little flavor it has.  Also I'm confused by this location.  I ordered a chorizo torta because the Filiberto's website says it contains chorizo, eggs, guacamole, lettuce & mayo.  Yet mine contained chorizo egg beans and cheese.  Do each of these places have their own menus?"
DDxjseHfUDrvGBUB1oK06Q,4,"I really like that Qdoba made the pick 2 menu...I always love a good quesadilla but I like their naked burrito too. Now I get to have both! I also like that the pick 2 options are smaller so it's a little bit better portion control vs a huge burrito. 
Qdoba is the same principle as other Mexican fast food such as Zaba's or  Chipolate.  Everything is made to order right in front of you.  Quick service.  Decent prices. Get the Qdoba Qcard when you go here.  You'll get a free meal after X-number of purchases. (I can't remember if they base it off of points or number of meals purchases...either way it's a good deal!)
The chips and queso and/or guacamole are always a good addition to a meal!
I used to go there when I lived in South Dakota.  I frequented it when I lived in Carson City.  And I still go to Qdoba in Las Vegas!"
4cJJYoVeqKHuyRuCFC4lxw,4,"Lovely, family style, unpretencious, always kind, good, real, to the heart, place. Hits the spot and does it well. In its genre and within its greek town simplicity, it is a nice gem."
Pmh3lEEnQtlnR-cUgeum1g,2,"The prices are unbeatable. I usually only go for a pedicure Wilson always takes care of me because he knows I work on my feet all day long. This time the girl was kind of new since I had never seen her before, she kind of rushed through my pedicure, I mean it was still ok but not the usual treatment I receive from there."
T5DEpg51h0V8aNhQtwuSKQ,4,The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because Kendall is one of the most amazing associates. She always handled my apartment issues right away. Kendall always has a smile on her face and made my living experience at Bermuda a pure joy! As far as I am concerned this company is lucky to have her. She seems to be the only staff member ever working and going over and beyond for her tenants.
_FnzKngGvL4upP_7UnsUVg,2,"Food was pretty good, but the service is very poor. Waiter took our order, someone  else brought food.We sat there with no refills on drinks, waiter didn't come back till we had finished meal."
UCnM1IOnRoKLgPMQ0w1gHQ,2,"A little disappointing overall.  We tried to book a reservation on the weekend, but this place is full.  On a weekday evening was much easier.  So it must be good.

The waiter was really nice, but maybe trying too hard.  There's waiters who you can tell are actually funny and having a good time, and others who sound like their first night on stage at a comedy club - complete bomb.

anyways, we ordered the new york steak, salmon, and veal.

everything was drenched in olive oil.  i'm sure it was a high quality evoo, but everything pretty much tasted the same - olive oil with tomatoes and capers.

the new york steak was by far the best dish.  A good cut of beef.

veal was okay, and the salmon with crispy skin would have been good had it not been of the overly sour tomato sauce and overabundance of capers (or whatever those were).

Maybe we just ordered the wrong items, but we not not impressed with Rao's at all in terms of food.  Being in Vegas and at Caesars, we knew what the price tag was going to be.  So ""value"" didn't even figure into the 2 star rating."
LYV6qh6--pfuwtBT0xCjdQ,4,"We came for a private party on the Saturday of the long weekend. It was stifling hot outside and the a/c was apparently on inside but everyone was very hot.
They did a sit down meal and were able to make all my courses vegan and gf. 
The service was friendly and prompt. We entered our license plate into a kiosk upon arrival and then we didn't have to pay on the wAy our. This was set up for the guests of the party and was very convenient.
The washrooms in the hallway were clean and there were several stalls. The parking was convenient and lots of spaces available."
dUd52RS4gUfw8I1WDwbZSg,1,"This place went totally downhill after the change of ownership. Every time I've ordered delivery, they've either not been able to find my address (and then just went back) or they totally screwed up my order. But the absolute worst was finding some sort of metal string in my curry. It's really a shame because it used to be one of my favorite places."
4ie4ypgzCUA9Y_UPlA8YHA,4,"I am a Chinese student, male and with really hard hair. Most barbershops cannot deal with my hair styles properly but this one did me a really good favor. Both two barbers are friendly and skillful, the one who served me is patient and willing to listen to my opinions. A $23 men hair cut is really a nice price here compared to other mid-level barbershops and this do include hair washing and phone charging. In all, it is a really nice experience for me."
1nJ9r-AMgeXSGumZWogmJQ,2,"Ordered delivery and was not impressed.  Very doughy, soggy and chewy, not crispy at all and too thick for my taste.  I had asked for well done but it was not well done, and asked for extra sauce but  there was not enough at all!  The pepperoni and sausage were tasty, but the mushrooms were rubbery and right from the can.  I will continue my search for a great pizza in the north boros, alas Mandy's pizza was not the one."
GgXYWkdta_jtzoFb_IIjaA,5,This place is outstanding.  The new management under Mr. George McGann has really changed this place around.  There restaurant is newly remodeled and a great place to eat.  There are lots of great food choices and we recommend this restaurant to all of our friends.
e0J0oG4yoKuzXmTiZOwXTQ,1,I got food poisoning from Sushi House. I got the $5.99 lunch special with a spicy tempura salmon and avocado sweet potato. Be careful with this place.
D0ZZpxuW46_mKqVIv_51aw,2,"Don't be fooled by the Instagram photos you see. It's not as fun as it seems. Yes, there are plenty of good looking people that go here that makes the club look ""exclusive"". All I saw were girls sitting down, drinking and looking pretty. This club is overhyped. Lost & Found is tiny and VERY crowded. It's hard to dance here. The biggest turn off for me was the music. They ONLY played hip hop, and I'm pretty sure I heard Drake 80% of the night. I don't have a problem with hip hop music or Drake, but at least play a variety of different songs! You're better off staying at home with friends listening to music on YouTube with some alcohol. Save your money. I wouldn't even go if it was free with bottle service."
cIXqf5oChKcYK25L38Yvuw,5,"Village Coffee is a genuine neighborhood coffee shop. We've been coming for over a year and it always satisfies us. Their coffee selections are flavorful, off the beaten path and served plenty hot! The pastries are the perfect accompaniment and if I weren't a semi obsessive calorie counter, I'd probably get one of each! Live music outside on weekends is a very nice touch too. Drop in, you'll leave smiling."
QjBHynP95MWcCKYktyPjaQ,5,"DMV (North Decatur / Las Vegas, NV)

This is probably the quickest and best DMV that I have ever been to. My last couple of visits have been so smooth and painless that I think this review deserves to be a rhyme.  

Here you go....

Roses are red,
violets are blue.
Who am I kidding?
Rhymes are tough. Schedule an appointment and you're in and out. Hmm...In-N-Out."
4EZ33JXGSg2LWXHW-e4EGw,5,"Just wanted to leave another review for this place.  I am never disappointed !    Such good food!!!!!! Tonight we had the bangers and mash, and fish and chips.   I am beyond happy!  So delicious !  Best happy hour and food in Vegas by far and I've lived here nearly 3 years."
_MjW2TQFq4dZNKBSvIo7eQ,5,I have been to this location a couple times and have always found really good deals on what I was looking for. This last time I actually sold some books and the process was so easy!!  I have found that the people that work there actually know about books and the authors!  Amazing!  Imagine that!  A bookstore where the people know about books!  How refreshing!  I'll be back!
aFpx8G-yP1f_Hz8GOdDAqw,4,"This place was almost perfect. My only complaint is waiting 30 minutes with lots of other people when they have closed a third of their seating area. Why do that when it's the middle of your busiest time? But the food was just so good, I'm giving them extra stars for that so that's why 4 stars. I will go back when I come back to Vegas"
4dnqux0TzgUBc6B_I9lH3g,4,"I feel bad for the people who work here because the lights flicker creepily every few minutes...spaced out just long enough to forget.  It really gives this place a haunted mansion vibe and think I would probably go insane if I had to spend more than 2 hours here. I am genuinely confused by the 1 foot tall shelf/floor space used to store vinegar, sriracha, and other sauces -seems kind of gross but maybe I'm just too picky??? The best part about this place was our waiter.  Imagine if Stinky from Hey Arnold grew up as a real human being and has the deepest voice ever. I'm talking about like whatever the opposite of a dog whistle is deep- the kind of low pitched sound that will make you crap your pants if you aren't careful.  Great service is the only reason this isn't a 1 star review. He was polite, attentive, and helped explain the difference between the ""holiday mule"" and ""apple pie mule"" (the holiday mule has a sugar rim).  I had an IPA that was pretty good."
G7O1K2NxAfQBAMOqJfzWZA,5,"most authentic bagels in phoenix. so good, the asiago bagels are made fresh every day and aren't too pricey."
WV5fD3Up-PV_1wDw0V1jcA,2,"Been looking for a nice local Italian restaurant and finally found one. Nice interior and quite, I could actually hear my dinner partner talk. The food was very good. The only complaint was the service, one gal was working away, but the guy who was suppose to bring us the check was way to slow. And the hostess could have helped out. 
Came back with my husband. I had the eggplant , burnt my mouth and the dish tasted of only cheese. My husband had a pasta dish that was supposed to be spicy but wasn't. Serve was still bad and this time the food was subpar. Won't come back."
pGEvxPCIdmaMT07GIjzNUA,1,"I can not speak to the quality of the beer/drinks but as far as the food goes this is a serious thumbs DOWN. My first time visiting I was encouraged to get fish tacos by the bartender and a colleague. Nope, not good. Who puts cheddar cheese on fish tacos? That should have been my first warning. The fried fish was way nasty. I'm not even sure I can describe the horror.Second trip just today and I got the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. Chicken was, dry,dry,dry!. Shoestring fries where not hot upon arrival. I went over lunch so it was a bit busy both times but come on. The water has a sanitize taste so maybe someone is going crazy on the sanitizer rinse. 1 star because the service was average. Third time will not be the charm. I'll pass on the next invitation to this place, that is for sure."
OSF1dqFZUCvkL0rodXXA-Q,5,"Today we took our 3 month old Lab/Shep in for a nail trim...she's very verbal and dramatic. The service was super fast and the fee was very reasonable. Needless to say, all future nail trims will be done at Groomingdales on Cheyenne."
A631E6DoyicW1LZaaHHPRA,4,"For my 30th birthday we decided to go to Las Vegas and wanted to eat at one of the strip's top restaurants.  After reading various reviews, we decided on CUT.  I would have to say that the decor and the food lived up to all the hype.  The decor is elegant, yet hip and the swivel chairs and mirrors everywhere give it a real fun vibe.

We started with the pork belly and Louis Shrimp and Crab cocktail.  They were both light and delicate with intense flavors.  I then had the 10 oz American Waygu (kobe) Strip Steak and my wife had the 21 day aged Filet.  The meat lived up to all of our expectations.  We both had trouble finishing after eating the starters but could not waste the delicious meat.  I would have to recommend splurging for the Waygu steaks or even the Japanese Kobe.  At $80 a steak, the Waygu is definitely worth a little more after trying both.  Don't get me wrong the filet was great, but hard to compare after eating the Strip.

The reason I can't give it a 5 is because we somehow managed to get the server that must have just got promoted from the ""B"" team.  We could tell the server to our right was top notch but our guy just lacked in so many ways.  He started off by taking our drink order and seriously not bringing it back for ten minutes (place was not slammed).  The table next to us was sat after us and had drinks and bread at least 5 minutes before us.  The sommelier  ended up having to go to the bar to get them for us.  It doesn't seem to hard to pour McCallan 15 yr in a glass but I digress.   Then our guy left the meat stand they put next to the table to show the different Cut's off at our table for 15 minutes until I had to ask someone to get it out of there.  We asked for recommendations and they were lame.  This website did a better job.  My wife asked what temp he recc'd her filet be cooked at and he said ""Med"".  Where are we?  And then he recommended steak sauces with these fine pieces of meat.  

For the price of the bill, this guy should have been much, much better.  The food was amazing and we had a great night, but I will probably try a few other steakhouses in LV before I venture back."
LPQrJDzUYLNpF0lAMUyaQA,4,"Delicious Bügels but terribly overpriced for the sandwiches. I would recommend buying half a dozen or a dozen bringing it home and buying your own cream cheese. Aside from that, best bagels outside of Montreal and NY... maybe even better in my opinion. 

Texture: dense, chewy, while toasted exterior stays crisp and pleasant

Taste: dough is yeasty, fragrant, sweet with subtle notes of whatever ever flavor you pick.

Appearance: Uneven and not nearly close to being round, definitely looks rustic and homemade."
tRhqhdECKJAaoWwMD0_klQ,1,We really tried to give this place plenty of time to work out all the kinks. First time there and so disappointed. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and Jr ordered the Fried Chicken plate. Both of our plates were barely luke warm. My waffle was burnt and so dry I could hardly get it down and his fried chicken was so dry it looked like the turkey off of National Lampoo's Christmas Vacation. Plus our server never even refilled our water after all the dry food. That was definitely a one and done!
dxn5_bwQATraOz5pOafRag,4,"I give it four stars for the food.  Service is very poor, to say the least, but worth putting up with just to eat the food. 

Again, I agree with my friend, Clint. 

My wife has done crab legs and crab; I've done the Crawfish. We've both done the Shrimp. 

My suggestion; stay with the shrimp. Order it to your spice level of comfort. 

I like the Cajun Fries, my wife likes the Sweet Potato Fries. 

Go early, or you will have a tough time finding parking and be greeted with a long wait. 

It is pricey, but a great eating experience. We have taken my wife's relatives and friends from Korea to this place, and they always want to come back and make it their last meal before they return to home. 

Not a great place for a first date, but great for someone you're very comfortable with, who isn't into trendiness and snobby atmospheres."
yltVG33C2a1L1IH0FIWUTA,4,"I heard a lot of mixed reviews from friends and from yelp but went to check it out last week and had an great time! 
We showed up at 7 on a Saturday, so we expected a wait, but we found a seat at the huge indoor/outdoor bar and had a few drinks while we waited.
We loved the atmosphere and long tables & bench seating, other people were eating outside too. A band started playing at 9; the servers were very relaxed and casual but had great menu knowledge!! (which I always a good sign)
SIDEBAR: they have a waiter who looks like a cross between Ricky Martin and The Situation.
of COURSE we tried the pretzel fondue. Awesome. As well as the olives appetizer. I had the ahi tuna salad which was large and filling and my boyfriend had the ribs which he oogled they were better than Banderas haha.
All in all, great time, will return!!"

There is basically 3 or 4 restaurants in one space! I was less impressed with my food though. I'd like to try the other eateries in the orchard.

The staff that greeted us and served our drinks were super friendly. A bit pricey though for a small iced london fog.. again mostly ice. but at this point its business and how most coffee places serve iced drinks. overall pretty good. Not enough places to sit tho.. so we ordered to go. Def would come back."

Located in the Gold Coast, the restaurant is open-aired... with no windows and a view of the casino. We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated and then the fun began! Loaded carts of Dim Sum treats continually circle the restaurant awaiting your waive to procure more. The dumplings were outstanding with a selection of several meats and styles from rice flour to a flaky pastry crust. The cucumber salad was very good and spiced well. Our favorite was the delicate noodle dumpling filled with spiced pork. Best to brush up on your dim sum knowledge as many of the servers do not speak alot of English... just enough to let you know the main ingredient! And... each selection is about $2.50 to $5, leaving us with a very reasonable check!"

LuixYWVJbZygY_Ig0IZlkA,1,"BE WARNED!! My party and I were assaulted by random California natives(according to their license plates), yet we were all somehow also attacked by the Security with tasers and mace. My girlfriend was on the ground, mounted by an overweight woman, and I was on top a man that decided to sucker punch me for trying to calm down the situation. Artisan Security and the Metopolitan are a joke. You're better off beating the shit out of the trouble makers because Security is useless and Metro is too occupied with their Hookers to give a shit about people who actually need valid assistance (especially to the African American officer who was extremely inconsiderate and rude). Thanks to them, we were attacked by crazy people, FOR NO REASON, and they ran away like the cowards they were. Fuck the system!!!"
XFV4R6VeHzcW4JQXZNcYcA,3,"Good but does not live up to the hipe. 

When I go to a BBQ like this I expect to be blown away but the couple times I have gone, just haven't done it for me. Food is average, and portion sizes are on the small size. If I am picking the restaurant for lunch or dinner, I will not be picking Bubba's Q. 

Not a bad place to go but keep you expectations in check."
LsEh7rsaQVTlW3i5vLoeDw,4,"If you want a chai latte that is 95% steamed milk and with a side of surly barista, this is the place to be. Not sure why I tried again"
FLlyIOqcPFTsbWddZ3WNbQ,3,"Meh. Long wait, unfriendly staff, and the food just isn't that great. It's not bad, but it's the kind of stuff that you could throw together in 15 minutes and probably be a lot better. Out of the 3 people that ordered over easy or poached eggs at my table, all the yolks were cooked all the way through."
YPkV8xdBdabX3Bb8QzbwZw,4,Everyone at Queen Creek Smiles is pleasant and caring. The dentists are very knowledgeable and gentle. I actually look forward to going to the dentist because I know I am in good hands. They have educated me on the importance of good dental hygiene for overall health and since going here I feel better than ever.  The office staff is organized and efficient along with the hygienist who is great. I would give them more stars if I could!
JOuPnkZ-EUQvoGZffisF_A,5,This stay was a wonderful experience! We wish that we had more time. The staff were friendly and inviting. The room was clean with an amazing view and the cleanliness was impeccable. It was our anniversary so the hotel staff had champagne and strawberries waiting in the room with a sweet heartfelt note. We will be back and highly recommend anyone to stay at the Mandarin. Thank you for our amazing experience at your hotel! The staff is wonderful and attentive. I can't say enough kind words about this little slice of paradise.

Although the market looks great on the inside....there wasn't much to draw you in for long periods of time inside.  A quick breeze through the doors and we were done."

uCR37dprt08XOMWrWYxmiw,3,"This Denny's is very convenient to the Monte Carlo and the MGM Grand Hotels.  It is open 24 hours and has no big problems.  Sometimes the wait is long, so get there early.  The music is often too LOUD.  The waiters are friendly and as efficient as feasible in light of their work load.  Its food is ok, but it is not a fine dining experience, of course.  
I have eaten there many times and expect to do so again on my next visit to Las Vegas."
JOHqnkljv4HwUXwMie20Hg,4,Yeah these guys were pretty good. Didn't have too much of an idea for what i wanted but they helped me figure it out. Very satisfied with my haircut. The hot towel and neck shave at the end was a nice touch as well. Only complaint is definitely price.  $21 for my cut I had longish hair. Will definitely be coming back here next time I visit

sMWcrA3P8JGQbz_qdPfuEA,4,"I wish I could give this place a better rating but I just felt so much anxiety eating breakfast. They shoved WAY too many people into this restaurant. Barely any space to walk or breathe or have a decent conversation. The music was blasting so loud I didn't want to talk because it was exhausting to have to yell and scream at 10am when I'm just trying to get some breakfast in. I mean I know it's Vegas but still.

They also don't have a restroom inside, you have to walk back downstairs to the casino to even wash your hands :(

The service was forgettable. Nothing special but not terrible. 

Enough negativity though, the food was still great and my pancake was about double the size of my face! Tasted great, everything tasted awesome. You're definitely getting what you paid for! That's for sure! Which is why I wish I could give them a better rating but I'm just not happy with the environment! If you're okay with craziness that early in the morning, you'll fit in just fine!"
srcencSsJcp-9wlFy8lpyw,4,"Some fun cocktails including a cold brew old fashioned.  Food is above average bar type stuff.  

There was a hair in my friends burger which was a bit awful but the management was friendly enough and comp'd her burger.  She went to the restroom to clean her hands and there wasn't any soap.  She mentioned it to one of the staff and got shrugged off.  My food didn't have a hair and the men's had soap.  Winning!"
sMQ9PvVxhjOAyPMyz8V6fg,3,"Went here after work with two co-workers. We wanted to go out for one of our co-workers belated birthday. It was a Saturday night and it was HELLA busy. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, but surprisingly my co-worker found a table by the bar and we waited for 2 minutes.

The food here is alright. I had the calamari and it was cooked perfectly. Two dips came with it and it was alright. One co-worker had chicken parmesan and a side of poutine (looked like she enjoyed it because she had no complaints) and my other co-worker had a veggie burger and she was pleasantly pleased with her meal. 

The only downfall was the dessert options.. or lack there of. We were so excited for dessert and it was just a disappointment. I just wish that they had more options when it came to dessert. Sucks. Oh well.

Overall, service was good. Our waitress was really friendly and polite. Just really loud - don't plan on going here for your first date... although, if you happen to come here on your first date and he/she is boring... you can watch interesting shows via the t.v's by the bar."
jfR6bQjEyiU106inxcKuJg,5,"Amazing! We get a pound of honey BBQ pork every time, and sometimes half a duck, to go. The men who work there are super friendly! We're never disappointed. Best BBQ pork in town, I'd say."
ME0cuQSWLei5WF43OGJMzg,4,"This park has lots of grassy areas and an exercise trail, as well as an unshaded playground on sand. My toddler & I were here for the playground on a weekday afternoon before swim class, & she had a lot of fun playing on 5 different slides and rocking animals. There are lots of monkey bars and climbing equipment for older kids. There are swings, small-kid swings, and a tire swing. All the equipment is a little sun-worn, but nothing was broken. The park grounds seemed well-maintained. 

Nice enough park, if you're in between appointments & the kids have energy to burn - especially in the non-summer months."
kLVsTR5QJDBvZj-vAwS8jQ,1,Small and unclean airport. Not many shops or restaurants to choose from to kill time before your flight. Given that it is a small airport it's expected. I saw on a map that they had a kids play area and it's literally just a small slide and 2-3 big foam blocks. Not  impressive but enough for a small child to be excited. My biggest complaint about this airport is the poor wifi connection and that the water from the fountain is DISGUSTING. Make sure you have bottled water with you!
yyWGFzSp--9PE_5japf4IQ,4,"from the service to the food to the experience!! Went with a few co-workers for an after work dinner and had a good conversation time!

Our server was very helpful and personable but not pushy or too comfortable. He gave us suggestions and opinions to help us make our plate selections. 

We decided to do it family style to try a few plates..get the 30 hour pork belly!! We all shared and left feeling full and didn't break the bank!! 

Best of all..the experience. The ambiance was very comfortable and relaxing. There was a couple sitting next to us and it felt very perfect for them..a ""date night"" restaurant. The lights were dim and subtle and the music in the back round was of all genres but of a soothing and loving tune. 

I so suggest giving Moko a try!!"
RvBOue_hFSnUoDNDpX8P_Q,5,"My toddlers and I love Dr. Barber. He's the best! Same day/next day appointments always available. Waiting room time is usually less than 10 minutes and he's super fun for the kids to interact with. They love how he wears cool ties. I appreciate the security presence as well. Friendly/professional staff assisting with whatever needs or questions I might have at the moment, especially being that I'm forever juggling a million and one things! Haven't had a bad experience yet."
i00rII-KrhqaGQx2VH7-WA,3,"I've been coming to this location since I was young, and still occasionally grab a bite to eat there when I'm seeing a movie in the area. I think that most of my good will towards this place is from nostalgia--after all, this place used to have barrels of peanuts and even an arcade, what else could a kid ask for? It used to be great; it used to revel in its own tackiness. A few years ago, they attempted to class the place up a little and the prices skyrocketed.

The food has never been top-notch, and yes, it's pricy, but it's decent if you're hungy enough. All in all, just a perfectly average place with perfectly average food, and uncharacteristically nice waiters and waitresses."
5jC5Rjjmaj19zDvByfJxpQ,3,"Pretty decent food and very friendly service.
The waitor seems overwhelmed though serving too many tables."
5T6KVY7-dsgMYTP13JJZDQ,4,"I've ordered take out a few times and it's always top notch. I've had the ribs, pulled pork sandwich, southern fried chicken, baked beans, sweet potato fries, garlic mashed potatoes, cornbread, and carrot cake. Everything is delicious. Nothing is overly sauced and the chicken is lightly breaded & very tasty. Southwestern PA is no Carolina, Tennessee, or Texas when it comes to barbecue, but Hog fathers does well for itself. 
The only complaint I could make is concerning the service. The people are friendly and helpful, but there seems to be a lack of coordination and structure. My food was ready and waiting for me the last time I picked up takeout (today), but I still spent more than 5-7 minutes inside the restaurant as the first person in line at the counter. That aside, it's really nice that they bring the food around to the outside of the counter, rather than handing it to you from behind it. 
Unless you have a ""bbq-guy"", give this place a try."
tPBvL6GX70OLKVEStwbBuA,5,"I have been taking been taking all 3 of our pups to Scottsdale Vet Clinic for over 5 years. Our primary Veterinarian is Dr. Lockhart, he is kind and very good with our dogs. I trust him %100 with his advice and choices to help benefit the health and wellbeing of our dogs. 

Since we absolutely love our vet clinic we also chose to use their grooming services for our dogs. I highly recommend Chris for grooming services. She is great with handling our dogs, even great with our stubborn snotty chihuahua who absolutely loves Chris. Chris even gives her beautifully painted nails. We have never had a bad experience with her and our dogs. I always recommend her to people when they are seeking out a groomer. 

The only negative I can say about the place is the front desk doesn't always have the best customer service. If it wasn't for the amazing vet techs, Dr.'s, and grooming I would probably walk out with a less than amazing experience with the way the front desk handles situations. Their communication is subpar considering the rest of the Clinic is amazing."
GPP-k10Z0NZqqX1xglkJAw,5,My favorite sushi place in the city! Great staff and awesome prices. They recently expanded the restaurant for more seating. For the amount of food and quality you can't beat the price.
W1VAuCqrAWRZxAwYFgBuDg,4,The place is very contemporary and has a nice atmosphere inside. The drinks look great but we didn't have any. We tried the pork buns and they were delicious and fresh. The dumplings were uninspired and probably made from a frozen premade batch. The miso ramen was very good but the pork ramen was a bit too salty. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth a trip.

I love the Butterfish 5/5 quite possibly the best entree on the menu.  Other stand outs include the Blackened Ahi and the Scallops."
SQigh461SnaX9QmplQfovw,4,"The place is kind of hidden. When you walk in you are asked to take off your shoes and wear disposable plastic shoe covers. The place is neat and well maintained. I got a shampoo and cut here. It was very quick and hassle free. They give you a good scalp massage during the shampoo. The staff is very nice and they deliver exactly what you ask for. I spent $60 for the service and bought a dry shampoo for $22. Don't be fooled by the free shampoo ad on Yelp, they don't accept it here. You also have to pay for parking!"

Had the chicken wings, tater tots.  excellent.  Everybodys food was good.  
Great place to go for fun. 
Will be back"
X8V2Egx4Hu__pGE9mdWlLg,4,"I am a Gold Rewards member at Marriot, and this one falls a great deal short.
1-Had a toilet that would refill itself every 10 minutes or so and be very noisy in doing so like if some one had flushed the toilet kept me up all nite, (thats why I am writing this at about midnight ).
2-the TV will not power on.
3-I can feel the springs in my bed.
4-Why is the wallpaper at this place so funky and out of time?

This place seems like it used to be some other type of hotel definitely not a Marriot.but was renovated.

Now Ambyr at the front desk was cool and professional. 

I am glad I am only here 2 nights."
tZDsbggFy_A1buFzsGIUVw,1,"DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!!!


I've lived in various apartment communities and this place is one of the worst I've yet to experience. The front office is bad at best. They're slow to fix complaints and maintenance, while also being unnecessarily condescending and rude in the process. Most of our dealings have been with Todd, and he is borderline incompetent. He seems to know the rudiments of the job, and that's about it. I am actually shocked at the 4 star rating overall, because I can't imagine someone giving this place above a 3 star.

On a more positive note, the location is really wonderful, but it's just infuriating dealing with a front office that doesn't even know you live there. Also, they start a hundred different projects and then don't finish any of them for months. This causes inconvenience like something I've never experienced before. They seem to be building a moat around our apartment building, and we're trying to turn the entire front half of the complex into an old western town with true dirt roads. But I don't think that's their goal. Through and through it just seems like one of the worst managed apartment complexes I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. DO NOT MOVE HERE. THEY ARE AWFUL."
z4C_SAyqy6yyNN_e5Simxg,4,"What a lovely and romantic date night restaurant. The restaurant is small but decorated with an eye to detail and while there are several tables in a small space they are laid out so that I did not feel encroached on. They have an exclusive table for two on a second level that privately overlooks the restaurant. I definitely want to sit there next time! 

Since this was date night we ordered a bottle of wine from their extensive list. Our friendly waitress presented the wine for a sample for us to confirm and made sure to keep our glasses full during the meal. 

To start I ordered the garlic shrimp which came in a little bowl in a broth which was a surprise but delicious. The boyfriend ordered the clam chowder which was the best clam chowder I have had since San Francisco. I ordered the filet medallions medium, but they came out medium well but were still delicious. I also enjoyed the blue cheese mashed potatoes.

The star of the night was the braised curry lamb shank. I am not usually a fan of lamb but this dish was phenomenal. It was so tender it was falling off of the bone and the curry sauce was light and fragrant. I don't believe I have ever had a steak in front of me and ever envied anyone else's dish - especially not a lamb dish! Unfortunately this wonder is not on the regular menu. 

While I would love to give them a 5 star rating my steak was overcooked and our favorite dish of the night is only available twice a year during restaurant week. I do have my eye on the curried grouper and can hopefully bump the rating up after a meal off of their regular menu."
xzkRbYGVb-WmJ8jwBZoKag,4,"Used my @BoldBajaFresh @Groupon for lunch today.

I've always been a fan a Baja Fresh, and ate there quite often in CA.

The distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.

I don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.

The chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me.
Rather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.

They came out hot and fresh, and delicious!

It was a nice display of customer service, an increasingly rare trait these days.

Thanks!"
jgxVs_-ahjcCWnK9GYAjeQ,1,If you are just a visitor (not for an event) maybe don't bother. We got charged $10 Cad just for parking only to find out that it was an additional $27 Cad to walk the grounds. We opted to take picks from the parking lot since we all ready paid....ugh. Could have parked out on the street. Feeling like we got hosed Casa Loma just so you know.
giA6Hn5WB6Nhm9zMS3JD-Q,4,"if you're from the bay area, raku is to sumika and ichiza is to sumiya (roughly).  that said, raku has some creative things that work such as kobe liver served raw.  sounds kinda dangerous but it works and it's uniquely good.  trying something new has its rewards, and this is one of them.  best dish of the night would be the sashimi salad; greens and sashimi go well with not just the dressing but the crunchy bits adding texture. just excellent.  skip the grilled kobe cuz kobe that's grilled just gives it too much heat, u want it a little medium rare and u really cant get that if it's grilled.  get the brown sugar pudding for dessert, just excellente.  dessert is topped with some froth from the milk; first taste is the milk then you taste the brown sugar and coffee flavor later in the bite.  2 different tastes in one, wow."
y-m-zSics1Xl_u9I2xrqzw,4,"The food was good and the only reason I'm even making a review is because of the great customer service. I sat down and they actually asked me how I was doing and if my food was taking long to come out, and the same crew member even checked up on it after that. On top of that I tried getting some ketchup and a worker offered to get it for me. All in all pretty impressed by their customer service considered it's fast food and you're usually on your own once your food comes out."
bPxi3sflqd2YS830sSdfgw,4,"GREAT breakfast! Minus the eggshell on one day and the champagne aluminum the other day. Those are minor imperfections compared to the bartenders, waiters and gift shop staff. Everyone was super nice, hostesses can use a little pep when greeting but once you are inside, you totally forget they were even a part of seating you."
d70BevWjD3ZprgHo_i4fJw,5,"Very nice facility! The staff is very helpful and they have a wide selection of weapons to choose from. If you're a local, check their website for their daily local specials. I went on a Wednesday and got 50% off lane rental."
-okD5kVThouNTvoacihHew,5,This place is incredible. I had been growing out my eye brows for a wedding and happen to find this place on yelp. Momita (hope the spelling is right) did an amazing job. Would highly recommend her to everyone. The location is easily accessible and the salon is very clean.
SfbkeQr0Hd5JxPmOeqNWug,3,"The one good thing this place has going for it is the beds - super comfy, made it hard to get up from a nap and go out!  Oh, and the rock memorabilia was very cool as well. The room could have been cleaner.  Everything was really dusty, including the items on the snack tray.  We arrived just after 8am on Saturday morning of Fourth of July weekend, and we were pleasantly surprised to get a room right away.  However, the staff wasn't particularly friendly.  Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.  So we wandered to the ""family pool"" where we could occupy lounge chairs without a food/drink minimum.  It was frustrating that they don't allow any outside food or drinks, not even water or gum!  So when we went to the bar to get a beer we would get a cup of ice too, and either let it melt down or fill it at the water fountain near the bathrooms.  Since we weren't staying Sunday night, we weren't given free admission to Rehab on Sunday, which was fine because we didn't really think that would be our scene anyway. 

I'll miss their beds next time I'm in Vegas, but I probably won't stay here again."
HxMOyMw3T1BBwF9eAtiC6A,5,"Wow, amazing restaurant! Picked this spot last minute because we missed our reservation somewhere else & since we r from hawaii there are NO bazilian restaurants on the island so we stop here. Im so getting tired of buffets because somtimes the quality of the foods arent there so little hesitant of eating all you can eat style but Im glad we did. We had the All you can eat meat & salad bar. Alejando was a fast, helpful waiter. he checked on us constantly even w/all the tables he was serving. He told us what the specials were w/o us asking & wasnt 2 pushy about it. he was funny 2.  the only thing I didnt like was the picture girls at the end. She told us ""taking pictures are free, I promise"" so we take the pictures & then she comes back w/a postcard size picture & says ""this is free"" mind you the picture on the card is smaller size than a id photo. then she goes but if you want ""these they r 2/30."" which were larger ones.  so all i have 2 say is they should be upfront about the pictures they take cause it wastes peoples time & while they enjoying their meal."
lrhkLu_3GiOarVWXJ6pBbw,4,It's great to find a brewery that has a diverse offering of both predictable and unpredictable brews. It's especially nice to find a place with great brews AND some food options that are somewhat healthy. The Ahi salad was generous and tasty.
5zrGp2wStMxTxItw16YSWg,5,"A really really good experience here at Wilbur. Friendly staff greeting everyone once they enter, decent prices. 

The salsas absolutely stole the show. The chips and guac for $4.50 is a relative steal in Toronto, and was tangy and flavourful. 

I tried three different options at the salsa bar and came away impressed with all of them. 

The Baja fish tacos were soft and flavourful, as was the chicken tinga. 

Decor and vibe are on point. 

Will be back."
nFpbW-weFTDd1DpO8Pu8Vw,5,"Service: Had the perfect waiter. He knew the menu. Never had repeat orders or special requests. Was quick, got orders right. Our group was big too.

Food: Special on ribs. Had whole rack, two sides (got soup for one without upcharge and clam chowder was best in town, large clams, no sand grit, perfect consistency), salad (got wedge), and pizoutti desert all for $18.95 at lunch. 

Ambiance: No complaints.

Five stars, first ever visit."
8PBRs0EMYlkI2UDFPvsC-Q,4,"My girlfriends and I had dinner at Mundo and it was great - almost perfect. We all had their Cadillac margaritas, which was good not spectacular - but we were all in the mood to have a few drinks. Had mojito, sangria, and one other drink that I can't remember now. Their drinks are strong and hit the spot.

We had chips and guacamole, tuna tostada, chopped salad for appetizer, then sea bass, filet mignon, shrimp diablo, and skirt steak as entrees with sides of mexican risotto, wild mushrooms, and spinach with jalepeno.

Of course they have to have great guacamole -- it's a standard for Mexican! No?

The Tuna tostada was interesting... it's a tortilla triangle with a thin layer of tuna with some type of sweet glaze. i liked it a lot, but the rest of the table was just OK about it. We all thought the chopped salad was delicious - lots of little chunky veggies and seasoned so it was a tad on the sweet side but enough acid to balance. I'd eat just that for lunch.

Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I think the sea bass was the best. It was steamed in parchment, and was the most moist and flavorful fish I've had in a while. Next time I go back for dinner, I'm going to order sea bass. Both of the steaks were good but it's steak - nothing special in my opinion. My shrimp diablo was good, just a tad salty but great flavors - a little spicy but tasty. I only at two shrimp -- it came with six -- because I was too full by then. The bed of mexican herbal rice that came with my shrimp was really really good. The sides especially the wild mushrooms are a must. The risotto was OK along with the spinach.

Usually, I go for lunch, and it was the first time for dinner, and it was great. The only uncomfortable thing about the meal was at the end, our waiter come to tell us that we only left him $36 in tip which was 15% (I don't tip on the tax) -- which I thought was a bit rude for a waiter to come and tell you that you had only tipped 15%. We all sort of looked at each other and said, OK... we'll discuss it. We left him a few more bucks...but honestly, it sort of ended a great evening with an odd feeling for the restaurant."
t06ACWkCrIEjxTlBXr-2aQ,2,Well I rated this business a 2 because they wouldn't talk to me face to face over security deposit issues after I moved out. Now  changing it to a 1 because it's been 3 months now. I'm still trying to get back my security deposit. After receiving an itemized invoice and questioning paint carpet and blinds charges. They wouldn't respond to a letter that explained the situation and items in concern. Even after stating in the invoice if there were any questions or concerns please give them a call.  Looks like we just might have to go to small claims court. Don't waste your time with this company unless you want them to try and steal your security deposit.
lVk3j23WeTOUYGTAbLKs6w,4,"Full disclosure - I have never eaten here.  But if you want to come for a good old fashioned cocktail lounge, then this is hard to beat.  Hasn't changed in 20+ years since I was last here except the old TV's are now flat screens.  The TV's are located above the bubbling water fire pit (yep, still there after all this time) but small enough to be private screens showing old music video clips.  Think MTV before it become a TV Channel.  Sorry about the lack of 5th star but they really do need to know how to make an espresso martini and not try and fudge it.  Other than that a great late night stop off for after dinner drinks."
BgV3B_7tMEUokOOOBbSmlA,1,"I was not impressed. Flat out. I really don't have a lot to elaborate on this place... they've really got to step up their food selection! Had I known that the flavor would be bland across the board I wouldve just stuck with crab legs and dessert... those were the only things that I was actually excited about. Everything else could have been served at a Golden Corral and I wouldn't have known the difference. Bland...and/or dry... and/or folks trying to be clever with cooking foods that are better left keeping it simple. 
The turkey wasn't too horrible... but it wasn't good enough that I felt the need to try the other meats they had to offer..which wasn't much if I recall correctly. The mashed potatoes were bland. I had been craving pots mashed, too... so that really got me down. They had some fancy macaroni that just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I'm too country for Aria's buffet... but come on... what's a buffet without good ol' macaroni and cheese?!
If you want crab legs mid week...swing through here.. if you don't mind dropping about $40. We had a comp for a BOGO free dinner buffet (MyVegas game on Facebook) so that's what got us in...but I think that after leaving there...we will not be returning."
e74bgU6vTgGfdK2m-xrmeg,4,"I really really really like this gym. It is not overcrowded and the equipment isn't falling apart. I pay $41 per month, which may seem a little steep but it includes the classes. I was a member at 24 hour fitness, which was terrible. I paid $29 per month for equipment that was falling apart and 1980s decor. This gym is modern, hip, and has a TV on every elliptical! I think it is fairly priced and I'm not locked into a contract. I am happy to say that I recommend this gym!"
N-ORv19owtSeAaWsuQEneg,4,"When you go to a place like this expectations are high... and they should be at these prices. Tom Colicchio delivers on his promises. Nothing pretentious... clean simple really good food. Is it worth the money... that's a whole different topic of discussion. But I left very happy.  I shared a rib eye and a hanger steak with my friend. Both were cooked to perfect medium rare. The wine reduction was just right. Sides- salad greens, red peppers, spinach... all good. My other friend had the Filet and he was disappointed. That's why I don't order the filet it usually does disappoint!"
5125fZO6mwDO1k9_jjXN-A,3,"I hadn't checked the reviews, This IHOP was just close to where I had the gang this morning and I wanted to take them out to breakfast, so we went.  I mean its IHOP, how different can it be right?

DO NOT GO TO THIS IHOP!

It was average busy and we were seated relatively quickly.  Admittedly we were a big group (10).  Then a few more small groups came in and they asked us to move for a moment, and by moment they meant get up and go back to waiting so they could seat the other groups.  They had plenty of other seating, just too broken up to accommodate our group, but would have been fine for the others had I thought to make an issue of it before we were already up.  

Then we heard the waitress complaining that she wasn't going to waste her time waiting on teenagers.  Admittedly, most of the kids I had with me were teenagers, but I'm in my 50's and was paying (if concern about teenager tipping was an issue).  After 20 minutes I gave up and took my kids somewhere else.  I don't remember the last time I was treated this badly at a restaurant short of when a staff member was melting down, and even then management can say its sorry.  Here management is in on the bad service.  I guess they know they get enough business off the IHOP name to now worry about customers coming back."
QVuiIYPW9kVZfAiKHdyxHA,4,Nice atmosphere and service. Selection of tacos was terrific; we loved the banh mi taco and buttermilk chicken tacos. We did not love the brisket taco (too fatty).  Tasty margarita. We tried two guacamoles; they were only okay - taste didn't pop. (At home we use more lime and salt.)
qxxAw3JQE9t8Qdy7KyUBUQ,5,"Oh, come on. The donuts here are spectacular! I went, obviously, at the wrong time of day (late afternoon), and I didn't have a full display of choices but got some awesome donuts. I love simple donuts, and I was happy to find some great ones here. They weren't covered in various cereals or bacon and bananas, but simply topped with classics (sprinkles, chocolate glaze, maple glaze, etc.). The kronuts are supposed to be worth a try (my girlfriend tried one and said it was awesome). You cannot go wrong with place. It's a long drive up for me but totally worth it."
6ZO-b7JvgDRYUyQIs43QBQ,4,"Small restaurant. Very cute inside - string lights, walls have large colorful birds painted on them.  We had dinner there. I had that night's special which was turkey pot pie, which was delicious. The small side salad accompanying the dish was just as good. For dessert, I had the coconut pie. It was light and creamy."
ehGHot-N043qh4-TfoDsnA,4,"Just went here yesterday for dinner because of the promotion they were having. As usual there was a long line during the dinner hours so if you are in a rush, try to avoid going around 5-8 p.m. lol. I got the sweet pork burrito which was pretty good (it's my go to dish). The pork itself has a lot of flavor since it is drenched in sauce. If you are trying to be a little healthier they have a wheat tortilla option.  The portion is nice and they put the lettuce and pico de gallo outside of the burrito which was kind of weird at first. I usually get cilantro as well. It's worth trying this place out if you haven't been yet and are tired of going to Chipotle. I do have to say that their chips and guacamole pale in comparison to Chipotle in terms of flavor."
nvRVrnjwc4crn_F5VWyHnA,3,"Always great selection, often dubious value.  

I love the selection that the plenitude of food trucks offers.  However...  Ostensibly, the reason for operating a food truck is to reduce the cost of doing business since you don't have to pay for a building, for wait staff, for utilities, and all the other overhead costs that a traditional restaurant incurs.  You can then pass these savings on to the customer with lower-cost food.  However, the reality is that the food trucks charge MORE than traditional restaurants.  For example, I can get three tacos for $6 or $7 at Chipotle, better yet I can get two tacos around the corner at Pedro's for $3.50, so why would I want to pay $10 for three tacos from a truck?  Are they probably better than my $3.50 tacos?  Sure, but double-the-cost better?  Sadly no, there are not.  I think the food trucks get away with a little overpricing due to the food-truck hype, the novelty, and the fact that mostly all of them seem to have the same relatively inflated prices.  If each food truck was delivering exquisite gourmet delicacies, then the prices would perhaps be perfectly justified but most of them are not.  Most of them are delivering average fare, perfectly acceptable but nothing special or remarkable about it or the ingredient selection.  Given that there are tons of local places nearby serving mostly the same food for less, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay more for the same thing from a food truck.  The novelty of the event has somewhat of a redeeming value.  It certainly serves as an interesting thing to do for lunch to break up the daily M-F routine.  Will I go back?  I'm sure I will.  Will I leave, as usual, wondering at how little food I got for my money?  I'm sure of that, too."
tdwdOZHilsJqnPXvF2zOsQ,5,Had the salmon scramble . Flavor explosion in my mouth. The potatoes are crispy to a perfection. Love the Rosemary touch . Portion sizes are gimmicky like claim jumper but the quality of the giant pancake is fantastic.
FtRO_RN_kGZc2-7KzA0VEQ,5,I came here for the first time with my dear friend who comes here frequently. We are both Long Island transplants and totally enjoying the foodie experience. I had the chorizo scrambler which was out of this world delicious... I will finish it for dinner later!! My friend had French toast w whipped cream & strawberries..she licked the plate clean so very yummy. I will be back many times!!!
fUOK-W7ikkYdhBRDzDteQA,5,Just had my pool remodeled and Above and Beyond Pool Remodeling took it from a tacky 90's pool to a desert oasis! I will recommend them every time over and over again. We previously had a quote from another local company that charged hmmm about $2000 over for the same thing. There team took us through the entire process and made us feel secure that strangers would be invading our backyard. Thank you to the best pool remodeling company since 1999!
G7dDq-lQvjqftq80t148Rw,1,"Upon redeeming my 4 vouchers, the venue claimed that the show was SOLD OUT for the groupon tickets and the only way we could redeem them was to UPGRADE by paying $10 MORE per ticket. That performance was the only one that we could see due to our schedule. As the usher was seating us, (In the very last row, furthest from the stage, I might add), I noticed that there were several empty seats and asked if the performance was sold out. She actually laughed and said ""Not even close - it's never sold out"". I didn't want to go out during the show to try and complain, so decided to wait until after the show was over. Upon leaving the theater, the entire will call/box office area is packed up gone and lights out. There wasn't a soul around. This is very unacceptable for the venue to cheat people out of money. I am requesting the additional $40 to be refunded. The show was fine, but the venue operation/management and employees are SNAKES! The cashier probably pocketed the ""extra"" $40 that I paid since it was in cash and he didn't even open a cash drawer. Probably does this all the time."
ZbX4ZZ8u96cxnKtFCVZr2w,1,"I usually bring a few of my friends here every week. Me being a local from Las Vegas on a Wednesday they denied me. I was pretty disappointed and the ""manager"" who walked me out wouldn't give me his name. The security who sees me on a regular was surprise too. He told me to go to the girl on the counter and she  was nice too and she tried to get me in but wasn't successful. She told me taxi drivers get paid $85 to drop off guest here and they charge $45 at the door. I don't know what's going on with them today but the service is terrible. The worst part is that I was embarrassed in front of my friends because I wasn't taken care of. I wished I tried to go in first before they had paid. Very disappointed. Please advice.
I don't think I'll bring my friends here again."
IVF-Tx4qN-oCgubMCA93pw,5,"My new favourite hotel in Montreal.

Rooms are massive; you get a living room, a kitchen (full fridge, stove, dishwasher, and microwave), a giant bathroom, and a bedroom. Kitchen has no cutlery/plates/etc but you can request them by calling downstairs. If you're lucky your suite will have a giant jacuzzi (i'm 6'2"" and i fit in like a glove).

I was here as part of a group so internet was included for free (pro-tip: it's always free in the lobby).  As someone who travels a lot the internet was good: it was stable and had adequate signal throughout the suite.  Anyone who expects speedy/cheap internet in a hotel is naive (or hasn't done much travelling). I got strong LTE signal (Rogers) on my phone, so could have tethered too.

Each room night comes with a free drink and complimentary breakfast, alas sleep came over food so i didn't get to try out the breakfast, and didn't care about the drink. Parking is $23/night and includes unlimited in/out privileges: it's a small lot so you might need to park at the convention centre down the street if you're in big SUV (or suck at driving in tight spaces).

THE WINDOWS ACTUALLY OPEN.  Sorry for caps-lock but so many hotels are so concerned about people jumping that they bolt all the windows shut.  My co-worker had a smoking room and was shocked to find the ability to open the window.  The non-smoking rooms have newer/nicer furniture than the smoking ones (and obviously don't reek of smoke).

Only downside is that none of the rooms have a view (unless you count construction and other room windows as a view). Also there are only two elevators that are sometimes so slow they feel like they're being hand-cranked. No free water bottles either."
gXn5aJkTgv1ND7txVi0AHg,3,Came here because of reviews recommendation and when I got here I didn't feel like a burger so I had the pork Ramen which was very good pork belly I would eat here again with friends but I would not drive across town for it.

We love going to this office for our vision needs. The doctor and his staff are all so friendly and helpful. They have Saturday hours so it is very easy to get an appointment that will work with our schedule."
xq8YvDbEZlqqpEdqO8d0XA,1,"I have given this place several tries, and 4 out of 5 visits absolutely sucked. There is never anyone who knows how to PROPERLY do the dip nail products that they advertise. My nails are bumpy, have bubbles in them and were not all shaped the same. It's rundown, the wallpaper is peeling, the pedicure chair was old and did not work properly.
This place is not worth the money that you pay for services. It's close to home, but I will not be back."

5fny8ECF8_0MYdUjjOT2eQ,5,"I've been here twice now in the past 2 weeks. The first time we came to dine in because it was a new business and we wanted to see what the inside was like. We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. The price was perfect. The owner (I'm assuming) brought the pizza out to us personally and gave me ranch, free of charge. Once we took a couple of bites another employee came to check on us. The second time we ordered and picked up for some friends that were coming over. We got the buffalo chicken and pepperoni pizza and we won everyone over with this. I love this place! The service was amazing, the pizza was amazing, and the employees were amazing. It's also conveniently close to my house. :)"
itWvooGaBaeBMxvNxfTu-Q,5,"This place is well out of the way from the strip but as a result, you get a good combination quality and not having to pay a fortune like you would for some other buffets back on the strip. 

We came for the seafood dinner buffet. There was a huge variety of options that could keep you going for hours. All the meat carving stations were on point. The desert section had lots of unique options that most of the buffets on the strip will not offer. The waitress in charge of our table was excellent. If you are making a shortlist of buffets to visit while in Vegas and you are willing to make the trip to Henderson, give this place a shot - you will love it."
4f56CIAwl7rK_azmUm4gow,4,"Well, it looks like the West Valley is good for something - bagels. These babies are the real deal and they also taste perfect out of the freezer as well. Boiled, then baked is the only way to make bagels and since this side of town lost a few places, the search was on for this NY item. Well, now the search is over. I have tried nothing else, but toasted, fresh or frozen, these bagels (some a bit odd shaped) are top notch."

o4QEOKKJ8s9qezOtaNTjaA,2,"My husband and I recently visited Camp Social after getting a bit too excited about their menu and hearing recommendations from colleagues, but unfortunately we didn't read enough reviews beforehand because the food is definitely not worth what it cost and the overall experience was very mediocre.  The atmosphere seemed fun if you're in a large group wanting some cool photos and have no interest in having a tasty meal.  The place is over the top decorated with ""camping"" equipment (and ginormous TVs everywhere, because football is outdoorsy..?) but it is not where I could imagine anyone who actually enjoys camping or the outdoors going.  More Housewives of Scottsdale (sorry, Scottsdale) than Bear Grylls.  The most fun part was people-watching as distracted marshmallow-toasting patrons accidentally caught things on fire and made total messes with their s'mores.  My fish fry, made with some mysterious ""ocean fish"" had zero seasoning or flavor whatsoever, and my husband described his pasta as ""interesting"" and not in a good way.  The service was fine, the place seemed clean and cared-for, but they need to overhaul their kitchen if they're going to make it, based on our experience and the reviews I'm seeing."
JXYKk4sPj0YKVh9gvPH78w,1,"I would not go back to this location. I've gone to three other locations for many years and had plenty of good experiences, but this time it turned out all wrong. My hair looks like it does when I spend a quick 30 minutes blow drying out my curls myself. There was a miscommunication about what I wanted, I guess - I was asking for a ""classic blowout"" - and though the girl doing my hair was nice and tried to fix it, it was too late (my hair had dried in spots and the subsequent attempt to blow it out left it kinky, poofy, and frizzy). I wish she'd used their hair menu as I was just looking for the ""red carpet."" I didn't realize the full extent of how bad it looks in the back until I took a closer look after leaving the location, or I would have complained on the spot. I am totally bummed I wasted $60 on this."
7HlYr_S5SIfpeAd_9uSkFQ,2,"Not enough staff to clean the tables. Many tables and window tables had trash for over thirty minutes.

kaeBTgunowIgV6zLfnkYJQ,1,"Not a good first visit at all. Don't get the poke bowl. They have no idea how to cook rice. That's not even the worst part. Our server, she was TERRIBLE!!!! Barely spoke to us, couldn't care less about my dislike of the food, lacked any sort of hospitality, and looked like she couldn't wait to quit her job. Furthermore, you're a new restaurant fighting for sales. If I'm the manager, and I hear that someone didn't have a good experience, I'm surely going to talk to that customer.  I give them less than 6 months."

gXBvDwxSc9kIYLKaK4GPGg,2,"Trader Joe's as a concept is hard to resist.  Everything you need on a regular basis is under one ""hood"".  Never mind that we don't know the exact provenance of branded items, with bags of ""designer"" salad at less than $3, who has time for trivial questions?  As it turns out, there are major inconsistencies with specific brand products with respect to quality control.  On a recent trip, I made the fateful decision of trying what they label Multi-Grain Country Style Bread.  If there is ANY bread out there that tastes more like wood pulp, I'd be really surprised.  Also disappointing was the bulk-sliced white cheddar cheese, albeit the ""lite"" variety, which had a synthetic and bitter quality all it's own.  It also had sticky paper in between each slice which may be a problem for sight impaired or the elderly.  Finally, the low sodium turkey was also low flavor, save for a smoky aftertaste that was likely the last stop on the assembly line where it was packaged.  

As with restaurants, I hate playing russian roulette with my own money, and for that reason, I will patronize places like Jenifer St. Market when I want a local version of the above chain."
KWtr0mpHtwjgdy4vPeIn0Q,5,"I believe this is the best sushi spot in Las Vegas. My wife and I go here whenever we feel like eating sushi. When it comes down to staff, service, the great modern vibe, and specially the food, it is always the best. 

I'm not sure what people are complaining about this place because we don't see it or feel from them any negative vibe but I believe it's the best AYCE sushi. The taste of the food has great flavor and also you get the food pretty quickly.

I recommend this place whenever you want sushi or you got some friends or family to visit this is the place to eat."
1iV4mfJEBHzRxSlzI71evw,4,"After hearing great things, and loving sushi, I had to try Wild East...And was it worth it, YES.  All the reviews seemed to be during the weekday lunch hour crowd, I wanted to see how they were on the weekend.  I walked in and was greeted, seated, and attended to very quickly.  The servers were very attentive and assisted with any questions I had regarding their speciality rolls.  After taking the servers suggestion for the Valentine Roll, there was no disappointment. The Carmel Roll was also amazing.  We also enjoyed salad and soup, which I would say the soup was not worth it.  Overall, this was a great sushi experience in Charlotte.  And, as I walked out and saw the Asian entrees, I was curious... I may head back tomorrow and try something new.  Keep you posted."
F5sOoHxrIbxh1n-O6DFPuA,4,"Delicious greasy south Sri Lankan food, awesome.  The egg roti and vadai are absolute perfection, though it's a bit disconcerting that the bag they come in is pretty much see-through an hour later.  This place in a once-in-a-while treat, but what a treat it is!"
LG8qoRqjUjLIuQoEIAEl2g,3,Good service. I asked for gel polish and was told they do a gel manicure. I didn't want all the extras but didn't have a choice. Will look around to find another option to just have my nails painted and not have to pay $35.
CK0viJsS_bf7jRYDhid5vA,4,"My fiancé and I ordered their chicken sandwich to share, and their portion is huge. So either go with the mini or order their normal size sandwiches if you have a big appetite or for sharing. We added provolone cheese, mushrooms and jalapeño peppers, and surprisingly the jalapeño peppers had some good heat!

I've been to California sandwiches in the Queensway location, and had their schnitzel and nothing to brag about. But this chicken sandwich was the bomb. It was packed with some sweetness and tang from the tomato sauce, and nice heat from the jalapeño and balanced flavours.

The only downside is the bottom half of the bun gets soggy if you order it to go. Otherwise it's amazing and I'll be back for sure!"
HqWyn4igHyqklODUpv_wag,1,"We've tried to buy vehicles from this dealership on two separate occasions and have been very disappointed.  The first time we were looking for a sports car for the summer.  There wasn't much on their lot but we wandered around for a few minutes.  A salesman came out and tried to sell us something with a beige interior (I hate beige).  When we said we weren't interested, he kept pushing for a reason until I told him I hated beige...to which he asked, ""why don't you like beige?""  I'm not even sure how to justify not liking a colour...  The second time we were looking for a small truck to replace my old one.  We asked about their trucks and the salesman said they had some in the back, but didn't offer to show us any.  When my husband asked, he informed us we could wander around and try to find one if we wanted, but he wasn't sure where they were exactly.  Then he tried to sell us on a big SUV instead.  We test drove it, hated it, told him it wasn't what we were looking for, and he proceeded to ask, ""well what can I do to get you into this SUV?""  Um nothing.  So we went elsewhere and won't be looking at this dealership ever again just because of bad salesmen."

VyZYwP7pi5ArZ4X5mF-WTQ,5,I don't usually write reviews but I need to give this place 5 stars for sure. This place is a heaven for chicken tandoori lovers. I haven't had better grilled chicken tandoori and biryani than this place. There buffet is worth the price with a lot of options. The only thing I would say is that there isn't a lot of options for veggies out there but the owners is always kind enough to add something special if there's a veggie in the house as well. I would Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving for good authentic Indian/Pakistani food.
rs2KGr8c9rqgzy6Y9C2jSA,3,"Today I had the Magical Mystery Tour pizza. It was unexpectedly good.  The mushrooms and jalapenos were a good mix of flavors along with the pesto sauce.  But it could have used a little more mushrooms considering the price I paid.  I was reluctant to go back since the last time I went I paid over $15 for a build-your-own salad, which came with wilted greens and were stingy with all of the ingredients that you had to add. I was hard pressed to find the mushrooms, avocado (not even a full slice) and olives that I added, basically all the extras besides the wilted greens.  

If you're eating there and ordering pizza be prepared to wait, it's not ideal for a quick lunch. And be prepared to shell out a few dollars.  The food is not cheap! The likelihood of returning to Mellow Mushroom for lunch would be minimal at this point, but I do hear they have good Happy Hour deals.  Maybe I'll see you then."

ItP80GWFEEgv9tIUgc3jbQ,5,"Not only is the food always delicious and fast, the employees at this location are wonderful. This past weekend I ate here and when I got home realized I had lost my keys. Not sure where I lost them, I came back to Panera (last place I remember seeing them) and three different employees helped me look around for them. When we didn't find them, two employees dug through two bags of trash just in case I threw them out. They wouldn't even accept a tip! Other employees offered other suggestions of places to look for my keys/places to go to for help. Truly great service on all fronts."

It's hard to chill out like a ""gentleman"" in the presence of meth pipes and the like.  Sadness...."
L4CFvJ2RbxYUgLxb_fT8PA,5,"Love this place....took one star off because I think the meat portions could be a bit more. Freash, delicious, friendly staff and nice location. This is a great lunch spot for you to ride solo or take a friend. I ate the entire salad including the taco shell bowl. Prices are good and the service is quick as well as efficient."
JeqeHw36IKEKoPYFMGxJFg,3,"The prices are the main reason I'm giving this establishment such a low rating. I work in the building they're in. A deli sandwich, poocorn, and fruit cost me $13. I could have gone to nearly any restaurant and had a full, sit-down meal for that price, tip included. The food was fine, but due to the prices, I'll never go again."
sQfIZdeCIu3RncChRulCjQ,1,"Disappointed.  The cream soda my husband was looking forward to tasted watered down.  He said his fish tacos had no flavor.  The same for the sauerbraten. There was no hot sauce or salsa for the fish tacos.  Tabasco sauce was offered but never delivered. My husband thought the name Sprechters would live up to their brand.  There is no sense describing each parcel of food as it all was bland and we are not picky eaters.  The only thing we got out of our $40 lunch was full.  The wait staff was friendly.  This is one of those ""been there, no need to go back"" places.  They have a large menu but we have no interest in trying again.  The dogs are getting my leftovers as I ate less than1/4 of my $16.99 meal."
rJL0jlFtHR8dj8O2gGjhSg,3,"I happen to LOVE the Bikini!  Went here the other night after my gig.  It was pretty empty (Wednesday night) UNTIL 11:30 when the place got a crowd.  I was wondering ""Who the heck goes out this late on a Wednesday night?""
You know it's becoming something more popular when the parking lot is filled with Audis and Beemers.  
The bartender lady was a peach!  
I like the high-top tables.  Kind of retro-metal and they were clean.  You'd notice if they were dirty because of the sheen.  The booth we were in was HUGE and really comfy.  
The jukebox is pretty good, though they didn't have the Pantera I was looking for.  I don't think that's a Bikini fault, though.
I like the mixed crowd.  It reminds me of the old Jugheads.  All walks of life and really nice people to talk to.  When I can go up to a stranger at a bar and shoot the shit for a moment, it's a cool place.
Yeah, it may be a little stinky, but it's a DIVE BAR."
gVoLAykPdJ9KzntNNBS5zA,2,"Our waitress was great! Service was not the reason for the bad experience. 

The one star stems from first off, charging us $2 for sharing when we had 4 orders. C'mon now. I get if a party of four order 1-2 oxtail soup and share, I can understand that. But we had four orders of food, and you tack that on without a mention? You bet we had a talk with the supervisor about it to remove that. The supervisor was very rude about it after.

Secondly, the steak and eggs that my boyfriend got was gross. The steak is comparable to golden corral and legit tastes like ass once swallowed. My boyfriend also threw up after eating it. 

Third, oxtail soup was good but not so amazing to bring me back here. We went to Orleans the next day as they now served oxtail soup late night as well. The broth at Orleans was much better.

Waited in line for a good 30 minutes before getting seated in this empty restaurant just to be charged for unreasonable fees and eat ass steak. No thanks."

The instructor was nice and helped make us all feel comfortable. We had a lot of fun and learned a few things to use on our better halves! 

Not to mention you get a great work out in the process. We felt great and the package deal was worth it for me and my friends! Would recommend them to anyone!"
7oBRobbAS-TXo5slA2J5xw,1,"Let me begin by saying that I wrote an email to the owners of the Flying Fig on December 1, 2013, and have yet to receive a response. It has been two whole months since then -- callous and unacceptable. The owners obviously do not care.

This was my message:
""Had brunch at the Fig on Sunday. Ordered a Bloody Mary and an orange cocktail (acceptable). Also ordered Biscuits & Gravy (good) and Migas (okay). But what killed our experience was the HORRENDOUS service.  

Our server, Josh, was distracted and did not check on us.  When he did come he did not demonstrate knowledge of the menu.  I asked which he would recommend, between the omelette and Migas.  He ummed, ahhed, and failed to provide a coherent response. When the food came he did not see if the items were to our liking. When we asked for the check he delivered it and then failed to come back for our credit card in a timely manner. He walked by our table several times before I flagged him down in desperation. Instead of apologizing he feigned surprise. Terrible.

Suffice it to say the service we experienced at your restaurant left much to be desired. I hope that you will take these comments under advisement."""

ufjlXJzwCYYZcVz0lmMzLg,3,"A beautiful restaurant in the heart of downtown Montreal with a beautiful setup. We got there around 9h30 pm & the kitchen was still open! The staff was very friendly as well. We ordered our plates & didn't wait too long; I ordered ribs which came with a poutine plate. The Ribs were rubberry, but the poutine was good, although I had to ask for more sauce. The steak dans son jus was perfectly cooked. The lamb was alright but nothing to wow me. Now the Grilled Octopus was a real disappointment! Not only did it have a strong fish taste but it was very rubbery as well. I've been to Vargas before & I do recall that the food was better. The highlight of the evening was the meeting of the Cabral family (house of Porto & wine in Portugal) who were dining as well & sent us glasses of Porto. We chatted with them & left with a promise to meet them again next year at La grande dégustation des vins du monde!"

ZTeOUUruDIpUIVp8PluEbg,4,"My husband and I went here for our anniversary and had a great experience. It was a little pricey but the food and service were worth it. I think this is by far the best ""special occasion"" restaurant in the Phoenix area. Not as snobby as some of the places in Scottsdale resorts and far better food than Compass downtown. 

We started off at the bar since our table wasn't ready when we arrived. They have a variety of specialty martinis. The ""Great Fruit"" was a good sweet and fruity cocktail and the candied grapefruit slice made it special. I ordered the ""SKOCU THU"" which had a bit of spice to it and was garnished with a dried chili. It sounds weird but it was amazingly good! Definitely one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The bartender also made a smaller sized Mesquite Bean Martini for us to sample which had excellent flavor but I think you have to like Bourbon to truly enjoy it. 

As for the food, the menu is a little different and requires an adventurous palate. I enjoyed the Native American influence and focus on local food. We ordered an appetizer that had cured ham, raw fish, and buffalo tartare, which worked well since it had a variety of items to try and was a good for sharing. There was a small soup included in the meal (just a taster size) and also sorbet to cleanse the palate between courses. My husband ordered the Buffalo as his entree which was a good size and he said it had excellent flavor. I had the Seafood Potpourri which was also excellent though I am not sure how that fits in with their Southwest theme. The only criticism of the menu that I have is that the only poultry item was duck. So, if you are not a game meat or seafood person you would be out of luck. I did appreciate the fact that they had a good selection of half-bottles and wine by the glass because after the martinis we could not have handled a full bottle of wine. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse for dessert and so that was a nice surprise but I think otherwise they still provide truffles as a finish.

I highly recommend Kai as a place you must try at least once, but be prepared to spend some money."
BBALfWRg7MphhYXwzSVOmQ,3,"Just say NO! The rooms were fine except for the construction 24 hours a day outside. The price was fine except the hidden #20 a day 'resort fee' magically tacked on at the end of our stay. The pool was fine, or at least it may have been had it been open, hell they told us on the phone it was! The wait in line to check in was fine except the for all the tourists. The $9 well drinks and $7 domestic beers were fine as long as you got them free at the tables and not the terrible bars. The showers were fine except the leaking fixtures and sandpaper towels. The whole experience was just fine, except that it wasn't and I would not recommend anyone ruining their Vegas trip with this crap hotel. Oh, and fuck your $20 bagel + $3 room service fee + $14 WIFI charge."
W4-FZR5uLhszcGXIB6A1VA,1,"Wow, so bad. Westin. You hear that brand and think upscale, clean, modern, comfortable. This lake las Vegas location is anything but... I'm only going to talk about the amenities I used. The room: imagine a Westin heavenly bed, now put it inside a motel 6 (dirty, used, empty, old). That's the room here. Walls are paper thin (possibly worse than my college dorm). Water pipes/drainage in bathrooms from adjoining rooms sounds like they're gonna flood my room. Convention/Meeting rooms: Uhm, it got the job done? Gym: lol. Not a gym. Smelled like mold/must. Terrible equipment. Dbs up to 50 (nothing new here). Venue: it's on lake Las Vegas for Pete sake...you don't have to do much here...

Pick up the slack Westin, you couldn't pay me to stay here. Good thing the company picked up the tab for this conference. Hire a professional to remodel this dump and earn those 4 diamonds you hang in the lobby."
Yydp8T7RehW0dxZwnQ17uQ,4,"This is exactly what I needed on my way home from a night out in Charlotte. The space is beautiful, open and bright. There's a lot going on but the menu is easy to read. They offer shots, monster shots, juice combinations, and food. I finally settled on WE GOT THE BEET, a combination of beet, carrot, apple, ginger, and lemon. It was perfect! The earthiness of the beets, the sweetness of the carrot and apple, combined with the zing and tang of lemon and ginger, all worked so beautifully. I would definitely stop by again if in the area!"
oPLS_C_3sp2P5A2YsQhEDA,4,"Pullman is a place you have to choose to go. It's not on the way to anywhere, and it's not close to anything else particularly. Consequently, It took me a long time to get round to going. But I loved it.

The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... 

The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.

I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)

I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while."
3aBROOAT7vDILV_fZL2cIA,3,"Pretty much a mixed bag.  I'm a newbie to the area but so far, they have the best frozen dessert option ever. The custard is amazing!  Great flavor, and a very smooth texture.  The Butter Burger has actually replaced Five Guys as my favorite fast/casual burger.  The cheese curds are quite possibly the best in the business and the fries are always cooked perfectly.  But with all of that good comes some bad.  The fish is overpriced and just ok, I expect amazing when I'm paying $12+ for fast food fried fish. I'd pay $7 for it any day but never again at $12.   The chicken tenders were possibly the worse chicken tenders I've ever had.  Greasy, small, and not whole chicken . . .  more like a bigger nugget.  I ate one and threw the rest away."

uvY5Cca6WjTHmeCQFzsC_A,1,My dog wonder off late night 2 days ago then someone found him and took to this animal hospital and drop him off for someone to claim. I posted lost dog ad on Craigslist the person called told me that they left my dog at the hospital so went there soon got the call around 530-6 in the evening and I ask for my dog. They said he was not there so called the person who found him and they said he is there so just kept telling the staff he is here and they said you have to come back tomorrow when we open I was like are you serous this is my dog I thought about calling the police but not sure would done any good the next morning as soon as it opened I went there and yes my dog was there and the staff was great I can't believe the people on the late shift would not open 5 min to get my dog and would rather have me stand outside to wait and tell to come back but I'm so glad to get my dog back!!!!
FGsh1My8qmyH3BCjcxYyag,1,"What a horrible experience! I made a logo with the paint program but needed someone to help with the sizing and resolution or whatnot for business cards so I talked to the graphic designer whom I assumed did things like this before with a $35 an hour minimum charge but after waiting weeks and receiving no quote, call back, or a simple email telling me it couldn't be done apparently my project was swept under the rug and forgotten."
Z9gxiSflwJRE4V6iWeJU_g,5,"We recently moved into the state and started looking around to purchase a home. We weren't sure where to start. The area was new, we knew no one and thought it may take some time to find a house with all of our check marks.

We met Bruce at an open house, where we found him to be approachable and knowledgeable of the area. He was helpful in narrowing down areas that would meet the requirements for our search, as we wanted to be close to work and schools that our children were attending. He quickly found us a beautiful house that met most all of our realistic needs and wants. He was very helpful in negotiating and guiding us through the process, as it is a bit different than other areas of the country we had owned. Answered ALL of our questions and when he did not have an answer, went out of his way to find what we needed to know. Never thinking twice for perhaps some of our odd questions, like about scorpions and desert living.

Very easy to deal with, supportive and always seemed available for us.  Even after the closing, he checks in on us to make sure that we have what we need and are happy with our decision. We would highly recommend Bruce for any of your real estate needs. We hope to utilize his skills again when the need arises."
oiU57nXxmdaKajjTJYeJbw,3,"So I succumbed to the sage chicken benedict.  Served with a spear of rosemary and the knife OJ was missing down the middle.  Not a lot of comments here other than to say this place has made huge portions and weird combinations a winner.  

BTW - The bloody mary was killer."
m0OUaVGwJCVatiR-Q9K7YQ,3,"This place was just okay, some items were great but some, like the lobster was subpar. We ate dinner here and were seated after a short wait. The owner was attentive as we looked at the menu, but it was 25 minutes before we got water and the waitress took our order. 
Highlights here were the egg drop soup, the green beans and the E- fu noodles with tofu added. 2 at our table got the lobster and neither was tender or sweet. The black bean sauce was tastier then the garlic sauce.
For us not worth the long drive into town."
BWD16FbZg0OeCIkcekkQUg,2,It was ok. Nothing special. The coupons have to many restrictions on them. Jasmine's is much better and more choices.
lNuD6Ndh4zfbzVpF5MVJzQ,1,Do yourself a HUGE FAVOR!!!! DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO USE THIS COMPANY FOR ANY SERVICE AT ALL!!!! Left me on the side of the road for 5 hours and kept telling me they were on the way. Ended up having to get a different towing company to tow my vehicle. Horrible experience! This company should not be allowed to conduct any type of business...
vg4fJqZIbdI3_UjoV2vgIw,5,"Love this place! Even when they're busy they treat you like family. Not a stuffy corporate store, but still very professional.

XwJU6-pQtkhlMY6GYGO7Yg,5,I've recently had my 3rd treatment here for laser hair removal. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The customer service here is amazing. Loni has been doing my treatments and she's been great about explaining the process and being patient with me.
taMpkx2YOSLpfKQHoKaI8w,4,"Great, great place to get a good sense and feel of what kind of pre-owned car to buy. Its convenient when you want to take a look at a few cars within the same class and/or price range but don't want to drive across town or where ever to try out the others you had in mind. Service was great and hassle free. My sales agent at the time was very professional and I never had any problems in contacting him when I had a few questions for him, but prices are fixed and non-negotiable. 

Minus one star for that ridonkculous ""Carmax"" sticker you have to place on the back of your car upon purchase."
5u-Rbuh8ovDWJ17WJv5fuQ,1,"Well first of, I was born and raised in India and have been cooking now for over a decade, so I'd like to think I have a good idea of Indian food. My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).

I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.

The food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money."
Eir601wPj0E_EVLxB6qrcw,4,"All you can drink mimosas are back! And so is football on all the tv's for that matter! Even better this time it's now on Saturday and Sunday! To my surprise they also have a new ""Hangover Breakfast"". The Hangover breakfast in a nutshell is a handcrafted bloody mary( not a shitty premix) and topped with the usual suspects, a breakfast slider w/egg, sausage on a brioche , w/BACON! Too continue my journey to obesity we ordered the ""Bomb-Digity Nachos"". They don't cheap out here either, no up charge for the goodies like homemade guac, pico, fajita style veggies. Though I can't remember the price I know they were reasonable. I think our bill for 4 of us w/the unlimited mimosas, 2 hangover breakfasts, nachos, and the Nutella Stuffed Waffle (I didn't try it for fear of exploding but looked to die for) after tip was under $80! 
Can't wait to go back next Sunday for brunch again. Next time we will bring Charlie, our golden retriever as I learned on the way out they have a dog friendly patio. 
It's good to see this neighborhood bar back on track with a new menu, happy hour, and friendly staff!"
bAvIhD0F942ewuWndVLZpA,2,"First I will say that the food is delicious. This Pei Wei is by my work and the first time I went there with coworkers everyone else got their food and my food didn't come. Finally I asked what had happened to my food and the person said that they made it with chicken instead of shrimp, but they never asked me what I would like to do. They just assumed I would rather wait than eat a different protein, but it was a work lunch hour, so not the choice I would have made.

Today I needed to run an errand at lunch right by the Pei Wei. I went early so I could order and pay before the rush but wanted it ready to pick up in 20 minutes. After three people tried to delay the order, the store manage said they couldn't do it and I would just have to come back and place the order then. 

I knew it would. E too long of a line then and not enough time and I was incredulous that this was his suggestion and asked what they do when someone calls in an order and he said they can do it then. So I said that if I were calling they could do it but since I was standing in front of them, they couldn't. He agreed and said I could either call or come in later. I told him I would just go somewhere else. He seemed annoyed and reiterated that his computer wouldn't let him do it. 

If it were me, I would have taken the order and money and just told my cook line to not make that order and then in 15 minutes tell them to make it. It's not that difficult when you make customer service the priority."
Q4UtousWbDauBd2FyiYEqA,5,"Wow. This show is the whole package. It's hilarious, it's jaw dropping and it'll leave you wanting more. 

Absinthe is a 90 minute show located in a permanent circus tent outside of Caesars Palace near Hell's Kitchen. There's a beer garden-esque waiting area before you enter into the tent. Every seat in the house is a good one. Grab a first or second row seat if you're hoping to be called out or called up on stage. If you're happy to be a bystander and are looking for the best seats in the house, I recommend row K. Rows A-J are all tightly together and then rows K and L are spaced out on raised seating in the back. I think you'd get the best view from Row K. 

The humor is definitely racist, sexual and raunchy but in all the most hilarious ways. If you can't take a joke, this place is not for you! My sides were splitting and the gazillionaire and his acts had us almost falling out of our seats. 

Besides the humor, the acts were incredible! From death defying stunts to jugglers that made juggling look cool, I was also left in awe at everything we were watching. 

I can see why the reviews for this show are so good. It was incredible and I highly recommend it!"
aYzapVKRgDNxweBgmC7g8w,5,Midwood has been so amazing to my rescue and rescue animals. Derrick and his team truly love animals and have their best interest in mind. We have brought some pretty scrappy looking doggies in and the groomer has made them look like doggies again. Midwood has really provided our community with a  positive impact. We needed something nice on monroe rd haha! All tails are Waggin when we pull up to the door!  Thank you for opening this business and thank you for all that yall do!

They were prompt, professional, friendly and got the job done in the estimated time. They moved and covered all my furniture, put it all back and kept my house clean. I would definitely have them work on my house again."
ubt_K4BWuQrMMRc1bedxkg,4,"Copper is a solid Indian resturant.  The place is fairly small and seating is tight.  I agree with another reviewer who said it is a bit dark inside - it really is.  The staff are friendly and service is usually pretty good.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is very good and the naan is excellent.  The place is fairly expensive for what you get.

Overall a solid inidan restaurant."
Ep7eoMF5qLma_6oQsXADPA,5,"We have stayed for 3 nights in Bellagio. It was something. I mean wonderful.Check in was quick and easy. Even it was so crowded, we were noticed by the front desk clerks. Room was gorgeous and clean.
 Even though our room was facing busy street and mountains, we had a really good time. Housekeeping rocks. Mariela and Adanu took care of our room. They are perfect. Just please, do not move minibar drinks, You are going to be charged. Go to any bar. There are enough super good bars and cafes in Bellagio. We were having breakfast  in Bellagio cafe. Food was delicious. Personnel very nice and kind. They serve very good coffee. Oh, boy...If you want some pastries, go to Palio. Yummy yummy...
Overall..it was an excellent stay. Thank you, Bellagio!..We will come back and let everybody know!............;)"

I got a call from them today, July 8th saying that my appointment is on Friday, July 10 at 12:00 noon and they keep insisting that's what they have for me. I am fed up with the rudeness of the staff at this office and their very unprofessional practices, so I thought I would put it out there."
9KL2vWbQkO1R4fdWTyyzqA,1,So upset about their cakes . We bought a tres leches cake for sons birthday cost us about 18.00 to 20 with taxes and I couldn't believe most of it was whip cream frosting. The cake was about 1' inch the rest was just frosting. Terrible not buying cakes here again.
iTEp2tzOWE-JzXdx0_r62w,4,"The staff with the exception of the bartenders was outstanding. DO NOT DINE HERE!!!!!! Food was fair to shitty, I ate everywhere, but Vodoo.  Room was clean and functional. Casino could have used two more crap tables during prime time. Dealers were pleasant and helpful.
 Unloading and loading is a cluster fuck, if you drive in. The bell staff is competent and helpful. Which offsets the pain of the loading/unloading experience a bit."
lFdY3oP-S9uBdiCcmgQJqA,5,"The absolute best bulgogi bibimbop I've ever had! And they serve delicious poke bowls as their special! 

My family and I stopped in for lunch right when they opened, 11:30am, to an empty house. However, when we were done at around 12:30, the place was packed full of patrons waiting for takeout and being seated! So I definitely recommend coming in as soon as they open. 

Even though my family was the only table, our food took a little while to arrive, but for good reason! Our dishes were absolutely BEAUTIFUL, and tasted wonderful. Around our table was hot stone bibimbop, poke bowl, salmon teriyaki and a volcano roll. Nothing was short of fantastic! I especially loved the bibimbop, the bulgogi was sliced so thin, and marinated so well that you didn't even need a sauce unless you wanted a spicy kick. It had the perfect amount of veggies, it didn't compensate for a lack of protein at all, there was plenty of bulgogi to be eaten in every bite. 

This restaurant's ambience is very nice and cozy. Perfect for a small dinner with friends or a date. It also looks to have a full bar, and a huge sake selection! I would love to come back for dinner and drinks next time I visit Toronto, but I must warn that the stairs down to the washrooms in the basement are a little rickety and steep, so it would be a challenge after drinks lol. The bathrooms themselves are super beautiful though!"
7554xiTKHWVmPM92NMYqZA,4,Friendly staff. I mostly call in for my order and they get it ready by the time i get there. Their diamond ice is really tasty.
jSaTgkV781T3xtyx9C2yJg,1,"The ""happy hour"" portions on the sushi gets smaller and smaller everytime when come to this place.  The service sucks, had to call out for someone come to our table after being set for 15 minutes. The salmon on my and my wife's roll had salmon, and the edges was actually brown instead of pink.  The salmon was going bad.  DONE!  Will not come back to this place!"

AtZwhwB79iedw-C2NNDwFA,4,"My boyfriend took me to The Elm Tree Restaurant for dinner. The atmosphere is romantic and classy. Service was excellent - a server would bring out our meals, then our main server came over to tell us the dish ingredients, cooking style etc.

DRINKS:
Sauvignon Blanc, Eradus (for me) - more on the sweeter end, which I preferred. 
Pinot Grigio, Serenissima (bf)

APPETIZERS:
PAN SEARED SCALLOPS (3/5)
(Seasoned with curry salt, green apple purée)
The scallops were seared perfectly - very delicious. Unfortunately, I didn't think the green apple purée was a good match with the scallops.l, it was too sour. 3 points goes to the scallops though!

MAINS:
DUCK CONFIT (4/5)
(With wild mushroom risotto)
Mm the duck confit was delish! The skin was very crispy with just the right amount of fatty and duck meat. The mushroom risotto was also great - it gets salty after a while but still a great mix with the duck leg. 

PAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS (4/5)
(Saffron infused rice, caper meuniere sauce, diced tomato)
For those who would like something more healthy tasting, this is a good choice. A very light dish - the sea bass was tasty and fresh. I enjoyed this dish very much. 

DESSERT: 
TOFFEE CAKE (5/5) 
You would be missing out if you didn't save room for this dessert!! I looooved this toffee cake. So good - there was a crunchy glazed toffee on top of the vanilla ice cream and the toffee cake is at the bottom. I would come back again just to order this dessert. So so yummy, great end to our meal! :)"
5KhsighTp3DVv6bOAJvHtg,5,"The ambiance is nice and warm as you enter. We ordered the H3 and Phoenix roll and they were both amazing! We also got a complimentary poke from the chef! I am visiting from out of town, and if I ever come back this the area I will definitely come here for sushi!"
SI2L5rVzvmFhic18nuUmSw,5,"Are they pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Yes. 

I like a one stop shop, and Butcher's Market gives you just that, in local products. They have everything from beautiful cuts of meat to craft beer, to veggies and pimento cheese. Everything is always fresh and you can tell that they've put thought into their selections. The cuts are the best of the best, but they're happy to tell you what are second and third best - if you're looking for something more in that price range. You can find cheese in the back - I'm back on a pimento cheese kick, and they have Pasta & Provisions products in the freezer! I stop in here on Saturdays for the Farmers' Market outside, and then stop inside and pick up my meats (and samples!). They have a very large selection of craft beer for a store of this size, and you'll often find not only food samples, but beer samples as well! I love seeing the hyper local regulars - Bird Song, OMB, Unknown, along with some state wide NC breweries. 

The staff is super helpful and friendly, they'll assist in answering any questions and even tell you how to cook/marinate/smoke/prepare the foods that they sell should you need any guidance (I usually do.). They're always grilling something outside on Saturdays, and this has a very strong potential to change your meal plans. I've come in here a handful of times sure that I was looking for marinated chicken, and walked out with steak instead. haha - who's surprised? No one. 

They are a higher priced butcher, but I feel like it is definitely worth it for one-on-one assistance from staff and the quality of meats and foods that you can purchase here. If you want big box store kind of help, go to a big box store. If you want a little more attention to detail and a larger local selection, go to Butcher's Market."

I would highly recommend The Beauty Method to anyone and everyone!"
Ked93MsN3G-OueAERFieUA,4,"What an awesome surprise! This hidden soda fountain packs a serious vegetarian punch. 

Although the decor leaves a bit to be desired, the friendly staff, delicious food, and reasonable prices definitely balance things out and makes this spot a must for vegetarian and carnivore alike! 

There is no question that I'll be back to work my way through their entire menu :) 

(Take the staffs recommendations! They know their menu!)"
7SYm__iVB8eX5S0tUx0Yiw,4,"Nothing better than that black, roasted, salsa they have at their salsa bar. I had no idea they make their chips fresh at the location. I had chicken fajitas and they were great, the corn tortillas that came with my order were warm and fresh, wrapped in tin foil. Was a great meal for a great price."
G25XIDg01VUoX_Nc1BzNxQ,1,"Would have been nice to know my surgery time before the day of the surgery, being that I got there 3 hours early and never was called prior to that morning. Also would have been nice to know beforehand what I owed on the day of the surgery, instead of arriving and getting told ""You owe $900+ today."" Well thanks, because I definitely don't have that right now and had no inclination as to what my bill would be.

The only positives of this experience were my actual surgery, and the RNs and MDs that cared for me. Other than that, this place is terrible."
eigKhUsrgtglY3k6EGFQfg,3,"Went here for dinner based on the reviews and overall I found that the food was very good, but it is really overpriced.  I noticed numerous other reviews say the same about the prices.  One lady I saw said she did NOT think it was overpriced, and quoted that she paid $35 for 1 entrée and 1 appetizer at lunch.  You don't think $35 for a lunch with appetizer is overpriced?  Man, I wish I could live in that world.

The stuff we had was typical ""high end"" fare...exotic sounding ingredients in small, well presented portions.  For 2 people for dinner, we had 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 1 entrée, and 1 dessert...no wine/drinks of any sort and the bill was $100 flat including tax without tip.  The prices need to come down about 20% in my opinion, although I could live with 15%.  As it stands, we really enjoyed the food but it isn't the kind of place we will justify going back to any time soon.  I like great food and I have no issues spending big money on great food, but it is just too overpriced, even for an overpriced haute cuisine type place.

The grilled octopus appetizer was very good.  A nice char with a good blend of flavors from the romescu, potato and avocado, but at $16, it was about $4 too much.

The prawn appetizer was tasty, although they were overcooked.  Also, 4 large prawns in a flavored broth is a bit much at $15.  

The free range chicken breast entrée was very good as well.  It came with a little portion of their tasty mac and cheese, with chile and white cheese (cheddar I believe).  Cripsy on the outside and pretty juicy inside.  Very good, but again, at $23 for 1 large breast and some mac and cheese, it is about $4 too much.

My wife had a nice little peach salad, which was good, especially since peaches are in season.  It consisted of 1 peach, halved, then topped with some kind of cheese and nuts and some other items.  Not exactly a massive serving, and if I remember correctly it was $14 or $16.  1 peach...cut. in. half.  Come on.

The one thing that I felt was pretty fairly priced was the dessert.  I had a peach pie, which came with a nice scoop of ice cream, and it was a pretty decent sized serving, and for $9, it was pretty on point I felt.

Also, they have a delicious little bread basket which is on the house and they even refilled it, so obviously I appreciate that there are other house costs like the free bread that have to be covered, but at these prices you better eat a few baskets.  Not hard to do mind you, especially with the tasty little mix of butter, salt, honey and olive oil they provide.

Overall, the food was great and we had no issues with the service as some others have described.  However, at $100 pre tip with only house water to drink and $118 with tip for 2 people and only ONE entrée and 1 dessert, it was just WAY too much.  $85 pre tip would be acceptable, $75-80 would be better.  Would I return?  Sure...but not anytime soon and probably only on rare occasions.  For that kind of money, they are other places I enjoy and other places I want to try, so I just can't justify working into any kind of regular rotation."

aUj-qbQjhfPytrJqtjrtuA,2,"This seems to be a cursed location.  Nothing has lasted here long.  I've never heard of Tanner's Bistro and when I showed up I thought that location was a sushi place.

The menu was a small tastes menu.  I LOVE tapas, but $8 for a vegetarian eggroll?  I know a quality chinese place that will sell one made in house for $1.50.  Overall, nothing I ordered was especially mind-blowing with the exception of the salad, which I shared with a friend.  

It took over an hour from the time we ordered until we received our food.  

Service was excellent and we were given a plate of samples and a round of drinks for our wait."
K0RjL76eFkH1dLfPKoZeRQ,3,I wanted to like this place bc its close to my house and they are all super friendly but the quality of my manicure and pedicure was not good at all ie:really messy.The polish selection is extremely limited and/or more than half empty. I will pass on going back.
MTEuIXOZu-zsJf-3zrm4sg,3,"The froyo is tasty but they don't have many flavors offered compared to the other places I've been so far. The toppings bar was pretty good but lacked caramel sauce. :( Also I'm not a fan of the store layout. It was busy when I went in and very crowded in a way that it didn't have to be. The flow isn't good. But the sole employee was taking it all in stride, patient, and offering a smile as she rang up each customer. Bonus points to her."
GlgzEYjgN-ysVQLhWIvw_w,4,"This is definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas hands down. However, for me, I think the price you pay isn't worth the food you get. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and the selections are plenty. I just believe that there are other buffets out there in Vegas that compare and are less expensive. With that said, if you have never been to this place, it's one that should be checked off of your list."

S5I0RedIR_6_x6NufmgqNw,5,"My husband has been going to the Game Depot for over 12 years, and he says that it is the best store for board games in Arizona. 

Patti and Dave, owners, are always very helpful when customers ask about a game. There are always people playing games in the store and, when a customer asks about a game, Patti will usually find someone playing who knows the game and can answer the customers' questions.

Approximately one-third of the store's square-footage is devoted to tables for customers to meet-up and play games or for one of the tournaments the store hosts. On any given day, you can find people playing board games, role-playing games, miniatures, card games (e.g., Magic or Netrunner). There are no video games sold at Game Depot. My husband often brings our children, ages 10 and 7, to the store and they often find another child or two to play games with.

The store keeps a good variety of games in stock, but they can and will order just about anything you want. Several game designers and game distributors come through the store frequently, and they are happy to help Dave and Patti get copies of hard-to-find games."
1jnCery6YmRfyYgDZtUbxA,3,"This place is ok. I actually didn't realize before i went in that all they have is ramen. with that tonkatsu pork thrown in. some chicken. I went in thinking it was a general japanase soups place. udon. soba. etc. ramen is my least favourite kind of noodle. reminds me of mr. noodle cups.

well, the food was alright, but the soups they serve would not have been my picks. not a big fan of fried things being thrown in soups. something about that just doesn't work. something fried should be crispy.

anyway, that said, this is a neighbourhood place for me, so if i was really hungry and was sick of eating shawarma on that particular day, i might stumble in again."

I was so excited to eat here but very disappointed."

g_zNeQld61yHFgNqALIV6A,5,"I'm actually from Tucson, but I am compelled to write this review for A1 on behalf of my friend. My friend's garage door wasn't opening one afternoon when we headed back to her house from a day out. A freak thing I guess, monsoons, who knows? I helped her by calling the installer of the door. A1 garage door came out that day, and fixed the problem and even waived the service fee! Quick to respond, great customer service, even helped us understand the problem in case happened in the future. Turns out they service Tucson too and I have a garage door, so it looks like I have a resource for my future needs as well. Highly recommended!"
MfuPqvzJas4c-kc2jGxpSw,5,"Great shop with an amazing selection of board games, role playing games, miniatures, and card games. They have loads of tables and space for gaming of all types and regularly hold events like demonstration days and tournaments for all skill levels. The GM and his staff make us feel welcome and wanted not only as customers, but also as gamers. Would highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."
XxhVDHjZY4B06bksVQfqKw,4,"Nice place. Nice people. Good service. Pancakes were very good. One person with us had an omelet (peppers onions bacon) that was good as well. The breakfast sandwich was fair. Not much to it. And the traditional breakfast eggs, toast, sausage and home fries was just OK.  Greasy sausage patties. Home fries without peppers or onions. But they were happy to add some when asked.  And beware... The butter on the butter toast tasted like movie theater popcorn. Would go back and try some other things on the menu."
tvIF7E26553vFmVE1D9PTQ,2,"Decided to have a lunch date with my boyfriend since the office gives you an hour lunch. We were craving some pho (though we didn't end up ordering it) so we stopped by here. Parking is a nightmare, but just be patient and try the camping technique haha!

The staff here are not the best. Didn't answer any of our questions about the menu and were extremely impatient. They weren't even busy, which is what annoyed me about their attitude. 

I got the vermicelli and you get to choose two toppings. I had shredded pork and the sugar cane shrimp. Neither were very good, but they didn't taste horrible or anything. I just added the fish sauce and some chili to make it a bit more palatable. They really lack any flavour in that dish. My boyfriend tried the curry beef brisket with a side of rice. The curry was a good portion size and flavour was okay. Again, nothing really special.

Service, while rude, is quick, so we easily had time to spare for our lunch hour. Food arrived really quick in good portions. Decently priced. It's a nice spot if you're looking for something quick."

Overall it's a cozy place that's consistent. I have been many times and they don't end up closing early like some places in the city - they are usually open till last call."
0uQM0VHnpcbpVlpZokyFGQ,4,"The fish is amazing! Great taste! Well cooked! The halibut was hot and tender! The scallops were perfectly cooked, though the batter tended to fall off. The shrimp was great - they had been trimmed so no hard tails. I also added a side of fried pickles, which were very tasty! I understand from another customer that the fried mars bar was very good! The only drawback to the meal was the chips, which are placed under the fish, was a bit soggy and not especially tasty. Felt they needed a bit more time and more seasoning. Overall, definitely recommend this, and will be back!"

KZ2Z2M3b6QXyepG_G6sVmA,3,"We had a nice Kitchenaid convection oven with all the bells & whistles. It was great...until one day I decided to use the self-cleaning feature. Unfortunately, the oven overheated before the self-cleaning cycle was finished so I shut it off. After it cooled down, when I turned it on again, it would not heat. (I googled it to find out that this was a common problem in this model of oven that we had. Super disappointing because otherwise, I loved the oven!)  

Anyway, we called KitchenAid to get a list of local repair shops that are KitchenAid authorized & this place was on the list.  So, we called these guys to come out & see if they could repair it. Bad news for us, the oven was too old & Kitchenaid no longer makes the part needed to fix it. (Again, I googled & found that a lot of other people had the same problem of not finding parts when they tried to get the oven repaired). 

So we needed a new oven. We shopped online and found a Whirlpool oven that we liked at the big box stores but these guys had the same Whirlpool oven on sale for a bit cheaper. Plus, we had a discount card from the service call, so we got an additional $50 off. The install cost was less expensive than the quote we got from Lowes too."
BiYr2f0ckWo3JjtqPO64Mw,1,"With thousands of doctors in Arizona, it's not like we don't have other options. If you read all the reviews they seem to be very similar. People have waited exceptionally long times to see the doctor and dealt with incredibly rude staff. The responses from the business owners are usually 'things got crazy, there was an emergency, sorry had to wait'
1. Get better front people that actually care about people
2. Stop over booking appointments; this isnt an airline.
3. If your practice cannot help the sick people that desperately need help, close the shop and go into a profession that has less human interaction.. perhaps a veterinarian. You can make the dogs wait and they won't complain.
4. Stop making excuses and start actually changing the way you do business."

8eRoXtwzx2TCJ6ARqND-pw,4,"I visited Umami when I first moved to Pittsburgh.  While the restaurant gave a fun izakaya vibe, I thought some of the food items were lacking.  I recently visited (a whole year late) and had a better experience.

One of the things I like about Umami is the late Friday and Saturday hours.  The restaurant itself is compact, nested on the third floor where Cantina is.  The entrance is on the side street though.  It was a bit hard to find it during the evening.  It's almost like a izakaya speakeasy! I like what their drink menu offers.  The specialty drinks are well-priced and easy to drink.  Another thing I like about Umami is the serving size.  It's not one of those restaurants where my stomach cries over how small the portions are.  For a party of two, their appetizer size are pretty big to share.

This time, we ordered the chawan mushi, chirashi, tonkotsu ramen, and some handrolls.  I did not like the tonkotsu ramen a year ago.  The bamboo shoot was overpowering the broth.  The broth in tonkotsu ramen is key, and they didn't deliver it.  Since Umami owner is a co-founder of Ki Ramen, I figured to give the ramen a try again.  I LOVE THE TONKOTSU RAMEN THIS TIME AROUND!  The broth isn't very salty but fatty enough.  My favorite part was the bone in cha siu.  I'd come back to Umami for that alone.  The chirashi has a beautiful presentation and good quality fish.  The handrolls were decent, but a little pricier and not much different than other places.  The chawan mushi egg was silky and smooth.  I'd love to come back and try the rest of the menu next time.  Now that I discovered some stand out items, it makes me want to revisit."

There isn't a lot of flavor in their food and their chow mein is consistently overcooked. I've started looking elsewhere for take out around the same price but much better quality. I also work in the food industry and see some health code violations on a regular basis. I'm willing to let bad service go if the food is good but now that both the service and food is bad, I'm done spending my money here. There is no reason to be rude or discourteous.
So sad, because I've been ordering food from them for the last 4 years."

On the first day, John, the owner, answered a lot of my questions, and on the following day, Tommy took my order.  Both were professional and patient with me because I called from Texas, USA, using only the pictures posted on the website.  The flowers were delivered early in the morning of the viewing day.  John called me to let me know, also texted me the picture of the arrangement.  The flowers were artistically displayed, a lot of orchids in white, yellow, and purple that stood out from the dark green leaves in the background.  Later when I received another picture of my brother-in-law standing next to the flowers, I realized the arrangement was also large and the white stand was of better quality than I expected.  My sister texted me that her family displayed these beautiful flowers at the front because they are the best arrangement.  Thank you, John."

They then threatened to call security on me because I was telling another person what happened to us. some lady at the front desk told me to shut up and they were not gonna help us.
I know for a fact they took advantage of my father because English is not his first language. Advantage stands for takes advantage."

We started off with some liquor drinks and I went for their 5$ Jameson special. For lunch my friend and I shared the mushroom goat chases bruschetta which was amazing and a must get if you like mushrooms. We split the steak sandwich and avocado egg rolls for the rest of our lunch and enjoyed those as well. A chill environment during the day time when we were there. Not sure about nights or game days though. Will be back for sure."
etl3Uu6eG_qQUX6lnCcz8g,5,"Rokerij
Made reservaton for 3 PM Mother's Day, but no need, as Rokerij was not on the collective conscious MD list and thus plenty of open tables. The entertainment lawyer from LA turned waiter 4 months previous seemed quite pleasant and pleased to be in his new role and will only become more refined and astute. Just don't bring up Guns N Roses around him...

(Throughout we were attended to by other friendly staff who seemed to get along well with each other, carrying on light banter within ear shot.)

A gentle reminder to all establishments as we enter the ""warm"" season, please keep a vigilant eye on our water glasses. Sometimes even 30 seconds of ice only at the bottom of a glass can cause mild anxiety.

There were 5 different, occasionally overlapping menus (Rokerji's own lunch, breakfast, dinner; Dick's Hideaway; Richardsons) on the table, as well as colorful chalkboards on the walls full of specials. Choice overload.

We settled into a nice, earthy Firestone cab for me, bellini cocktail for my love, homemade lemonaid for teen daughter, and tea for mother-in-law, followed by calamari and tomato bruschetta for pre meal. All eliciting satisfying, ""Mmmm's!"" from a family not known for the gift of describing presentations and flavors in poetic, food critic terms.

Main courses were blackened Mahi w/ beets and trout w/ green beans (2 separate specials from the board) Pasta Heidi, chicken,beef,shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. we all shared, compared and enjoyed. 3 of the 4 dishes are on the spicey good side.. The trout was purposely tame for wife's mother.

Passed up dessert because someone in the party was jonesing for Costco's strawberry swirl and I was set on buying one of those propane tanks with a gauge (refer to pre-Mother's day grilling malfunction); my reward for pulling off - for the first time in a few years - a successful Mother's Day outing.

Thanks, Rokerij. Hope to see you again soon."

We all tried her Jambalaya and agreed that it tasted like canned tomato sauce. She did order a burger after and enjoyed it. Service was quick and friendly overall (had some mix up with our drink orders). They didnt take forever, like many places, after we placed our drink orders. Definitely recommend the Lemon Chicken Picatta and Thai Fried Chicken. Its like Cheesecake Factory so same quality of food. Good place to eat in Vegas that is nice but wont leave a huge dent in your wallet."
zXLZWB6i1i3XnogDAK-G3w,3,"This is an excellent oyster restaurant - it is NOT a good sushi restaurant.  If you love oysters, you will be in heaven at this spot.  This is a must try spot for oysters.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and I found the service to be pleasant and very well informed.  Hopefully, if you dine here you will have a love of oysters because they are fresh, beautiful, large and a very good deal.  I had a mix of the $1 and $2 oysters with the wasabi cocktail sauce, rosemary mignonette and the ponzu salsa.  All the sauces work very well with the oysters, but the ponzu salsa was tangy and fresh and it was the absolute best.  To be able to have a dozen or two of excellent oysters and not break the bank is the number one reason to visit this restaurant.

I was very let down by the nigiri and crudo at this restaurant.  We ordered the nigiri sampler for $15.  The fish on the nigiri was dried out and sliced too thin for the price.  The rice in the nigiri was flavorless.  So many other AYCE sushi joints in this town would shame Other Mama when it comes to nigiri.  We also tried the amberjack crudo.  The flavor of the salsa on the crudo was amazing, but once again the tiny and thin slices of fish were not acceptable for the price ($13).

I wasn't terribly impressed by the cocktails, and I tried two of them.  They were small and the fascinating descriptions of the ingredients just didn't deliver a satisfying drink.  They do have an excellent draft beer selection and I found that tasted better with the oysters.  The next time I go I am just going to order oysters and beer and it will be a 5 star experience.  I recommend everyone else do the same."

The younger cashiers lack aloha and the older lady was flat out rude the last time we were there. She spent 15 minutes arguing with me that I ordered something I didn't. Thankfully I had my receipt to show her what I ordered. Too many Hawaiian food places in Vegas to put up with subpar service."

Professionalism, is important to me regardless of where I am. Not only was she eager to make me feel welcome, but her genuine work ethic set her aside from the other servers and bartenders. The rooftop bar is a great addition, with mildly different decor, it's as if it's a different restaurant. This wasn't my first time or last time visiting. Keep up the good work Shay!!!"

They did raise the prices over the years, understandable. Prices went from 32.50 a head for the brunch to 50 a head but they got rid of all the delicious dishes!!!Last year this place seemed to be going down but this year it's hot rock bottom, THE ABSOLUTE WORST. The room remains decorated the same as always (hint, time to update your decor) bowls glued to the wall, really ??? Hash browns with motz cheese were beyond burnt. The short ribs, burnt and dry. No leafy salad either. Deserts were super sweet. No one manned the omelet bar. Service by the busers, HORRIFIC! Thank goodness we had a great server. Sadly though the server could not help with the poor quality and poor preparation of their food. We will NOT BE RETURNING."

NRtVtPobIrjO7R1i-vYVkg,3,"The Burnt Almond Torte Bar is the main reason to come to this bakery. It's unique flavor is a signature Pittsburgh Treat. I'm not sure if it's the almonds, the crunchy sugar bits, or the custard intermingled with cake, but the combo is a delightful treat. However, beware the other burnt almond tort items just aren't as good as the original. 

Burnt Almond Torte Bar - this is shaped like a log. It's the perfect combo.

Burnt Almond Torte Cookie - it's crispy but lacks the custard feel.

Burnt Almond Torte Cake - we were advised to buy the cake when I asked to walk away with 4 bars. The cake was good but the ratio of ingredients is off. The middle of the cake lacks the crunchies that you get with the bar.

Walking Burnt Almond Torte - this is the newest concept. I'm not sure if I just got an old one. It was the last one in the fridge advertising for these new tortes in a cup. It's pretty much a dry, stale parfait. The layers are packed super tightly into a cup. You have to dig through what seems like an endless clump of cake before you get to custard. It's a miss. Stick to the bar.

The only other Burnt Almond Torte item left is the cupcake. I haven't tried it yet. It looks great with a generous dollop of custard. This item should be a winner but if you want a guarantee pick the bar.

I've also tried their cheesecake which is typical of your standard NY cheesecake. It's simple, solid cheesecake option. No frills solid bakery.

Please also note that the one in market square is expanding. They've taken over the Mancini's Bakery portion of the location."
f52JLEb4nx1g303Fr27PtQ,5,I relocated a year and a half ago from Denver.  This dealership (I've only dealt with the Service Dept) is one of  the best I've ever been to.  The service is superb.  I had dealings with two Audi dealers in Denver and just because they bear the Audi name doesn't mean they give you exceptional service.  I would recommend the Audi North Scottsdale location in a minute.  Wyatt T. has been my service advisor since I moved here.  Appreciate his honesty and hard working attitude.
eFZUj9o_-5jykCsL3DwB7Q,5,"Bhelwala's was fast, convenient, and filling - I had enough leftovers after stuffing my face for a second meal later in the day (or for my husband to steal...grrr). If I lived nearby this would be an easy to-go repeat. The food and options were tasty; I loved the paneer (they gave me a lot and I was sooo excited about it) and the Tikka sauce was good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the naan, but they don't bake it in house- which is normally the draw for me anyways. It's priced a little high for the concept. I think, but for the amount of food you get I can accept that. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and quick to provide samples and answer questions to those apprehensive about the food/combinations - my mom and brother really appreciated this. 

Anyone writing reviews complaining that this isn't authentic Indian food, please quit. It doesn't claim to be. Appreciate it for what it is and take the time to USE YELP and find what you think is ""authentic Indian food"" in CLE. It's great that you can walk in, get a quick Indian fix with less than $10 and 5 minutes of your time, which would be unheard of somewhere that is ""authentic"". Great place!"

9n9uaTNwhCOBzIkz9p0rXQ,3,"First off, understand my 3 stars do not remotely refer to the food here, which isn't as horrific as has been described, but is not even close to A-OK. There is a lot to be desired at this buffet: paltry vegetable options, meat that's been left sitting too long, lots of brown sauce on everything. 
The shining light is the owner, Tony Nguyen, who (I kid you not) came to my table and serenaded me and my mom completely out of the blue, and actually sat down to talk. Tony is HILARIOUS. He's friends with Queen Latifah--whipped out his cell phone to prove it--writes ballads in his spare time, cracks jokes like an Asian George Lopez, funds an orphanage in Vietnam and sings kinda like Tony Bennett. I will keep going to this spot because with Tony, every meal is unforgettable."

The taste of their Coconut curry is a bit off compare to their competitors, their fresh spring roll has a lot of lettuce and less shrimps, the Pad Thai was oily (not sure what kind of oil that was in there).

The service was not the best, we waited for our order for almost 45 minutes."
UWUFFoMWiPEbp6ehTvicww,5,"Stayed at the Hilton Resort & Spa for three nights and went here (Bellamia) every day as it was very convenient - walking distance from the hotel. Linda, the owner was an absolute delight to talk to. She makes the gelato fresh every day. The crepes - ( we tried Nutella with banana ) are amazing and the gelato is delicious! We tried four  different flavors and they were all really really good! (strawberry, vanilla, hazelnut and stracciatella) She's also got crispy crepes that you can get with gelato and fruit purée.
Cappuccino was really good - perfectly prepared. Will definitely come back.
The store front is also adorable- the interior is very inviting and refreshing.

If you are in the area, this little gem is definitely worth a visit. Your taste buds will thank you :)"

5MT5m4f9rB1YjtPgtArcjg,4,"Number 1 advice: Go to the pool early. There is a line to actually get into the pool. I believe you have to be in line by 8 if you want a good spot by the pool. Be aware it gets a ton of shade because of the landscaping. 

Beds are comfy maybe too comfy, I didn't want to get up in the morning, that could have also been because of the late night at the hotel bar. The drinks were really good and the bartender was super nice! I really liked all of the staff at this hotel! 

The room was really nice and clean and even had a mini fridge which was great!

I didn't realize how big this hotel was. There are a ton of dining options and shops here. I suggest you get out and explore! It's pretty nice.

Overall my experience was pretty good! I would definitely consider staying at the Flamingo again."
TKfDPKlkgtgDCKbl86ZMOg,5,"There is something about going to an authentic little Mexican spot that passes down Grandmas recipes and you savor every bite.  Whether they have folded some paper napkins, or the server even speaks a word of English- you feel like you have been invited in as a guest and treated to a tasty dinner at often very low prices.  Now, if you are to take this wonderful experience and have admittedly some very nice tables and seating and throw fancy decorations on the wall, with mostly unauthentic servers, and have the same menu items at double or triple what it would normally cost AND your food doesn't taste near as good: that is what I experienced at Javier's.  At the end of the day I want to savor every bite.  I ordered the tampiqueña- a dish I have had before and absolutely loved at a family owned higher end place near Philadelphia, and I can't even compare the two honestly.  I tried a bite of a friends burrito and it was average at best.  Save your money if you're in the mood for Mexican in Vegas, and skip Javier's."

elqAQGsoMCzNy1loDMgNJw,2,"Had my first experience with this popular spot today.  Unfortunately, our waitress was on her third day on the job so service was poor.  She and the manager even apologized for that.  But, everyone is new to a job at least once and, as a former restaurant worker, I tend to be quite forgiving.  Whenever I go to a new ""ethnic"" restaurant I usually order one of the ""baseline dishes,"" because if these dishes are good the rest of the menu items are also usually good.   Here I did a taco and a cheese enchilada combo.  First, I couldn't get ground beef even though the waitress told me ground beef was an option, instead I got big chucks of shredded beef in the taco.  The pieces were dry and tough, so as I bit into the taco shell I ended up with a huge hunk of beef hanging out of my mouth with a little piece of shell.  Not at all good.  Most disappointing, though, was the complete lack of ""zing"" in any of the food I had.  Everything was bland, bland, bland, even the salsas served at the beginning of the meal were lackluster!  I could not taste any cilantro or jalapeno in anything!  Mexican food is supposed to have a little kick in it, but not here.  Even Taco Bell has more spice and flavor than Gecko Grill.  My wife ordered a Seafood Grande with the sauce on the side as she is extremely sensitive to any level of spicy food.  Turned out there was no sauce in this dish but the burro was covered with melted pepperjack cheese because that's too hot for her.  She sent it back and ordered a shredded beef chimi.  The staff did get that out fairly rapidly.  While my wife liked this dish, she did admit that the chucks of shredded beef were very dry and not until she poured some of the liquidy bean dip on the meat was she satisfied with it.  I tasted some of the beef and it was very dry, just as in my taco.  Also, she got a little cup of salsa fresca with her chimi but thought it was more like pico de gallo.  I tasted it and it was so oniony that I actually spit it out into my napkin.  YUK!  The onions tasted as if they had been soaking in the pico de gallo for several days.  I'm not able to recommend this place to anyone unless you want to pretend you are eating Mexican food and are satisfied with the ""gringo"" blandness that permeates their menu."

v-_VaGIIq3DgmVg1j0ZqUg,4,"Went to this place over family day weekend since all the community centers had free activities. We had lots of fun with face painting, jumping castles and Sparky the Fire Dog :) 

Otherwise I'm not sure how much this is a sports complex then just simply ice ring beside ice ring beside ice ring. Maybe I missed something and there are some sort of gyms on the lower level bit I don't think so. They did have a reception area, a little coffee bar area and then some meeting/activity rooms. So if you are into hockey this place is state of the art, I think they just had their grand opening in late 2010."
UhfWjvOgER1oRvp3cw0Qbg,4,"I love Boston Market and especially the rotisserie chicken and always have! If I could I would eat it every day, but alas, the nearest BM to us is too far. I was happy though to be in the neighbourhood and enjoy their chicken and corn muffins. 
I especially liked this location cause the staff was great! They helped me get the food to the table and then cleaned the table when we were done."

All our attendees loved them, they are total professionals and very talented at what they do, and it was an absolute pleasure to work with them. They brought their own chair, makeup kits, spotlight and banner, which made it very easy for us to set up our booth. We were easily one of the most popular booths at the conference and we attracted more leads than we ever have before. We highly recommend Miguel and his team, and we would 100% hire them again."

Crispy egg rolls filled with Ghirardelli chocolate and a ripe banana fried crispy then rolled in cinnamon and sugar. Served with three scoops of vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce. The crackle of crispy egg roll yummy

yUbSyqWGnjkI-iuVzRhrSw,4,"An absolutely beautiful campus right in downtown Montreal.  I can't speak much for the quality of the academics, however this school seems to have a pretty good reputation (however, there are currently some negative rankings on princetonreview.com).  I recently submitted a bunch of samples to their Genome Center- and they have been incredibly nice and great with everything. Furthermore, I was able to meet some of their students and biology professor while doing some research in Panama, and they all seemed very happy and had good things to say about the school.  I might be back in Montreal again later this summer, and I will definitely walk through the campus more extensively again, as I'm sure it will be even more beautiful during the summer."

I live in Texas and I was worried about planning a wedding from a different state, but with the help and assistance from Tony and the rest of the staff, it was beautiful and absolutely perfect.  The food and the cake were so delicious.  The DJ, florist, and the photographer were wonderful.  My husband and I were so pleased and so impressed and so were all of our guests.  We HIGHLY recommend Sunset Gardens!"

VGVC9r81beZwIQrcMtqjzg,3,"The Melt has a lot of hype but that is a blessing and a curse for them. Sure they have a lot of business (which I guess is the main goal) but the food is just alright. And that is the curse, they have this high-level bar to always hit. This was our first time to the Melt and instead of being blown away I regret not going to the Red Robin at the other end of the shopping center. The staff was friendly and attentive but the food was overpriced 'eh.' Our Melt Pierogi was burnt and I don't know anyone who wants a plate of the hard white base of a cabbage. My Chorizo and Potato sandwich was surprisingly lacking in taste and spice. So really I had plain meat and potatoes with cheese...for $9.  The fries are good and it is cool they load the plate up with them. Also, the atmosphere is great, the eclectic styles mix great (minus the holiday plastic lawn ornaments, that kills the great looking bar IMO). All in all, the food was not horrible and the environment is interesting. I just cannot understand the hype and doubt I will be back."
CWm101SORRe2Yq4SOJ8eeg,3,"The environment is ""5 star"" the dish I had was 3.5 (smoked pork chops).  Presentation of the dish was excellent, flavor and texture above average but not a dish that makes you go ""wow"".  Basically, paying for the environment and wine selection available."

The Szechuan is their forte, and their Chinese food is passable.
A great restaurant for authentic food and low-key ambiance. Fast and friendly service made this a very pleasing experience.
The staff is personable, but they didn't go out of their way to offer suggestions.
Worthy of repeat visits."
G4f2P4AK6hA2GU0nhOTICA,4,"Funny, I've gone to the place next door all the time, avoiding the crowd and wait. Now I understand why snooze is always busy. I ordered the bene duo (Verde and bella); so good. I'm a bene connoisseur and I absolutely loved the southwestern take, so the Verde was my fave. Everything was tasty and flavorful. Hubby got the spuds deluxe. We both cleaned our plates. The only negative I have is that the music was a little too loud, as it often is at these modern hipster joints. I like being able to have a conversation with my meal companions and I kept having to ask the hubby to repeat himself. Still I enjoyed the food, the service was excellent and it was a pleasant overall experience. Already planning to invite friends here for brunch... Soon."

Sometimes when stores are open all the time it's hard to keep clean. This location is usually pretty clean. I've never walked in and thought ""this is kind of gross."" 
-If you're hungry and don't feel like cooking, definitely get some of their chicken. 
-They've been having a sale recently on their meat ""buy 1 get 1 free."" 
-they usually have some icecream on sale too!

This location, in my experience, was identical to any Chicagoland location.  They were packed - which is typical for these guys during the lunch hours and were handling it with grace.  To some this it too slow, too chaotic, but to anyone who knows these joints, knows it's part of the price you pay for the delicious b, b, b, b, BEEF, The Gravy, the chill and Chicago dogs, the Italian combos, the chop salad THE CHOCOLATE CAKE.

If you have never been here, man you gotta go and if you know Portillo's, it's exactly what you know and love!"

verhxVOyrmt84UiaK_XreQ,4,"I haven't been back in awhile and recently I came cause my sister and her boyfriend really love the reclining seats.

If I wanted recliner seats in the past, I always went to Galaxy but even then I stopped due to the inconvenience of its location.

Overall nothing much seems to have changed, but the seats are now reserve seating and with the recliner seats, make sure you bring a jacket/blanket because it's definitely pretty cool in there. 

So if you don't want to worry about lines and seating for midnight releases/Thursday night opening showings, this is definitely a great option. Regular evening showings are $10.75 (check for student discounts) and weekend GA is $11.25.

I'll be back here for Fantastic Beasts showing."

AUW0KjCZHNEccZn0DcK2DA,1,Service was awful. Food was ok but for the price... You can definitely find better. Warning!!! Do not let the server suggest what to order... He will pick the most expensive dishes on the menu and will fail to tell you how much it is.. They should definitely warn you that your dinner for two will cost u nearly $1000.00!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE STRAIGHT UP CROOKS!!!!

We had a table reserved and honestly probably would not have had as good of a time if we didn't reserve a table... which means prob won't go back if we don't. Service was o.k. The girl working our section did not come by to check on drinks as much as she probably should have. Good crowd..they don't have a covered smoking area which sucked cause it was raining the night we went. They do have another separate little section you can chill in be away from the music a little bit. 

Place was alright, but i know it was just because the people i was with.."

g7lm0I4p5XZknWrbHWlIxA,3,"I got a veggie thali to go, and I was very happy with it. Good portion for the price, and still hot when I got home. It tasted really good, maybe if I eat in I will ask them for a bit more heat. Friendly guy at the counter who took my order. 

The only thing I have to point out is that the samosa was way undercooked. Like, doughy on the inside. The outside was crispy, filling was flavorful, but the doughiness ruined it. Maybe it was a one time thing (will update accordingly). Otherwise, impressed by this cheap meal option.

Edit: Tried the thali again, and this time the samosa was perfect. This will definitely be a too-lazy-to-cook option for me."

The tamales were excellent not as much meat as I would have hoped for, but the moistness and flavor of the masa was on point. And the Menudo were do I start. I like my Menudo sin grano. And they accommodated me. Even asked if I wanted a pata Oooohhhhh it was delicious. This was Definitely worth the drive. And we will definitely be back. Great service too.:)"
zVhC5T6-laQF1Kb2jjKZiA,2,"Parking at this airport is something out of a paradox.  From the outside it looks like this place has more parking than actual space for the airplanes.  However, trying to park here to fly out for a business or leisure trip has been something out of a time vortex where nothing makes any sense.  The signs are not set up to streamline people coming to this airport to park and fly out.  I was almost late for a business flight since I was so confused on where to park and where to go.  Inside has a decent amount of restaurants and to my surprise designer shops.  More to my surprise is how these shops afford to stay open since most of their items for sale is beyond what anyone would pay for and there is never anyone in there.  Unsolved mysteries indeed."

There breakfast is very hearty. The portions are large enough that you do not walk away hungry. You may even take some home with you.

The Italian bread/toast is great. I am speculating that it is the same bread Primantis uses for their famous sandwiches.

The orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes amazing."
TTfrlKYHMLLynnHBH1ybLA,5,"I had a custom hockey jersey framed and both of the guys I worked with were extremely helpful. The jersey came at high stakes as it was a jersey gifted to the CEO of my company and he wanted it framed. The guys were very helpful and understanding that this needed to be PERFECT. 

Allen called me half-way through the process to see exactly how I wanted to move forward because our original layout didn't end up working. He sent me pictures of my options so I didn't have to make the drive all the way there, which was nice. 

It did take a while to get the jersey framed though, but it was the holidays so I'm sure that played a factor. I didn't have a time crunch so it wasn't a big deal. 

I'm so happy I chose these guys rather than any of the other frame companies I looked into originally."

RhoG38X0jr43vKWWmAtPpg,5,"What a great experience!

Before selecting a storage facility we looked around and compared prices, as storage costs are not an afterthought anymore. Aside from a reasonable price, we wanted a secure, clean and climate controlled space. We found all of that and more at 
San Tan Self Storage in Chandler! This facility is meticulously kept, well run, fairly priced and highly secure. 

As an added bonus, Chris and Patrick, the management team, are wonderful! They are very friendly, easy to work with, have excellent communication skills and are highly professional. 

You cannot go wrong with San Tan Self Storage of Chandler- it's a 10+."
c85nAZ3SvASW8mZBLoVkVA,4,Cue Club has become a Mill Avenue staple in recent years. Every notable Tempe establishment has its own respective day in which it is best to attend. For Cue Club that day is without a doubt Sunday. The seemingly endless long islands and cheap drinks on Sunday make for an excuse to get absolutely plastered. They have pool tables and a few bar games in the back so you're not forced to converse with the people you came with. It is a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon and forget the responsibilities that come with the week ahead.
eUexYG_3MtEKOxod7jbJnA,4,"It took a long time for me to write a review on this Value Village, because I needed to visit it a lot to get a better understanding.

My association with the relocated Dixie/Dundas Value Village began in January 2017, when I was invited to a pre-opening event because of my status as a Club Card member. It was a bit of a surprise walking in for the first time - the place was absolutely sprawling. From what I gathered at the time, this location is twice as big as the previous site across the street near the Talize.

The whole corner block has quickly turned into a hub for thrift stores - this site is now directly across the street from the Salvation Army and Talize (both of which I've spoken about in previous reviews). After visiting this Value Village frequently for the past three months, I'm confident in saying that this is now my new favorite in the city.

(As an aside, for those complaining about the lack of finds - this store was, and will continue to be, a prime target for resellers. At the pre-opening event, I watched a man run to the records section and immediately start hoarding a stack of LPs, most likely destined for eBay. It's the nature of the beast.)

The store is a bit overwhelming. Not only are there racks upon racks of clothing, but the specialty sections are surprisingly well-curated. I always make a beeline for the books whenever I come in, and I've been consistently surprised by the quality and selection of books. A thrift store is only as good as the donations it gets, and I've been impressed with the amount of content they get in. The vintage/collectible books section consistently has stuff that looks either brand-new or being sold at a significant loss (i.e. Folio Society books, signed books, Penguin collectible titles). The clothing itself is another high point - I've found everything from Brooks Brothers to Hugo Boss suits here, and a dizzying amount of shoes, jeans and other accessories.

Of course, the knick-knack section runs into the same problem as any other thrift store. Picked over and filled with broken or unusable items. To their credit, though, I almost always see employees restocking whenever I visit. I'm a bit more comfortable paying higher prices for thrifted goods when I know the selection is well-maintained and highly curated.

This Value Village has quickly turned into one of my favorite spots in the city to go thrifting at, and it's one I plan on visiting frequently for a long time to come.

Well worth checking out."

But I have fine, stick straight hair and have had trouble before with stylists wanting to do tons of layers or try other ideas - never ends well. From the first time I saw Lorraine she knew the exact style that worked for my hair and I was so happy with it! I've been going back for a few years now and highly recommend her and this salon."

U3h6RsF_fk_jcPPQthMVuw,3,Ok normally I would give this place 5 stars. Tonight is not one of them. The WORST SERVICE EVER! 4 tables in the bar. That's it. So when it took us 10 mins at least to just get water. 5 mins later a menu. After 15 mins the beer is still sitting at the bar. Got up to get them ourselves the bartender says relax sit down we are really busy. Again 4 tables. I believe 30 mins was plenty of time to relax. Didn't even bother to order food just paid the tab and left. On a side note the table next to us had to bang their silverware on the table just to get their water. Poor customer service all the way around. And no didn't even feel bad for telling the bartender he was a real POS. Kudos however to the kind man that made sure we had our chips and salsa. He was the best part of the experience. Hence the only deserving star.

I had the whiting platter with baked sweet potato and a side of fries. I didn't like the kind of fries that they serve, I love French fries especially the crinkle cut but there is one particular kind of FF's that I don't like and they just so happen to serve them. Another thing I didn't like was that the fish still had the skin on  it, not too much of a big deal cause I ate it but I prefer my fish without it. I do like the face that they give u the option of a regular baked potato or sweet potato.  My server was very nice but she was running around like she had a lot of tables and that place wasn't that busy considering it was lunch time. She forgot my straws for my drinks and my extra napkins until I was able to get her attention again. Other than that this place was look. Would I come back? Maybe but there are some other nice restaurants in the area."

This place is in our neighborhood, so we went there twice before writing it off the list. The laffas were tasteless and dry, the dips were of the same quality as prepackaged food at Longo's, yet the place is always packed with people...? I think Hanna's Shawarma is much better than this place, it is marginally more expensive but the food certainly tastes better."

I have stopped in for lunch a few times during my work day, and haven't been disappointed by the big tastes and big portions they offer. I typically save half of my sandwich for the next day; their sandwiches are huge and loaded with ingredients. This makes up for the average sandwich cost of $8-10, making it into two $4-5 lunches for those without a gigantic appetite."

Awv6c9WW2msbCcKjBSIfrQ,3,"The one thing they stand out for is portion. Their premade salads that are laid out on the counters are pretty popular. You point to the one you like (mixed greens with salmon or shredded chicken or other meat toppings or fruit & nut) and pick the dressing you want. If you don't like the ones they premade, you can order from their menu. They also have panini and other non salad items, which I haven't tried. 
You don't know the price of the premade salads until you get to the cash. Salads range $9-11 ish. You can help yourself to croutons, sunflower seeds and one more thing (I forgot) for your salad at the cash register. I have only tried their premade salads. They are huge and you actually feel full for the rest of the day.
The people are curt; don't expect smiley greetings. Also, their nuts in one of the salads tasted and smelled really, really old. Other than that, a reasonably priced healthy option in that world."
ngRiV0DU2j69XQys8gREJw,4,"Had a great experience here at Hibachi. The food and service was good, the price is okay but it's definitely worth it if you go every so often for that experience.

Overall it was a really nice experience."

I don't have that parent anxiety leaving her at Bridges as I have had with other care providers. She is growing and learning so much. She has made great friends and she adores her teachers. She asks on school breaks when she can go back to Ms Nikki's class. I appreciate the willingness to help attitude of the support staff in the front office. All of the teachers and the assistants truly care about my child and her well being. Bridges is a great place to learn.

These folks are not just your typical landscapers they are actual real arborists.   You can tell they specialize in tree removal. They were very safe while working all machines. They definitely delivered extraordinary customer service and I will pass along their info to anyone in need."

I must preface: I suggest ordering multiple things and sharing, therefore you get to taste more menu options!

CORN SOUP: wow! The flavors literally transform in your mouth from sweet roasted corn to zesty spice. 

Goat cheese fondido: A MUST TRY!!! Literally the best thing I've ever eaten. Burnt cheese on top, and soft gooey cheese on the inside. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, you need to reevaluate your life priorities. 

Spicy chicken hash: my personal least favorite of what we got, but still incredible and flavorful. The egg was poached to absolute perfection. 

Bread basket: really good but DO NOT FILL UP ON THIS."
FQa4IJ94nqMUJ5uPWIGVTA,2,"Not sure how this place is for dinner, but for lunch it is more cafeteria than anything else.  Food is not served to you at lunch.  You have to get up and get it yourself even if you are paying almost $30 for a prime rib!"

k3JbSxbM09zGn6Mwbq3jQA,4,"Let me set the scene, Date night,  we were the first table sat at 5pm.  I went by at 11am to pick out a table, drop the rose and give instructions for how I would like the table prepared.     EPIC FAIL!  

We were sat at the wrong table, the rose was on a table I did not pick, the candle was not lit.   and we were sat against the windows where the sun was in our eyes so then we had to switch seats and place our backs to the windows.   Now a good start but lets move on..   

Food was spectacular,   I highly recommend the truffle ravioli. (I almost licked the plate)   The server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable on the food.  I hate that I cant remember his name to give him credit.   ( upstairs july 27th shaved head )

Overall excellent experience except for the fact that I took the effort to come in and pick out a table away from the windows so the sunlight would not be in our eyes and that I gave fairly specific instructions as to how I wanted the rose on the table and candle lit as we sat.    

Next time I will have the host repeat the instructions. 

--side note-- it was restaurant week, and there were only 4 tables for me to choose from when I showed up at 11am,  I chose the best out of the 4 and a five pm seating time so we could make it to the theater at 730pm.   There were only 6 tables sat by the time we left at 645 700.    My point,  we should have had our pick of the litter for tables."

rcr6PEQn8xwj6Eh51P2Qyg,5,"Worth every penny, every minute, every second. Way more interesting and informative than you can imagine. Book a tour in advance, this is the only way you can visit the museum. You can book student tickets online just be sure to bring your student ID with you when you visit. Our tour guide was so nice, I have her to thank for leading us to the Container Park which is located on Fremont and 7th, a five minute walk from the casino madness also on Fremont and 4th. 

Las Vegas is full of history, most of it has been forgotten due to old hotels being taken down and rebuild by new owners and developers. The folks at Neon Museum do their best in getting their hands on as many Neon signs as possible in hopes to preserve them and hopefully to restore them back to life. You'll learn all this and a lot more if you visit the Neon Museum and go on the tour. The one thing I wish was that they'll let you take photos after or before the tour, but because there are so many tours one after another they don't let you. Super clean and cute facility. 

Nevada recognizes the Neone Museum's efforts in preserving Las Vegas's history and now has their back and helps them out every way that they can. One way they help out is by renting them their land for $1 a year so they can use the money from ticketing, the gift shop, and donations towards running the museum and preserving these marvelous pieces of art. The passion and love from the entire staff is touching, you just know you're visiting a place that is important to the state. There were more locals than tourists on our tour, which tells me it has more cultural significance than tourism... you can also rent out a private lot in the back for weddings or private events. 

Tickets are extremely reasonably priced. $18 for adults and $12 for students. Parking is free. It's a private non profit.

Tips: We went on a day time tour at 3pm, we kind of wish we had booked it a little later around 4pm due to the heat. There are umbrellas they will loan you for free for your tour, you leave your ID with them in exchange. Family friendly. Only a few of the signs work at night, the photos come out better during the day time. Walk in is ok, but they recommend booking in advance, depending on how booked the tours are you could walk in and hop on a tour or they might book you for the following day.  If you want to expand your neon experience visit Fremont and be sure to goto the Container Store, The Writers Block, and check out the Downtown Podcast."

We were seated promptly and I ordered the appetizer combo while my husband ordered the fish and chips with a Moscow mule. The drink was well made and we felt satisfied with both of our dishes. We sat right inside the entrance and enjoyed looking out to see folks walking around."
fwba5PN_Ze7ild23lC19-g,4,This place wasnt exactly one of those WOW ITS SO NICE resturants. First impression was that it was some dingy little place but i decided to go in since it was really chilly outside. The decor was eclectic but warm and pleasant. I ordered a linguini and that was probably one of the best pastas ive ever had! i was really surprised. Like the reviews below the bathroom is in a really wierd location but it added some charm to this tiny resturant.
X-IbRDC97nLAMkmoWgeLVQ,4,"Great service even before closing. We ate outside. The food was great. For appetizer had the thai crab cake. It was very good. Husband had the coffee to drink and said it was the best he had ever had. I had their chicken and he had their scallops and shrimp. The scallops were a bit rubbery, but everything else taste great. Great for a romantic dinner or a business meeting (there was a meeting going on beside us)."

PUWTJL-I_HCftgnn9S-C5w,5,My husband and I visited the Glendale store on 6-6-13 for our first pair of running shoes and we were very impressed with this store!! We were immediately greeted by Micaela. She was extremely nice patient and very thorough as we asked a 101 ?? I learned so much from her. When it came time to try on shoes she was very patient with us as we must have tried on 10 pairs of shoes lol :) I never felt pressured  to buy anything which felt nice :) when we finally selected our shoes and were told the prices of them both she even told me she didn't bring out the top of the line shoes (most expensive) cuz she must have got my vibe that I was anxious about spending $100 + on a pair of running shoes and that made me like our experience even more. She wasnt trying to put me in the most expensive shoe knowing it can be overwhelming to newbies like us :) both my husbands and I's shoes were both $90 :) when we were leaving they invited us to on their group runs and made us feel welcomed. I could go on forever about how much I loved my very first running shoes purchase!! I would recommended this store to everyone!! ~Jennifer Foskette~ Goodyear Az

My friend and I went here for lunch one day and he ordered a turkey and I ordered just a plain sesame bagel. I had stopped by Fry's and bought some vegan cream cheese before going here so I was able to smear some of that on. The bagel itself was really good! 

The staff working was super friendly and helpful too. I liked how they had a wide variety of drinks from fountain drinks to coffee and tea to bottled beverages in a cooler."

First things first, the place looks awesome. Second, the beer selection is fantastic for not being a normal place you would get beer. Lastly, but not least, the food is delicious. My wife and I shared the Chillax Stack with 50/50 waffle fries. It was so good. It is like all the comfort food you want, except you don't feel like crap after you eat it. Everything on thew menu looks awesome and I cant wait to try all of the other stacks. The place is a must!"

They let me take my time looking at samples and helped me pick out different products to bring home. They also explained the pros and cons of all the products.

The installers worked fast! Rain or shine, they came to the house and put in a full day's work. We had some difficult corners to manage and they did an amazing job. I even saw them cut out some pieces they weren't happy with and recut pieces til they got it perfect.

Located in the Aria near a gajillion other restaurants, this place looks like just a ""whatever"" place, but NOOOOOOO! SO GOOD. Sit at the bar because they have a special happy hour-ish menu from 11:30 - 5pm everyday!

Ordered:
x BANG-BANG SHRIMP (rock shrimp | iceberg lettuce | rosemary ranch) - Refreshing dish and beautiful presentation! Crunchy, a little sweet AND a lottle spicy :)
x BLACK RICE (fresh calamari | lobster | saffron | squid ink) - MUST ORDER!!!! This dish was SOOO GOOD! Rice was cooked perfectly and the moose thingie mixed with everything made it 100x better. Seriously, order this or I'm blocking you for life!
x STEAMED MUSSELS (shallots and garlic | brandy | natural jus) - flavorful mussels with generous portions. I thought it was a little under cooked, but thought it was still delicious.
x LOBSTER EMPANADAS (puff pastry | lobster | cheese) - probably my least favorite thing, but I'm not really a fan of fried stuff to begin with so I'm biased. The boo wanted it so got it. Nice kick to each bite and good flavors.

$7 wines & $5 sangrias!!

I will 110% be back here again for the bar menu. Quickly became one of my favorite places in Vegas :0) SUPER AFFORDABLE TOO!"

Besides the regular groceries I get from there, I also get the sandwiches, packaged foods, sushi, and etc... that they make over there.  I don't think I've seen so many types of healthier cereals in a place before.  I like the ""make your salad"" option they have there.  You can even eat inside or outside of the store, but I'd suggest inside especially in this Vegas heat."

0H9vIqz5JCIg7JeFNFQOww,4,"Standalone Starbucks in Cornelius

Cornelius has two Starbucks and some poeple get them confused.  This is the one on the corner of W. Catawba and One Norman Blvd. The other is inside the Harris Teeter off of Jetton Rd.

I stop occasionally for a quick cup of coffee in the morning as I go to work since I drive right by it.  I love Starbucks Coffee and it is always fresh.  

I generally don't have much time because road construction has made me late a couple of times but service is such that I can park, get out of my car, go inside order and be back on the road in less than 5 minutes.  Takes longer than that to go through some of the local drive through.

Service has always been great and the product is outstanding."
qnCILAp9eBzgg28VzztT8g,3,"The only reason I go here is they give me a 2-1 every month and then a free food coupon every once in a while.  To make up for all the free food they charge ways to much for what they serve.  You think when you get a coupon for $20 that your going to get a great meal for two, but that is just a sandwich.  I ""won"" a $50 voucher from one of there contests, I was able to get 2 drinks, a daily special and an upgraded burger and 2 deserts.  The food is the chefs take on things and every time I get something new there is a ""what is this"" moment.  Like we got a house salad, but it was a lot of greens and not iceberg, so it didn't get eaten.  It seems every time I've been here (5 times) that someone gets something that doesn't get eaten or sent back because it is so different then what was expected.  Even with a 2-1 is seems to be a questionable value."
VoEl2jlLFgwNUQYV0VzmQA,4,"I have wanted to play this course for a while seeing all the photos and buzz about this course. 

It has all the famous golf holes from Scotland.  First off the when I drove up to the gated course it gave me impression of a private course.  The service was impressive and the guys work quick to get me teed up without delay.   Again on par with a country club. 

The course is in great shape and with no houses or building visible from the courses you almost forget your in Las Vegas.   Fairways are rolling with deep bunkers strategically located to catch missed shots.  However if you look at the course map you can get around these with well placed shots.  The sides of the fairways are hilly and have that long grass as hazards.  The fairways are pretty wide open so making it onto the short grass is very possible for most of the round.   However the rolling hills throughout course adds challenge to the middle of the fairway shot.  But it's straight forward traditional golf which I like best!  

The greens where fast, fast and true!   They broke like they should and required the right touch. Like the fairways they also had some ups and downs you had read before making your putts. 

All in all a very fun golf course and one I would play again on a future trip to Vegas.  If you played a lot of desert courses and want to try something different this is the ticket.   And it's a great way to get a taste of the Scotland experience."
MOkaECWMWvJy0kYQlFsdAA,1,"Awful experience. Came here for my sister's birthday. Good thing women were free, but damn it would suck to be a guy. My husband ended up paying $125 at the door. First dj was awful & played music that were slow and un-danceable at the beginning. A coke & rum cost a freaking $16 and it wasn't even a tall glass!! Dance floor was too packed and it took me 15 minutes just to leave it. I think several fire codes were violated that night. Main dj (Hardwell) didn't come on until 1:30 pm, at which time it's impossible to even move in the dance floor. Ridiculous prices. Totally not worth it. Hakkasan was a total dud & disappointment. Would not recommend unless you're planning to purchase one of their even more expensive table service."

I'm being generous with my 1 stars: 1 star for the fresh bread, 2nd star for the soup. 0.5 stars for the appetizers ( uneven hummus, ok baba ghanouj, yogurt dip, some eggplant salad as they were out of fattoush & tabbouleh). These appetizers come with the $30 combo chicken & meat plate served on a bed of rice. 0 stars for the olive oil ( looks mixed  with other oils). -2 stars ( that's negative 2) for the dry over cooked unseasoned meat & chicken.

oYJLsjCNSts_a0I1UTaneQ,1,"Ehhhhh.

This was my second time at The Ivy. My first time was over a year ago for dinner, and it was totally fine. I thought the food was okay and the drinks and ambience were super cute. As a result, I suggested it for a girls brunch.

We met up for brunch today; there were about 10 of us and other than that, the place was dead. There was just an odd, empty vibe to the place, cute decor was still there, but it looked kind of dirty/disheveled. 

They were out of tons of stuff, drinks were slow to be refilled, empty plates left on the table for a long time, etc. it was just odd-- like you could see leftover Christmas paper on your way back to the bathroom, the bathrooms weren't particularly clean,  my friend got a salad without dressing and it ended up being because they were out of salad dressing, but no preemptive attempt was made to correct it before she complained. Whenever we attempted to voice a minor concern, the waiter indicated that it was all due to poor management?

Sometimes service is slow with a big group, but this went beyond that. It was very, very odd.

I want to love this place, it's cute and the food was good, but this trip left A LOT to be desired, sadly."
L9r4VjMyp_dVjb4RlBTckg,3,"After 3 years and 8 months in braces I would have to give a good review to Dr. Cooper and his staff. I originally started with Dr. Woodard but after the second year, he retired and sold his practice to the fast talking, quick moving Dr. Cooper. My original prognosis was for 2 to 2 1/2 years. I opted for clear ceramic and paid $500 extra. Well worth the cost for a slightly less noticeable mouth. Wait times in the office ranged from just a couple minutes to over an hour based on staffing. The office always seems unstaffed and everyone over worked. Scheduling appointments was easy in person and on the phone but rescheduling could mean a delay of a month! Kudos to Tammy and Becky. 
When I asked Dr. Cooper why my treatment was taking so long, he explained he wanted the outcome perfect and didn't want to take me out of my braces until it looked right. I appreciated that we was interested in my smile and now debonding me too early just to get another patient. Overall, I am happy with the results and would do it again but not for nearly 4 years"

GcOKK1H88oVvXfcIIVjdbQ,4,"This hotel doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it's fantastic.  The rooms are large and spotlessly clean.  I stayed in a whirlpool suite which had a huge tub and a massive flat screen TV.  The bed was comfortable and the hotel was very quiet.  The only disadvantage was that the hotel is located in an industrial area, but there were a couple of nearby restaurants (including one that delivered) and it's only a short drive from the strip.  The next morning, the shuttle got me to the airport in less than 15 minutes.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a luxurious room in a quiet hotel."

IenKQPmJRfAuz94mlSEp1A,2,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars because it is still definitely a nice hotel and I'd give it 4 stars if it were just presenting itself as a nice place to stay, but the general attitude of the staff and the large number of small inconveniences are really inexcusable in a place that's trying to sell itself as a luxury hotel.  Overall conclusion: I wouldn't pay that price if I just want a nice place to stay, and if I want a luxury hotel I expect more knowledgeable and helpful staff, and a greater attention to detail. So, although overall I had a mostly pleasant time I don't expect to be back.

Details of my stay: I'd booked the junior suite but was offered a good deal on an upgrade to the full suite, which I did since the bathroom in the junior was really not that luxurious looking or feeling. 

Unfortunately the light-blocking curtains in the bedroom wouldn't close all the way. Since I didn't discover this till I fell into bed about 2am I didn't realize how bright it would be. At 6am I was awake and couldn't get back to sleep, so I was exhausted the next day and already regretting the upgrade.  At breakfast I asked the front desk to fix the curtains but by evening they still had not. I couldn't find anybody at the spa any time I stopped by, and I left a voicemail which was never returned. I had to follow up on both and discovered the spa had tried to call back but the voicemail had never been set up for my room so they could not, so the only time left free by then was in the middle of dinner time, not the next morning when I had wanted. The phone in the master bedroom was also completely broken and maintenance had to replace it. And extra 3 bathrobes were confusingly misdelivered to our room, so someone else must have been annoyed.

The ""spa"" is a single room off the fitness equipment area, with one bed and one chair for manicure/pedicures, plus a sauna/steam room in the changing room. One single person staffs it (not a hotel employee, I think; seemed like an external contractor) which explains why there's never anybody at the main desk.  Having just the one person and one bed/chair meant that we two people had to sit and wait for each other half an hour at a time which had not been made at all clear until we got there, which was annoying. I ended up canceling my pedicure just so we could be done in time to eat dinner before 10pm.

The suite was nice, but gave the feeling that hotel management hasn't actually tried STAYING in the rooms.  Little things were just slightly lacking, like the bathrooms having no hooks to hang a bathrobe on and no place to put a towel while in the shower, and the TV size being tiny. Vast empty rooms alone do not equal luxury; it's the conveniences and the attention to detail that makes the difference.

Breakfast was passable but what I'd expect from an airport hotel, not what I'd expect in a hotel that bills itself as a luxury location. The worst problem was that I'd asked at the front desk the day before if they had gluten free options for breakfast and the lady there had absolutely no idea, and the breakfast waitress said they had nothing and couldn't do anything.  Very abrupt and unhelpful. This diet is not rare these days, and the total lack of knowledge of the staff and unhelpful attitude about it were very disappointing.

So, not to be totally negative, the beds were very comfortable, the heating/cooling in the room worked well, and the free wifi decently stable. The doormen were helpful, the location is convenient about 4 blocks walk from the Eaton Center, and the downstairs pool and hot tub look beautiful and were enjoyable (it was a bit too cold for us to try the roof hot tubs).  The hotel IS well kept up and looks luxurious although perhaps a bit past its prime.

I requested a refund on the first night's upgrade fee given all the issues, but it was refused in a rambling voicemail.

Off the top of my head I'd suggest the following improvements:
- serious front desk staff training program
- expand dietary options; charge extra to cover the cost if needed, but offer it
- improve the breakfast. Fresher pastries & food. If budget is tight consider adding an omelette/crepe station off to the side for a $5 upgrade. For god's sake stop hiding the tea pots!
- the spa is small and limited. You cannot hide this so stop trying. If people need to plan to have only 1 person in the spa at once then let them plan in advance for that. Make it clear in the hotel information and include the full spa information in each room with the other information, instead of having the spa desk always unattended and needing to ask for the brochure at the front desk 
- add hooks and more towel rails to the bathrooms
- offer fuzzy slippers as well as bathrobes in the suites
- upgrade the TV size in living room
- train housekeeping staff to report things like curtains that will not close, and check phone and appliances daily
- if the spa is unable to leave voicemail, they should alert front desk to fix that"
bBdXU8di6m5uGdr9fL64Fg,5,"One of my favourite places to go for a casual drink with friends or to go for a first date!

I've had several separate first dates here and the low-key atmosphere definitely helps get past the awkward first meeting. Most people are super surprised to see such a great bar on Yonge st these days, so it's a real stand out place if you're a fan of places like Bellwoods Brewery. As with Bellwoods, BarVolo brews a lot of their own beers and has an ever-changing menu which is both a good and bad thing. I've had a couple great beers here that I haven't been able to find again because they're always updating the beer list. Sometimes, it's hard to find a beer you like that suits your budget because there are so many options. I'm no beer aficionado but everything I've had there is pretty decent, and the servers are very knowledgeable and can recommend a good drink for you depending on your tastes.

The food is pretty good and it's fun to share the little plates with a date or friends. The charcuterie is decent and is always changing too, depending on what's fresh and available. It's kind of a small place with communal tables as well as small private tables. In the summer, there's more seating on the patio which can alleviate wait times, but in the winter, I've had to wait up to 30 minutes to get seated. But the wait time is usually quite quick -- quicker than you expect. There's also a more casual ""mingling"" area on the upper level by the bar where you can stand while you drink and wait for a table to become available, so it never seems like too long a wait, and the servers are quite good about notifying you in a timely manner.

Really love this place, love that it's away from the predictable areas like Parkdale or Queen west. Will definitely be back."
3-A2Fmo6ZMSJV0Isc-kmQQ,4,"Our complaints are minor-- we wish that in the renovated apartments, they would replace the old fixtures in the closets instead of just putting another layer of paint over them, as well as the doors and baseboards. It's like, our apartment looks expensive and cheap all at the same time (because the paint continuously chips off the doors and what not).

We also do not like that we have to pay for valet trash. $360 a year for a company to throw our trash out is a bit of a waste to us since we don't live far from the trash area. Especially since when we do put our trash out, they don't always take it all (which baffles me. Why am I paying for them to take only most of my trash?).

Other than that, I'd say we like Sardis Place quite a bit. It seems like the new management is really trying to make this place more homey and spiffy. The employees have always been really great to us, and my boyfriend and I are actually a little confused by the other reviews saying that the employees aren't great.

The 2 Bedroom, 2 Bathroom has Washer/Dryer in unit, granite countertops, dishwasher, stove, microwave, fridge. One room has a completely private bathroom, the other has access from the room and from the living area. We have queen beds in our rooms, they fit very comfortably, a king would also fit. My only complaint about the rooms is that there is no fan (in the room or bathrooms) and no overhead light. 

I am a big fan of the kitchen. For an apartment, it has a pretty decent amount of storage. I cook a LOT, so I have a lot of stuff to cook with. I only have 1.5 boxes of kitchen stuff that wouldn't fit (which is amazing to me since I have 17 different pots and pans). 

As far as we've seen, the community has a pool, dog park, and a lot of run around area for kids to play. Our neighbors mostly keep to themselves, and we never see anyone, but it could also be that we work weird hours.

If I think of more, I will keep adding. I hope this helps!"
-BtJZz1lCxnxbmrGZ9-NFA,3,Orange juice was excellent.  Food bland.  Big puffy scrambled eggs that needed salt.  Left most on my plate.  I don't get it.
wmOgNkz3tdypwJ9a2WzQbA,2,"First impressions of this place is nice decor and plenty space for small groups. The menu has a good selection from sharable appetizers to entrees, dessert and priced accordingly. I ordered a basil chicken and pork belly plate with milk tea and sad to say I'm disappointed. There was nothing flavorful or special about the basil chicken and pork belly plate. The portion was good tho. Now I'm crazy about boba and this was the most disappointing. The tea was so bitter I couldn't even sip anymore then twice before I needed to have it remade not to mention they really shouldn't charge for boba if they practically give you nothing. The boba was mushy and overcooked as well. Next time I will go elsewhere for my boba fix. The service was decent and the girls were nice tho. Won't be returning anytime soon."
C3MUPh0wIOt_mICDMwQLKQ,5,"I've been taking my dogs here for 2 years. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. There's been times when my husband and I had to take our dogs in for emergency situations like bee sting, allergies or dog fights and if their office hrs are open they alway make an attempt to get us in. They are honest sand you can tell they care about the pets they treat."
Z08MAD_puZDrHJYup6txEw,2,I have been here many times and my feeling is the quality of the food here is going down day by day. Sorry to say that but it's true.
GAnFhhV2iWNDp3dPrEWQ9g,3,"Awesome flavors, but the toppings are very whatever. Their saving grace is that they have the cute waffle chips. 

And wow! Pleasantly surprised with their coffee. I wasn't expecting much since it's not a dedicated cafe, but wow, their coffee is insanely strong (you can choose between regular and strong-- I chose strong). Bitter, of course, but wonderful. Finally, something to knock out the weakling brews nearby.

The only bubble tea made with fruit instead of a fruit and powder mix is lychee, which is yummy but I wish more of the drinks were made with 100% fruit.  Contrary to another reviewer, I got a lot of tapioca IMO. I don't think there's a *great* place for bubble tea in Champaign, but Coco is good. You can ask to look at their ingredients list, and let me save you the surprise, it is crap. A huge amount of sugar too. 

The only true downsides are that the interior design is bad and some kid thought it'd be funny to sneeze all over the machines and the staff did nothing about it. The design is not the worst I've seen... but it's pretty ugly and pretty obvious that they didn't hire a good designer. It's the floor... And the kinds of light fixtures they have... Especially that awful LED tree... And how the counter and the area behind the counter look. The place doesn't look put together. There's no flow-- only a big box with an ascetic layout and poor decor. You can see what the big end goal was... And it wasn't reached. When I think of how Coco looks, I think of the yellow ""you tried"" star meme. They tried. But the ambience doesn't detract from the food."
0hGxgPN3mFq2YYxL-1T-rg,4,"An excellent brunch spot in Lawrenceville. My friend and I came around 10:30 on a Sunday. Definitely use the NoWait app or be prepared to wait 45 minutes to an hour. We luckily used the app and arrived when our table was ready. I ordered a chai latte and the eggplant eggs benedict and my friend had the challah french toast with brie and fig jam. 

As others have noted, my main issue with Coca Cafe was not the food but the service. My waiter had forgotten about my chai latte and brought it out over a half hour after I ordered. Our food came after about 45 minutes of waiting. 

Luckily, the food was delicious. My eggplant eggs benedict was perfect. The eggplant was not too thick and nice and crispy. Their lemon basil hollandaise sauce was also the perfect complement. The potatoes could have used a bit more seasoning. My friend also enjoyed her french toast. 

Overall, the quality of the food was fantastic. The reason for the four stars is the amount of waiting. If they could get their food out just a bit faster, maybe they would not have such long wait times. As I thoroughly enjoyed my eggs benny, I look forward to coming back on a less crowded day."

I worked closely with Kyle Simmons, and I highly recommend him to anyone looking to sell or buy their next home.  He is extremely knowledgeable and knows the community and stats really well i was beyond impressed!  Not only did my home close faster than I expected, but I got more money than I had planned on.  I will be using him for all my future purchases.  Having worked with an agent for my first home I now know the level of service, honesty and attention he provides."

At the end of the night, however, realized that PF Changs is way better. Spring Rolls has very average food which was too pricey for the quality. Service was a disappointment. Very bored looking staff who tended to disappear on us quite often."

8bRMAwZMKBm0nElMQn8-6w,4,"Good Chinese food.  Wonton soup has shrimp and pork and chicken with vegetables in s clear broth with nice size dumplings.  The House Special Chicken is very good!! Sweet & Spicy white meat chicken pieces ($1.00 extra for white meat chicken), with steamed broccoli.  Asked them to put sauce in container of ordering for delivery so chicken does not get soggy.  The Walnut Shrimp is very good also.  The shrimp were nice sized, 21-26 ct., Sz., very nice and very good shrimp, with nice brown sauce and vegetables.  But, would not recommend the Shrimp Egg Foo Young.  The patties looked pre-made and sauce or gravy had the shrimp in it instead being in the patties? Otherwise, definitely one of our Favorite Chinese to go or delivery that is close by. Thank U for always being patient when placing order! Very patient because of so many different sauces, chow mein noodles, hot mustard and sweet & sour sauce that's fresh not in packets which they will Do!"
fAaIdY9d8UW_YmqMU72mqQ,1,"This could have been one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.  Went there with a few other people.  For appetizers we had the potatoes and the sun chokes.  Both were ok.  I was not very hungry so I ordered the gem salad with Caesar dressing.  It was inedible.  It was drowning in cheese and dressing that had too much garlic.  I also ordered the brocolini which was barely edible.  

Others ordered the pork chop and steelhead.  They all seemed to have enjoyed their meals.  This is the first time I've ever had a salad that I would categorize as inedible.  There were also very few things on the menu that were appealing.  Other than hotel guests, I cant imagine anyone else coming here."

36_7AVK7YJFryB1O5dm6pQ,4,"It was overall a good experience for a birthday party for my 7 year old and his buddies from school. 

For about $12 a head (adults and kids) we had enough pizza and drinks for everyone, and even wings and a couple of pitchers of beer for the grown-ups. The price even included ice cream, which went well with the cake I brought. Go for the extra token deal (100 for $20). It's hard to have too many tokens in a situation like this.

Food quality is about what you'd expect in an arcade that sells pizza. Nothing to complain about, really.

This location sometimes gets a few bad mentions for the clientele. We were there mid-afternoon on a Saturday and anyone used to a diverse central-city crowd wouldn't have been put off by any customer in attendance. Service was pleasant and and well-experienced. Our server knew how to stage things sequentially, which was appreciated.

About the only downside is parking. You might need to park between the pad which houses the place and the remnants of Tower Plaza instead of directly in front. Not a big deal."
If7VgnTH3sDADzu4iwRe2g,4,Food is always good. Egg rolls are nice crisp and sauces for varying dishes are always very good. Nice clean atmosphere and friendly staff very polite and accommodating .

X8c_c38ZRN6GFZUutXpvhA,4,"This place is tinyyyyyy, I drove right by the first time. The building looks like a little old fashioned walk up ice cream place (kinda like the original Honey Hut in Brooklyn Heights.) and it's sandwiched between an old house and a car lot. There is no inside seating but when the weather is nice they have patio chairs. It's walk up and DRIVE THRU!!! 

The ladies were super nice and very helpful! They have a daily feature menu as well as a standard menu, the options are a little limited but I would expect that from this type of establishment, that being said, it isn't lacking in any type of way if you're into this kind of fare. 

If you're into health foods, ""acai"" style bowls and good soups, this is the spot for you! Support your local business!!!"
MXOQu1wCZOziKxa4Bz2Ihg,3,"I'm going to keep this short like my visit to speed Vegas. I went online to make reservations, it showed the Mercedes AMG GT S as available for the whole day as it offers days and times, it was also a Sunday so I drove to Speed Vegas expecting it to be available. Showed up and was told the Mercedes AMG GT S was not available it was in for repairs. The staff was nice, the place was clean, but there wasn't anything before making the drive all the way out there to say that the car was unavailable. I even got an email later that day that offered me a drive in the GT S. So needless to say, I was a little more than disappointed I would have figured for the price and stuff there may have been 2 so when 1 is down you can still go out. I can't knock the experience and I personally own a BMW Z4 so the drive out there was unnecessary but fun. Anyways maybe next year when I go back out to Vegas it'll be available and I'll be able give the experience a better review."
R25MNPjjEQpNagVd9KFPOQ,5,"As good as it gets! I sent a request asking for help/quote with my garbage disposal via Yelp, and Allegiance was the first plumber to respond within minutes. They immediately sent options for appointments and arrived exactly within the time frame they scheduled. Garrod came out and was able to diagnose and fix my disposal within 5 minutes. As promised, the service call to diagnose the problem was complimentary and I asked how much the charge was for the time he had taken to drive out and actually get it working. He said it was no charge because it was such an easy fix. I'm blown away by his honesty. This is officially my new plumber and I am highly recommending them to friends and family. Look no further."
vz8agGeY7FV_qK08Nx4FBg,1,"In the past we have had good experience with this company but this morning they screwed us.  Made a reservation on line last night for a cab to the airport at 5am.  After not receiving the promised call back with a confirmation I had to call them.  They initially could not find the reservation.  After about 10 minutes on the phone the reservation was found and he assured me it was set.

Well, at 5 minutes after 5 this morning I finally got a call from the driver telling me he was late and 15 minutes away.  I told him to forget it.  Had to drive ourselves.

End result will be $120 parking bill at the airport due to their incompetence!"
-ZthUHw94bxDXhQF4pkjBg,5,"Love this place. The prices are great, and the selection of craft beer is even better. The staff is very caring. They know their stuff and can recommend you new things to try based on what you've already had. I walked in today, and it had been awhile since I've been in. The man at the counter immediately remembered me and my preference for hard root beer. They had just received a large shipment of a limited run of my favorite line, and at bottom dollar prices! It really showed the attention to detail and care that goes into operating this establishment. I'll definitely be returning. Check the place out! I highly recommend it."
R0YVDMRQ0AnmuWc9mbeGHg,1,"I'm not going to get  too much into  patient care.

The hospital lacks basic cleanliness (open drywall damage, improper cleaning of floors, sinks and tubs). 

The hospital does not offer many basics that other hospitals offer. Wifi, access to the internet.

In the birthing center,  they overtly say they do not support the mothers birthing partner. No bed, no couch, no chair. There is a bench, but it is in such poor shape and lacks cleanliness. Also, no pillow or blanket for the birthing partner. 

Furniture in the room is extremely dangerous for anyone holding a baby. One Chair broke to pieces when sat in (weight jokes aside, she was 180 lbs maybe).  The second chair in the room, was in similar shape. 

House keeping will not clean your room. They come at 3am to empty garbages only. Once they woke us up to comment on our garbage after it wasn't changed in 24 hours.

This is a teaching hospital, which seems to translate to: focus on the teaching, look what's happening with the patient. The care was good, don't get me wrong. But we were made to felt like if we tried to make my wife's care a first priority we would pay later. 

The induction facilities are horrible in comparison to other hospitals in the province.

You have to pay for supplies for your care, while in care. 
Your have to pay for diapers while in care. 

Family and friends are not able to even sit in the waiting room prior to an after hours birth. (Our biggest gripe)


At the end of our stay, we received a package asking us if we were a grateful patient (read: give us a donation). 
No we were not grateful. We did what we had to to get through their issues and enjoy the birth of our son. 

I fully support the removal of their board of directors. They provide very poor direction."

CRggtio1QsAjvfNV-cgJYQ,1,This place has the worst customer service ever. The owner (lady) is very rude and argumentative. I ordered the pho but the chicken was boiled not grilled so I asked to change my order and she argues with me that I should've asked if they offer grilled instead of assuming. Then she refused to take a new order and argued until we walked out. Never going here again.

It's nice because there is only one stop each way. The airport itself, is very clean! One of my favorite art displays can be found here. Happy hunting :) 

Lots of of little shops and places to eat. The price point is pretty average for an airport. If ya haven't gotten the gambling itch scratched yet, no worries, the airport has ya covered there! Lots of slot machines."

qP5lSICEbBX_CLJyTME27Q,5,"I have found the best Naan in town people!

I love the naan made in Delhi and made my peace with the fact that I could never find it here, until... I found Jaipur Grille!

The naan here is so good and I've tried it along with the Butter Chicken which is good, the Palak Paneer which is amazing and a Lamb dish whose name I'm forgetting. But trust me, this is one of the better Indian Restaurants and I find myself hardly disappointed with the choices. They also have the best Mango Lassi in town ;)

The service is great and the staff goes out of their way even if you order take out. Would definitely recommend this place!"
GLOlxzmqu7oXWIGsxZVR1Q,4,"Had very few problems here over the years I've been going, Tanya at the first drive through window has always been cheery and it helps put me in a good mood for the morning.

Food is usually fresh and service usually snappy."

I contacted an agent named Libby about a property that they had for sale and days went by till I got a call from some guy named Dan. He never even gave his last name.  I had to chase him down days later to get the info I requested. He stated that where he was he had terrible cell phone service and that he had actually broken his cell phone. I never did receive a phone call from the original agent. And then they said they were going to send me some information, which they never did.  I do not recommend this office."
iZgORID1Z5O7CJEEfaH4mA,3,It's very nice inside and comfy. But one time we went and they were playing music so loud that we couldn't even talk:( the foods okay but there dessert menus is good and same with their coffee. I don't personally like there food.

rXG_uGVpjyfUVQl-as_7XA,5,"I did not stay at the New York New York, so I cannot speak for the rooms.  We stayed at the Aria, but went to the New York New York casino 3 different times during our trip!

We first stopped in just to look, and then were instantly sucked in by the pizza right by the front door. It was SO GOOD. Maybe it was the serious hunger that was taking over our group at that point, but it was delicious. 

The casino here was excellent.  While stuffing our faces with pizza, we noticed the ""$5 Blackjack, All Day, Every Day"" sign.  Blackjack was our game, and we couldn't believe that $5 tables existed.  ALL DAY.  We noticed that many other hotels began the morning with minimums at $10, then raised them during the day.

I wanted to write this review to specifically thank the manager that assisted us that day (June 21st).  The casino was busy, and we were walking around aimlessly for the $5 tables. We stopped to ask someone to direct us to the area where these tables were. We assumed we were going to get a quick point in a direction, but that we did not.  A manager (I'm sorry if that's not what they are called- the ones in suits who stand behind the dealers is who I'm talking about!) took the time to walk us ALL THE WAY over to the tables.  He engaged us in conversation the whole way over, and when we got to the tables he discovered that there was not 4 open seats for us to all play together.  He made his way over to an open table, a $15 blackjack table, and had the dealer let us all play for $5!  I was amazed at how kind this man was to us.  I did not catch is name unfortunately, but he was a shorter man who was bald and wore glasses! When there are plenty of gamblers spending WAY more money than we were, we were so impressed to receive this kind of service.

Next time we are back in Vegas, I will be sure to visit the New York New York again! (And hopefully win some more on those $5 tables!)   Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
KEyl49CSrO3F0fxox_lmyw,2,"This place is ok, nothing amazing. The cornbread is a standout dish which was a bit surprising. Service is haphazard, but friendly. The ribs were overcooked and dry. The rest of the food was also pretty standard bbq and nothing overly amazing. Portions are not huge. I probably wouldn't go back or recommend to others, as there are other plenty of other bbq joints in the city to check out. It seems hard for restaurants to do really good ribs - so it is probably a timing thing or something."
0cI6enhrVu-pHhGth-54iA,3,"I came to OTB today because I saw in a review that they have a paleo menu, which is so wonderful. I'm doing Whole30 for the month, and realized how few restaurants in Pittsburgh have compliant meals. So, thank you guys for working to include this alternate menu. 

Unfortunately the server recommended the lettuce wraps, but I would not order these again. You couldn't pick the wraps up, so it was just like a small salad. It also lacked flavor and I had to add my side salad dressing to it. The side salad was large, simple and the Mediterranean dressing was delicious. 

I'd come back to try other things on the paleo menu, but not the lettuce wraps."
XtM0_IaBtADI3B51orABhg,3,"I wasn't overly impressed with Blue Canyon. Instead of looking rustic and vintage I thought the decor looked dirty and old. Short ribs were great. I was anxiously awaiting my seafood mac'n'cheese and was very disappointed. It tasted nothing like mac'n'cheese - it was like a fish bomb went off in my mouth. Not to be gross. The dessert was great and the service was excellent - we got the s'mores dessert. It was my birthday and we actually ordered one to split but there was a miscommunication and all 6 of us ended up getting our own, which we had one bite of (oh, well!).  I went last August and I'm in no rush to go back."
kbFi3yV_l1URpNZTrvYnhg,4,"Tried this place out since high ratings on Yelp and it was on Food Network as one of the top places for great food at great prices.  

As most have mentioned the stuffed Dates were amazing (I was a little hesitant to try - but certainly was worth it).  We also had the Artichoke Toast, Ham & Cheese Croquetas, Camarones Ajillo & Terra y Mare Skewers.  Our favorite was the Terra y Mare Skewers.  I am not a shrimp fan but the Camarones Ajillo was our 2nd favorite with a great sauce.

Service was great and very helpful to assist us on first time visiting.  We did make reservation ahead of time just in case and it was a great experience overall to dine at this place.

If you are in the area this is a great place to eat and you have to try a little bit of everything.  Overal for the 5 plates, 2 drinks & 2 desserts our meal was $50.  I believe this is a great price for the quality of the food with the great service."
kJOThZRy5C3GQAqVE81-JA,5,"I came here with three friends, and we should have made a reservation! I think we waited about 40 minutes because we wanted a table outside. It was worth the wait. The place has a great atmosphere and a large patio in the back.  The back patio has a lot of trees, nice lighting, candles, and a fireplace. 

This place is a little on the expensive side, but all of us enjoyed our food and it is worth it for the ambiance. I had the Howie Burger, which is a gourmet burger with gruyere (which is a cheese), caramelized onions, and Dijon sauce. It was delicious! The hostess and server were both friendly. The server even asked us if we wanted separate checks, which was refreshing and made things easy! I will definitely be back."
ySR6fBmVGYiXoXGSUslhlQ,5,For the last seven years I have gone to one of the most popular nail salons in Summerlin but I have been really been unimpressed with them lately so I tried Charming Nails and I LOVE them. I see MJ and he does beautiful work and they have so many color selections in gel that match their regular polish colors as well. Everyone in the salon is nice and friendly and it's very clean! I have been telling everyone I know in Summerlin to try them out...it's a hidden gem.
w9Fj3kSqB-VendKRi0ux7A,4,"The Pie Commission came highly recommended. I was in the neighbourhood so I checked them out. No signage from the road so I drove past the location twice. Tucked away in a small unit behind the Main Street building  on The Queensway is this little gem. Simple menu. Good wholesome food. Lots of parking. A small outside seating area. Typically take out food. I bought a 4 pack of uncooked pies. I tried their sausage rolls, and I have to say I died and went to heaven. The pastry was flakey not dry and the sausage meat flavourful was packed tightly inside. Brought me back to a moment in time inside a bakery in Ireland where pies and sausage rolls where baked fresh daily. Looking forward to trying the pies I purchased. No doubt I will be back."
XIWvY4WkJqa6jd6yVbmdyg,3,"First off, the waiters there are really nice.  Our waitress was really busy, but she was really nice and kept us happy even when she wasn't around.

They had a live blues band in the bar.  They sounded pretty good, but the bar is kinda small and then to add a band?!  

I ordered the BBQ brisket salad with sweet tea and it came with biscuits.  Now the biscuits are kinda weird.  They look like a roll, crumble like a muffin, and taste like cake.  I KNOW!  Weird!  (see photos) I was expecting some real homemade southern biscuits.  And the apple butter was cinnamon butter NOT apple butter.  I was all confused, and we only ended up getting one basket (2 biscuits) cause our waitress was so busy and the other staff forgot us.

The salad was descent.  The size of it was huge.  The meat wasn't that tender.  Kinda disappointed with it.  My husband got a burger.  And said it was the best burger he ever had.   

Desert was really good.......chocolate cake.  Yum!

I think its a good place to come with family or spouse.  Prices are normal for a BBQ place.  BUT I like my Tom's BBQ the best!!"
mnqfSwc2O-_j9sSPeS7Fqg,4,"I like the other Luna location in Cleveland Heights and was very excited to see them open on this side of town. The fact is, they are still getting their sea legs.

I loved the interior here! They have an abundance of seating (you'll never fight for a table) with cute, colorful chairs and fun paper lanterns. There's tons of open space with plenty of natural light and cute succulents sitting on some tables. The bummer was when I ordered a coffee and it was served to me cold. On a chilly day, I had intentionally wanted a warm drink. They seemed frustrated I asked them to make it hot and I felt super awkward. The staff didn't know what to do. We also ordered a few breakfast pastries, which were fine.

I didn't get much of an impression. I'll be back soon to give 'em another shot. The parking is easy (a free lot) and they are located in a cool location amongst a few other boutiques and restaurants."

5dTYNR7UO-ax4GVMKF4Umg,1,Well you will get yelled at for laughing and the person sitting behind will come out of no where after sitting behind you saying he can't hear his friends talk. If you want a quiet place go to a family restaurant not that we were really loud. You know just the usual laughing after a long day trying to unwind. So I will never go back because of the dumb ass people that come here. The lady at the BAR actually said can you be quiet we are trying to have a personal convo. If it wasn't for my girlfriend k probably would have fought a few people. Keep in mind we had two beer and a shot when this happened. Service is good though

Huge play structure for kids of all ages to run, jump, climb, and slide. I'd say it's optimized for ages 2-7.
Decent-sized area with other toys for playing kitchen, blocks, or drawing, a few books, and a small section for baby-types.
Several couches for parents to sit, massage chairs, nail stations, an elliptical machine, a couple dumbbells.
Also a bunch of tables so you can bring your own snacks in or buy some of theirs (decent snack selection for kids, but high-priced, of course).
10-visit punch card for $60.
Can't beat that."
PRyM9-zGedMjnqBaL2kX8w,1,"The service was terrible, they made a huge deal about me asking for extra cheese. The lady working there made a fat joke about my bf and she laughed in my face. They didn't have anymore food so my burrito bowl was skimped on the ingredients over all a terrible experience I will never come here again."
TZ9DucsRzyey20kH40bYgA,5,"Drove almost an hour across town to get here.  I must say, worth the trip.  Short rib tacos were delicious.  Everyone in my group thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well.  Wait staff are super cute in their suspenders and extremely friendly.  Loved this place!"
FOrJLZQnPYiXGbot_nrC_g,5,Stopped by this Range on the way out of Vegas very nice great price and unlimited targets friendly staff very clean I'll make sure it will be place I visit ever time I come out to visit can't go wrong!
6jVKRE3DqEqAOVJlchw3ow,1,"I specifically called and made an appointment and was reassured there wouldn't be a wait time. I normally don't mind waiting but I called to make sure since I was busy. I went in and still had to wait and in the end, there was too much time wasted. If they were honest in the first place, it would've been fine. I could've easily came another time. I do not like it when people waste my time. Terrible service and terrible greeting. Extremely disappointed."
JPyiuRrsEVZaNHmCGWP2CQ,1,Worst company ever. DS services has no idea what they are doing. Do not use them. You will continue to be billed long after canceling the service. Good luck getting someone on the phone to help you

I dont know if she added sugar to it but it had a subtle taste of sweetness to it. Soooo goood. This will be where im buying my beans from now on to use on my breville barista express machine."

n19A9iQpl8vx4k4STDR9Tg,2,"It gets two stars because the server was gracious and the beet salad was OK.  The, entree, however, was horrible.  Horrible.   It was a pasta dish that arrived late, was cold and flavorless. Not sure what I was eating..  So I didn't. Glad I bought the $12 small plate and not the $20 entree.  Two bites into that pablum and I quit."
CIe96eCgaWim_cESf8Bo2w,5,"I've been searching to and fro for the perfect nail technician to do my favorite marble nail style (mind you this took me about 4+ salons total in less than a year lol) and ultimately I have found my OG nailist and I'll never turn back. Amber is hands down amazing! She's a skilled perfectionist and I am blessed to have her here in Vegas. Finally someone who knows their stuff! She even lets me know of her process in an informative manner and definitely takes her time with me until I am satisfied to a T (my first mani/pedi session with her took about 4 hours due to my pickiness, so I am eternally grateful of her patience with me).

My first and second visit have exceeded my expectations so far. Usually when I set up an appointment I would do both my mani and pedi. You can always text Amber and Ashton (both are lovely and professional in their own way) for inquiries or set up and appointment on their website, its that easy, no frills. Because they're pretty established though, it would be best to book at least a month in advance since the bookings on the website tend to fill up quickly. 

On my first session with Amber I wanted a rose gold chrome with a marble style design. It was definitely a challenge for her but in the end everything was golden with her attention to detail and I absolutely LOVE how the color complimented my skin tone. For my second session, I opted for a classic white marble nail design but with a touch of foiled silver to give it a refined and polished look. Needless to say I got compliments on both of them from friends and family, both genders included yay!

Scratch Nail Spa is located at the corner of Sunset and McLeod, across from Sunset Park's volley ball court. Take note that the nail spa is inside of the Canvas Salon building. 

11/10 would get my nails done again and again!"

The hostess and servers were very friendly, but it took them 10 minutes to set up a table on the patio for 8 of us, even though the patio was pretty much empty at the time.  The food and drinks were good, but the appetizers specifically were a bit small.  I'll likely return for a Happy Hour, and hopefully when I do, it will be better."

7vBl8oCqFKofpraLi2ZkyA,4,After a few trips to Riga Tony's for lunch I am a fan... They have a great weekly lunch special each day for $6.95 each dish comes with a really good Antipasta salad with a really good dressing.  The ciabatta bread is always really fresh and hot great for dipping.. I highly recommend the baked rigatony with Italian sausage Wednesday and baked stuffed shells Thursday. I will be back for sure it's great good with great prices.
ab18VyRiof8F6rK3q-kvzQ,4,"Yum!

I loved ordering my custom poutine on the little form. It came out promptly and it was delicious. The cheese curds had that telltale squeak, the gravy was rich, and the fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I also opted to get bacon and jalapenos, which just brought the whole thing to another level.

The staff are sweet and friendly, which makes the dining experience even nicer."
pycrAgjXsnLkLK-jQvCd3Q,2,"I only been here once, and the AC happened to be busted that day.  It was getting worked on at the time but I must eat, and my lunch break was running out.  So I had to stay.  

The location was a little dirty, the floors were greasy, the loo needed to be cleaned up, and the service was slow.  The staff was friendly though, just slow.

The meal was a great deal!  The chicken itself was artery clogging greasy.  All that grease could of easily slip right through the table....  

Overall a typical fast food joint, don't really see me coming back to this location."
KZ2nWNZjeXyI5XnMJdsKNQ,4,"Went here for lunch on a Saturday, not too busy.  We were greeted right away and had the choice of patio or indoors. Our server was really friendly, we checked in on yelp and got the chips and salsa for free. Ordered the BLT and it was really good, they don't slack on the protein!  Also really liked their ice tea.  Seems like they have happy hour pretty much all the time so I'll be coming back again soon!"
mb31pI_1rE69W9P8Jg0mYw,3,"The food is good but the service is so so. I had to wait and get waitress attention to get my drink refilled. No one came to check if things ok.
I ordered the Pilgrim for my daughter but she doesn't like onions. I asked if the onions can be taken off. The waitress replied with No addition or substitution. Hello, this is called ""substraction"". I didn't ask for extra or change. If you can't accommodate a simple request like this, I will think twice if I will come again. Take care of your customers and improve the service."
YcEC4uIkPDSL9AnK70DvNQ,3,"I have a 2003 Mustang GT with some issues but none that were a show stopper until yesterday. :^0

The diagnostics were kinda pricy BUT the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairs.

I dropped off my vehicle late Friday about 4:30 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed: that did not happen, which concerned me. :^\

When I came in Saturday morning, my car was in the bay being looked at. I had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which I don't think they would have charged me for. :^)

I don't know everything about car repair but I can tell most of the time if I am being B.S.ed. 

They recommended about four repairs to fix one problem.

One repair they recommended I know was needed but I feel weren't necessary. In other words, I have been driving with this condition for some time (three years) and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon (that was just two months ago). 

Don't get me wrong: it is not like Meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith: it was one shops opinion versus another's (along with my my previous research into the issue) that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while.   

It's hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but I needed to get it done sooner or later so I opted to get it done that day because the cost was VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE AND I BELIEVED THE SHOP WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

They did recommend a spark plug change (as that could have contributed to my issue) but if they had actually checked the plugs, they would have seen that they were fine and recently changed.

I just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but I will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the car's OBD calibrates.

1/1/16 Update:

No problems with the repair and satisfied with the service: I have not had any more issues with my car so I have not been back which is VERY GOOD!

I would recommend this place to a friend for sure!"
PxYqy7ACVdqjhZynV2S4Aw,5,Got a great haircut today for my son and I.   Prices are very reasonable.  Suzy is awesome and always does a great job. They have refreshments and a nice waiting area.  Thanks again Suzy!!
JySQxY-mghjOpuiFmpb-tQ,4,"I had high tea at this restaurant. It was a great place for brunch. High tea is a great deal and worth the value. It's only available until 6pm, but they have a full menu available as well. The service was good. The food was fresh and delicious I will definitely be back. I can't wait to bring all my friends."
hqb_YLD9yo-P0j58d4dljQ,5,"I came here for brunch on a happy chance. Score! this little hole in the wall was a winner. A small store front café in a strip mall, the interior is tastefully decorated, there is alfresco dining outside under the canopy. We sat down at a 4 top table. Gabriele herself waited on us. She told us about the day's special which was a meatball sandwich with a side of pasta salad included. After a few minutes we decided on 3 specials. The order was up within minutes.The sandwiches were very good. Gabriela told me they make their meatballs and sauce. The pasta salad was good also. I will be back to try some of the breakfast menu"

L'extérieur de la pâtisserie ne paye pas de mine et entre-nous....ne donne pas très envie de s'y arrêter! 
Mais passe cette impression, on découvre une petite terrasse intérieure après quelques marches avec vue sur des vitrines bien garnies et sur une boutique très très bien achalandée! 
Il faut aller commander directement au ""comptoir""! 
J'y suis passé uniquement pour une pause café-chocolat avec des amies...mais je sais que pour l'une d'entre elles qui habite pas très loin...c'est un incontournable du quartier!
Le chocolat chaud que j'ai dégusté était parfait, chocolaté et sucré à point...un vrai régal!

8wpVNfgtQO3bud-HU0ciOA,3,"Meh...I went here for the Lakers game today.  They have appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, and salads.  The O'Connell burger that I ordered, which had bacon was just so-so.  The fries were decent.  The Coors Light was a little flat.  Overall, just an average sports bar.  The crowd here seemed a little older."
-H2PA_ZfCS91Iz2-XoYZtw,5,"It takes a special salad to leave a lasting memory such that I fantasize about it for days post-nosh. Usually this is an honour reserved for things covered in cheese. But the Muay Thai salad box at Veghed is one whose flavours I've been craving since I first consumed it last week. Packed with over 12 veggies, cold noodles, and tossed in a light but flavourful dressing, its both satisfying and delicious. There is so much going on that every bite is a little different and you never get bored. Also, its huge so I couldn't finish it in one sitting, but it was just as good (and not wilted at all!) when I dug into a few hours later. 

Top it off with a healthful turmeric, ginger, apple juice and you will basically feel invincible."
zJ2F3bId-wPTFBIW8luxgQ,4,The huevos here are SO great! Perfectly cooked eggs on top of tortillas with beans in between mmmm goodness. I also had some of the croissant with egg and it was good but I preferred the huevos. My only complaint is that I ordered the scones with jam and they weren't warmed up.
MD4C9BH90qM9t54mNvxyaw,5,"Let me say, this is not a store where the employees will be nice to you, ask you if you need help finding anything, or do anything at all to make you feel welcome, but it's soooo worth it.  

This dump has everything.  Piles and piles of fabric, ribbons, trim, notions, and so much various craft stuff it'll make your head spin.  Tiny pink and blue clothespins, cute little patches, bra straps, fake fur in every color of the rainbow, mini-chain by the yard, huge bins of zippers...I could go on and on.  If you make crafts you need to come to this store.  The prices are pretty good, too.  It's a magical place, complete with the angry trolls that cut your fabric and take your payment."
rFJGAr2GnOLDgZ1ATQuzhA,3,"I gave 3 stars for a few reasons. The first one was the music. For a trendy spot, the playlist was a mix of older music that didn't enhance my experience. The restaurant week menu looked appetizing but everything I tried was average, nothing blew my mind. The salad and bruschetta had some good flavors and the zucchini pappardelle was not was I visually expected at all.  The brown baby butter cake was pretty fabulous and saved my dining experience. Our server was great and very patient with my friend and I and all our questions. It wasn't my worst meal out but it didn't impress me enough to be back soon."
Te3f--N-8FNxVXE5yUM-ow,4,"So this used to be Madhatter's. Talked to the bartender, they are under new ownership, most of the employees are familiar faces. I used to attend Jason Devore shows here and I hope that continues. I stop here between a large gap in classes I have a few days a week to study and have a small pitcher of beer. Great prices for beer, friendly and hospitable staff, and a good escape from shitty college kids seeing as I'm a 26 year old freshman. 
The menu for the most part seems very typical for a bar and grill. That being said, you must try their wings, which are all-you-can-eat on Mondays. Perfectly breaded and still gives a good crunch, without becoming soggy with the sauce. The Spicy BBQ is not spicy in my opinion, but has a real good chipotle flavor. The tequila smoke wings are strong on the lime, like a smokey margarita. The Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon wings are good, you can definitely taste the bourbon, but honestly I could not detect the maple very much. YOU MUST TRY THE SWEET AND SPICY JAMESON WINGS, THEY ARE AMAZING. The manager made me try his ""Ultimate Sauce,"" which is their spiciest, but not anything you can't handle, it is not a ""gimmicky"" hot, and it has great flavor. Even if you are afraid of spice, I would definitely recommend it. I will definitely be here every Monday putting away $13 all-you-can-eat wings like I'm trying to eat them out of business."
rtneZRNNxQWGpwYsbOfBcw,5,Best Mexican place ever. Only knock is the wait can be awhile so order in advance! I usually get a few tacos and a pork burrito. Their hot sauce is crazy hot but so worth it and tasty.
lRp5FLoSv3Uoh1MukrOr5Q,4,"Came here with a group of 5 for the first time during Summerlicious and was pleasantly surprised. 

Food: For the starter I had the Shrimp Toast, the shrimp on top was sweet/sour/spicy but a bit too much. The pancake however was stuffed with shrimp and very tasty. My friend got the Penang Chicken which she liked but the Shrimp Toast was better.  We also ordered their classic slaw with salmon sashimi off the a la carte menu and it was delicious. It's a huge portion of 19, fresh ingredients with a light dressing. However, it was $12 extra for only a few pieces of fish. For mains I ordered the Pan Seared Halibut. The fish was okay but I liked the turnip cakes a lot. My friend tried the Duck Confit which was tender and flavourful, I wish I had ordered that instead. For dessert, you get a trio of Strawberry Rhubarb Compote with chia seeds, Coconut Panna Cotta and a Brownie. The compote was probably my favorite, while the brownie was nothing special.   

Drinks: I had the Shanghai 75 which was fresh tasting with cucumber and ginger while my friend had the White Orchid which was sweet with lychee and more boozy on the tongue. Both of the drinks (and all of the food) was presented beautifully. 

Service: Our server was professional and happy to provide us with suggestions for food and drink. All of the courses were timed perfectly and we never felt rushed. 

Atmosphere: The restaurant is beautiful decorated, a bit on the formal side with dim lighting and tons of Asian influence. I would highly recommend for a date. My only comment, which I'm not even sure they can do anything about, is that there were quite a few homeless people that would pass by and ask for change from patrons on the patio. It was hard to enjoy our meal and not feel guilty."
Y6LaE0aK7Gbf2f93sq8GIQ,4,"I've never been to any other Serendipity so I wouldn't know the comparison, but this place has it's flare.  I like the bright and clean decor.  I really like that it has a to-go order window outside which beats having to wait for a table when you're in a rush in Vegas.

They have pretty tasty treats.  I loved my cookies and cream ice cream on a waffle cone.  It was perfect in Vegas' hot weather.  They also have donuts, milk shakes and sundaes.  I tried my friends' selections and everything tasted good!  I want to come back to really enjoy the atmosphere on my next visit."
rNYF8DAM0HqVU7yl_XkYMA,4,"2 1/2 years ago I discovered SAS Cupcakes in the Ballantyne area. These cupcakes were huge and full of flavor not to mention moist. A little pricey but so worth it! Now I have no clue if they have changed bakers but one thing is for sure, its not the same. The quality as well as the size (which are substantially smaller) have changed, but bet your sweet Ant Fanny the prices have remained the same.  I am happy to say that my company will be looking for a new bakery to get our treats from."
ObMUM_qCzd1bWwkdA9WFlg,4,"Great rice rolls and great prices!! I came here for lunch and ordered the soy sauce beef rice roll, chicken congee and deep fried dough. The beef rice rolls were delicious! The rice roll wrap is thin, delicate and smooth and inside is packed with a lot of ingredients. The congee and deep fried dough were just average though. What we ordered was enough to feed two for lunch. Came out to $13.75 before tax! Will be back again!"
YmTYMHCgjU6tacvOOhUHGw,5,"Brunch this morning with my hubby. The restaurant is gorgeous! The food excellent. The made to order omelets and crepes were hot, fresh and delicious.

Had confit duck wings - not what i expected. I prefer duck confit leg version way more.

Ok food. Nice beers."
EgSEDhw8s75i8FxsW7wanA,2,"Pro: food here are decent.

Con: long wait for food even when the restaurant is less than half full, waited 20+ minutes for a medium cook burger.

The soda I order is very watered down.

Also tips are mandatory even when I m in party of 4.  It's not like I m not gonna tip, but feel weird that the server ask me to choose to tip between 3 options, which is 15, 18 or 20%"

_dOoU2NGPMpKhpu3dAc2pQ,4,"This review is solely for their dumplings, and I am OBSESSED with them. Their pork dumplings are my favorite, and I usually get them pan fried. Very tasty and juicy (almost reminds me the little soup dumplings aka xiao long bao). They make their dumplings freshly by hand, and although they only have three options, you can ask them if they could provide something else for you. I haven't done this personally just because I already know I want their pork dumplings. I do order something else to try alongside my dumplings just so I'm not too biased. 

I have tried three of their fruit smoothies, and you can tell that they actually are drinks made from actual fruit. None of that powder stuff. 

Staff members are attentive and give amazing service..which is rare at a chinese restaurant. The boss already recognized me my second visit, so their dumplings + the recognition makes me keep coming here."
Gl1P6_uVlkFQGqERpQpTTw,3,"Good burger, but a little pricy.  Nice decor and good service, but this place just didn't do it for me.  Only been there once and I've never felt the desire to go back.  But if you're in the area and want a burger (and have a few bucks to spare), they're pretty good."
59FS8PpTyHCJs4LXv9Hwrg,4,"I really enjoyed Hussong's for lunch. Good tex-mex, similar to what you'd find in the Southwest where they actually do tex-mex well. Anyway, it's a yummy place to stop for chips, guac, and margs while shopping at Mandalay Bay.

The restaurant did not have a lot of frills, rather basic decor, but the food is very good. I had chips and guacamole to start, and the chips were perfectly crispy without being greasy. The guacamole was fresh, and well-balanced with heat and acid. I had the fish baja tacos, and they were very good as well. I loved the avocado salsa.

My friend and I also ordered a pitcher of the original margarita. It was fantastic. No sour mix!! Just tequila (and a lot of it), agave, and freshly squeezed lime juice. These margaritas are very drinkable, but be forewarned, they do pack a punch. I went back to my hotel room after lunch and proceeded to take a nice long nap.

I highly recommend Hussong's as a fun place to stop for lunch if you're in the mood for good tex-mex."
jh0AhI9VnLk14B4RRbIosw,4,"When so many restaurants here are closed on Sundays, it was great to find a good one that was open. And not just good - we had an absolutely marvelous meal here. Tasty bean pupusas made with rice flour (instead of wheat), scrumptious and moist chicken tamales, and delicious fried plantains for dessert. (We did not get the sweet plantains & cream but the 'dinner' ones with pureed black beans, and I found those sweet enough by themselves.)

The staff was quite friendly to us, and it didn't hurt that my companion could hold her own conversing in Spanish with them. Yet the food by itself was so enjoyable, my stomach was grinning the whole way home. ¡Ricissimo!"
JusWbqIehAks66O17-jxag,5,Great storage facility. Outstanding employees such as Pia work there and helped me get everything I need. Place is really clean.
ygKU2tKhGmsZXy1pcPUyVA,4,"We went here because it was on our way to Mandalay Bay. Burgers, and fries, where could you go wrong? To me it was like a sports bar minus the awkwardness if you don't know every single player on every team. 

What I remember most is the...wait for it,...Nutella Burger. Yes, you heard me right. I know, I was confused when I saw it on the dessert menu. I was even more confused when it was placed in front of me. It is served  as a warm donut (Krispy Kreme-style), Nutella mousse patty, passion-fruit gelatin (fake cheese -NOT from a can), fresh strawberries and kiwi slices (fake pickles). Even as I ate it my mind was confused: It was delicious, but it's a burger..but it's not..it's supposed to be meaty...not sweet..wut? 

Yum."

tRGv8hONgW6TKPKfDO-WEw,3,"Another trip, another visit to Sarah's Kitchen for the $1.49 breakfast special which is the cheapest deal in greater Las Vegas.  On our arrival there were several empty tables, but we had to wait until one was bused.  It took a long time for us to receive menus and silverware because our server had the energy of a sloth.  The breakfast itself, when it finally arrived, was once again very good, easy over eggs just like we ordered, crispy bacon, hash browns and toast.  We we be back? It all depends on what happens with the Klondike bankruptcy proceedings because either the casino will close or new owners will takeover and may or may not continue the various specials."
rq4s0Q-6PNrL05xN4r0sLg,1,"Went on a slow Tuesday night. My party of 4, the largest group in the building, was ignored from the moment we walked in. My girlfriend and I had to drink from my friends' bucket of beer because the bar tender didn't even walk over to us until she felt it necessary to come and snatch the menus, which we had to get ourselves, out of our hands saying only ""we're only serving off this late night menu."" Not once was eye contact made and not once was a smile given the entire stay of nearly 3 hours. After leaving the tab in cash on the bar and leaving, we were chased outside by the same bartender who accused us of not paying our bill, having not even looked at the bar right where we were sitting, apparently. After we told her we left it on the bar the only response from her was ""cause if you don't pay it then I have to."" For a group of 4 who all work in restaurants, this low level service in, what was thought to be a reputable bar in the ballantyne area, was appalling."
4fSdUglNs7Pe7PKYpMa7GA,5,"Great! Came here a few weeks ago to purchase my fiancé som sandals. The shoe clerk was PHENOMENAL! He knew so much about the products and had such a positive attitude throughout the experience. We ended up buying a pair of Chacos and my guy says they are the comfiest shoes he's ever had! Great selection of shoes, clothes, outdoor gear, and even kayaks! We will be back for supplies before our Hawaiian honeymoon in April!"
WSW0lZ4qZXXempUXD2istQ,4,Smugs has been a perenial favourite since I arrived in Calgary in 1983. It is probably my favourite prime rib house and while it has seen some transitions the quality of food and service has not diminished. The simple salad bar is fresh and the Portuguese Bean and Sausage soup is awesome! Prime rib sandwich makes for an excellent lunch! There are other excellent choices too!
PY_yaJf94BC29txLbBsWsw,3,"I started my night of bar hopping with a friend here at Stake Out. 

Our bartenders were extremely nice! Two older ladies who made a point to ask for our names, chat with us, and tell us about themselves. Our service was a bit slow, even though the place was nearly empty.

There are two pool tables upstairs that are only 50 cents a game! This is definitely one of my go-to spots to play pool.

The beer and alcohol list is a little sparse, but the price is right. If you want some nice beers, walk over to the Freakin' Frog, but enjoy the domestic beers and cheap food while you are here.

We ordered a few tacos (Taco Tuesday - two for $1.49) which were satisfying, but average tasting. 

This place has the most awkward men's bathroom I've ever been in.

All in all, I'll definitely come back to play pool upstairs and chat with the bartenders, but probably wouldn't make it a point to come here if I didn't want to play pool."
K9CUOO-BpuCVKQyCDULPwg,5,"Great addition to the neighborhood. I've been several times to the Chandler location and I'm glad that we now have one in our backyard. 

Grapefruit moon juice ipa is a must and try the brewers fries."
7bq2PfK8qY-pVqvXJbYvPA,2,"I checked this place out recently and thought the facilities were decent.  Not as new as some other places around town, but definitely up there.  

However, at the end of my tour the pushy salesman refused to let me try a work out.  I guess he expected me to sign my life away without even working out there once.  Not gonna happen.

Based on my experience and after reading some other comments on Yelp about the sales tactics I would definitely avoid this place. There are plenty of other great gyms in the area."
JaSQ7q0LvrfUx4LfSFr3KA,1,"My girlfriends and I went for summerlious. The appetizer was OK. We had the pate and oyster. For entree, we all got the steak frites. Fries were overly salted and the steak was a disappointment. We asked for two mediums and a rare the waiter brought us three mediums. So I had to sit there and wait for my steak while two of my friends were eating theirs. Not to mention one of the medium was too rare so we had to send that one back too. The dessert was no good either. The creme brulée was not smooth, the eggs were cooked during the process. 

Service was terrible. The waiters hardly did anything. No one came and ask if my food was okay. Terrible."

1chervU90PFLslqaOPO4SA,1,This place is just plain Awful!!! I had not been there in 10 years. I ordered the baked cod special with green beans. The green beans came right out of a can and were cold. The cod was the size of a pinkie finger and had not one ounce of flavor. They had the nerve to charge$8.60! I could have had two giant fish sandwiches at my local legion for that price. My Mother had fried cauliflower. It came right out of a box and you could barely chew it. She also had liver and onions which used to be excellent and it was awful. This place has really gone downhill and I will never return. There are many nicer and finer places to go in the area and a lot cheaper! Chef Ramsey would have a stroke if he ate there!!  Stay Away!!!!!
76__-JHFadfe5wklMxmiYg,1,"Not sure where to even begin with these guys, if your looking for cheap then this is your bunch, that is until they start with the excuses as to why they need more money to do the same job they bid. These guys over promised and under delivered from the start and they are very adapt at one person talking with you and agreeing to what should and will be done and the other shows up with a completely different agenda. There is another reviewer that took photos of the trash they left inches under his landscape, I wished I had taken photos of the trash pile I uncovered form one of my planter beds these guys installed. Yes I literally had their lunch trash from McDonald's, Roberto's and another unknown company buried in my planters. Good Luck getting a call back from these guys when we question anything they do, they won't even talk with you when you track them down at one of the local home shows. It has been just over a year since they worked on my yard and I have already had portions of it repaired by another landscape company. Don't fall for their low bid deception, spend the extra money up front and you won't be throwing money at your project to keep it up in the future."
Sh83UG1TgQj6a1et1K3wcA,3,"This is a good place to stop by if you're looking for Southern Filipino food. The staff is friendly and makes you feel like you're hanging out with your friends. I would suggest ordering the lechon with rice for lunch and the ube cheesecake for dessert. The space is small though, so a big party will be hard to seat."

Slot machines. And slot machines in rooms where you can smoke.

Yes, Sin City has slot machines for you while you either wait for you flight or wait for your baggage claim. Why? Why are you feeding to my gambling addiction? (Okay, I don't really have a gambling addiction, but still...)

The only other thing I would like to point out is that half the restaurants and stores shutdown down once it's past 10pm. So much for the city that doesn't sleep."

9JIPgM8VIVMmlBF_wAOx2w,4,"I don't think I can ever eat sushi the same way ever again. The food in this place is amazing. I ordered the chicken + eel (substituted the beef for chicken) don, and volcano california rolls. The eel was perfect, and the flavour was complemented with the rice. The chicken was perfectly soft and sprinkled with an appropriate amount of sesame and seaweed.

The reason this review is not a 5 is because of the service. This restaurant is extremely small (smaller than Sanosotei) and only had 1 waitress at the time. The service was very slow. We had to wait for 15 minutes in order to get our order taken, and this was a Friday night too."
P1uj0pNlEc1iTst12DDYMw,1,"Every Wednesday we come home to a dirty pool even after being told they came and cleaned the pool. We pay over 100 dollars a month to have the pool and jacuzzi swept, vacuumed, skim pool, basket cleaned, backwashed and chemicals maintained. Every Thursday we call to tell them the pool is still dirty and no one touched it. Due to them not maintaining thr chemicals we ended up getting mold and algae. Their office rarely does anything. In fact when we told them about the mold and algae they billed us for them having to put chemicals back in. **Updated Photo. They came today claiming to have brushed the pool. It was not brushed at all**"

I don't have a difficult haircut, but for some reason no barber I've gone to in the past year has been able to come close to what I wanted. Maxera took me right in, put me in the chair and went to work. I have never been more happy! The atmosphere of this place is great, barbers are upbeat and music is full blast. It doesn't bother me I don't speak a word of Spanish, as long as my cut is on point I have no complaints. Will be going back as a regular from this point on. You would be hard pressed to find a place this good. Thanks again for the great haircut. If you're in a rush, and may have to wait go somewhere else. Make sure you dedicate the time because it's absolutely worth every minute."

5pcpr185BZh7X8BRGIzX7g,1,"Looking around Yelp for something special in the area while traveling and my family and I enjoyed the photos and reviews for this spot, so we stopped in for dinner. Not sure why, but we had an awful experiance. Was extremely disappointed with the staff, quality of the food and experience overall.

Family of six and no one enjoyed their meal and said we should have gone to Del Taco after eating here. 

I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!

My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.

The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.

My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad."
fDAL5zmjfq_eDs5Euo2P-A,5,"Went to this show with my friends and we had a blast! Funny, entertaining and engaging. We were skeptical at first, but we were certainly proved wrong. I would certainly recommend this show to people looking for something to do. It also was in the afternoon which was perfect. It was a wonderful break in our day! Definitely go if you can. We loved it!"
D_gBzsvT-J2OzjY15o7rbQ,4,"Yes, good place for great Italian pasta !  Good service and nice size servings. All 6 of us tried something different on menu and everyone was very pleased with what they got!  As we were leaving we met a couple who knew of the one in Madison and Mentor also. Said those were just as good! Anyone who had a ""bad experience"" at Joey's likely just don't like to mix because they do stack you in tight. No big deal for us since we've dined in DC the last 10yrs and that's the norm. If you want to eat at home alone just use their take out and rate the food not your ""bad experience"" !"

Sure it can get hot..think theraputic sauna type heat.  The rest of the year is great! As my friends and family to the east are shoveling snow I am sitting out on my patio.  
Plenty of sun and fun here in the Valley!  I have never been lacking in options for things to do in Phoenix.  I can stay in and play or take on a hike in many of our Urban trails through the city.  We have several great places to eat and play.  There is always something new to try. 

Deciding to live downtown close to work was a decision I enjoy more each day.  But I withhold 1 star for the lack of Green Space/Parks and the unwilling nature to improve the residential/pedestrian conditions through downtown and the need to improve some of the public transportation options through town.  

But I am not just naggin' here as I am one of few that is tryin to get involved to make changes where I can."
imaxgyapjro9iwN9oThs9Q,1,"This is, by far, the most obnoxious restaurant in Montreal. 
The stellar reviews here are mostly coming from out-of-towners but for local Montrealers, Buona Notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole ""St.Laurent Street"" scene. See, back in the late 1980s, that area of St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were, filled to the hilt with the beautiful people, aspiring actresses, models and high-end escorts, places like Business, Mediterraneo or DiSalvio's. Most of them are long-gone now and only Buona Notte still hangs on. Come Formula 1 weekend, you can only book a table at Buona Notte if you agree to the $5000 ""bottling fee""  and its filled with F1 jet-set types and the aforementioned models and escorts-types hoping to make a break. The reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your meal.

This has a good-looks-and-money entrance policy. If you don't make the cut, you're not getting in and even if you do have a reservation, they'll place you at one of the worse-off tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front. I came here once on a date years ago and I remember the waitresses in skimpy super-tight dresses, the wall of signed plates by the likes of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame or Jerry Lewis. As for the food, it was awful, bland and over-priced beyond belief. When you come to Buona Notte, you're not coming here for the food. You're coming here to see and to be seen and that really irritates an avowed leftist and anarchist like myself."
3l-j-ANJL1Rr9t7VFNkyCg,3,"Great sushi and atmosphere! However, their regular food isn't all that great. The sesame chicken isn't actual sesame chicken; it's just fried chicken with ginger sauce on top. The teriyaki style food is alright.  Also, the last time I ate there, all of the waitresses and hostesses were sitting around on their phones while we waited for service which didn't look good. Definitely recommend Room 112 if you just want sushi"
kim6oCWOlzH40ao2uR7hzg,1,"My sister and I went there for the first time yesterday before going to the movies.   The service was horrible.   The place was not busy at all, as a matter of fact there were more staff then customers.   We ordered our food and waited a half hour for the food to arrive.   They served my sister her food and served my 10 minutes later.  The table behind us that arrived 15 minutes after us received there food before we did.   I didn't have enough time to finish my meal before we had to leave and asked for a container to take the rest with me.  It took the waitress 10 minutes to bring the container.  She then proceeded to ask if I wanted a bag to carry it in, then never bothered to return to the table with the bag.  Instead, she stayed behind the bar talking to a male customer.   If I could give this place zero stars I would."

WmfmHDlN5jhrUmGe4WINZA,4,"This a our favorite place to hang out before Tribe, Cavaliers & Monsters games. I wish more people knew & or respected what this place has to offer. In fact if we lived downtown, I know that we would be there a lot more often. This place it right next to the Thirsty Parrot and if it wasn't for the Parrot's patio I know that Wilbert's would be the place to be for everyone. 
Either way this place has an exceptional draft selection 9 times out of 10 for a reasonable price. Before any game, they have $2 domestics and $3 Jameson's. Hard to beat.
Their bar tenders are friendly and when not too busy they are good guys to chew the fat with. 
Food isn't outstanding but its good and fair. And not to mention they are generous on their ingredients. 
But the best thing that they offer is their live music. They always have good acts coming through putting on a shows whether it's a backed house or playing in front of 6 people.

I'm glad we found this place and hope that others realize how special it is as well."
cjnQ0LaYEEd-0KWKqF078g,1,"The worst service ever. Went in to purchase an item, I had the sku, in stock details, etc.  There were lots of Salespeople around but no one interested enough to try and help me spend my money, and I thought these salespeople were on commission. 

After finding the the item I'm standing at the unmanned checkout tills, again no one in sight. Then some Salespeople even saw me, some walked by, looked and kept on going? Are you kidding me? 

OK, so it's 4:30 pm on a Friday but the hrs on the front door state it's open till 9 pm so why let your shift change affect your customer service.

I ended up going to the returns counter to make my purchase because there were five Salespeople behind that desk, the same ones that were staring at me earlier !

Sorry, I'm not coming back for a good long time."

I thought the acoustics were perfect! We were seated in the upper (2nd Flr) mezzanine level and we were very satisfied with our seats. We had a clear view of the stage and they even had two large projector screens on each side of the stage to enhance the viewing experience (see my pics)...

Plenty of doors (at least on the mezz level) as well as very helpful ushers made getting in & out a breeze...The Venetian's self parking lot structure located in the back of the hotel was within an easy stroll of where the theater is located. Kenny G even stayed after his show to autograph his new CD as well as pose for photographs...All in all we had a real great evening!"

It also always comes with like a garlic butter and it goes good with everything. Service is great! Come check them out!"

KFd_TsYpxuOy0XRj9zN7Ag,4,"One of the benefits of traveling include doing things you haven't done before and seeing things you haven't seen. Now, I know I shouldn't be getting excited about frozen yogurt, but this place was way cool!

I visited NC for my nephew's college graduation and this place was within a short drive of the hotel where my family stayed. We were in NC for three days, and trust me when I tell you, all three days we were at Sweet Frog!

The biggest selling point is you can customize your treat to your liking, at your own hand. There's no saying, ""Can I get extra sprinkles on that?"" -or - ""Can you mix the strawberry, chocolate obsession AND the Island Mango in my medium cup?"" Since it's completely self-serve, there's no one to judge what decisions you make. The choices are yours. 

I encountered a great selection of flavors and toppings, a friendly and helpful staff, and an expanded waistline. I wish we had Sweet Frog in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, you can't give someone a cup to sample flavors in Philly without folks taking FULL advantage. Sorry to say but, you'd be out of business in days!"
s8CBlVzt7EUSecW0KEsAuw,5,This is Viva Las Arepas 2nd location and it did not disappoint. Loved this location as you dont have to deal with traffic and pedestrians on Las Vegas Blvd. Everyone was really friendly and we food was great as usual. I had the Pollo Asada Arepa and it was delicious. All there meats are cooked with wood so they have a nice Smokey flavor.  This location was super clean. What a step up from the original food cart.  Keep up the good work Viva Las Arepas.

The Thai iced tea isn't overly sweet. Good and cold. 

The fried bananas are good. It's wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper, fried, has banana syrup drizzled on top and dusted with powdered sugar. The banana is mushy, but a good mushy. 

I'd try this place again if I'm in the mood for Thai while in Vegas."

It was after 5pm when I called and I was surprised they were able to send someone that evening.  Everyone was polite and transparent.  Ray fixed my problem and explained everything to me.  I appreciated his respectful attitude; I look young and often get treated poorly by service people: they treat me like I'm stupid and don't have time to explain ""complicated ideas"" to me.  Not the case with Ray!  He not only verbally told me information, but he showed me how things worked on the unit.  I have great confidence in this company and I will use them from now on!  It's nice when there is a solution to your problem, but especially comforting not to get ripped off!"

It's a small little hole-in-the-wall type of business right next to a gas station so if you're driving by too fast you might actually miss it. 

I got the house sauce and the garlic Parmesan. They were both delicious, but that house sauce??!  
It was so good that I was originally gonna split it with my fiancé, but I told him that he was gonna have to go back and get his own

I placed an order online around 11:15 and it gave me an estimated delivery time of 12:45.  I knew that it would take some time to have our order delivered and I wasn't upset about this.  When I was checking out, their site gave me an option to leave a note or a message.  I stated that if they were able to deliver earlier that it would be greatly appreciated because I was expecting and very hungry.  I was shocked to say the least when our order was delivered at 11:45.  I was very thankful for their customer service."

They offer a variety of italian foods and you cannot go wrong. 

A must order is the smoked Gouda - MUST! 

Last trip, I had the new york strip with Kale mashed potatoes. You get a salad with your meal and it is pretty tasty! 

The owner is great and the service is usually good! However on my last visit, right at closing time the server turned off the music and the lights on full blast. It was very awkward as there was also another table which was large party in the room. They had just cleared our plates too. I have been in the restaurant industry so I know what its like when tables just chill and its closing time but that was not the way to go about it and it was 10 mins past 9:15. I brought 3 friends of mine who had never been there and I felt embarrassed. I won't not come back because of it though (unless happens again :/ ).

They also do awesome catering."

Best spaghetti I've ever tasted (as always). My girlfriend ordered the truffle pasta and it was pricey, but very much worth the $65! 

The wine enthusiast was very nice and made the dinner even more enjoyable by offering us complimentary wine tasting. 

Truly one of a kind in fine Italian dining! Would recommend to everyone who enjoys delicious eats, hospitality, and great service!"

We decided to try the whole roasted chicken and split it, and then got an order of anticuchos de carne, beef marinated kabobs, in a special pepper sauce, came with french fries, corn and little salad. 

We were given a loaf of bread, and chimichurri to go with it. We snacked on it while waiting. We got our meal and she brought us a basket with different sauces in squeeze bottles. One really hot, one slight less hot, ketchup and one for the salad. We then were tempted by the carmel crepes, yummy goodness served warm, covered with powdered sugar. It was wonderful. 

Overall, a good meal, light, not too heavy, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere pleasant. I think it would deserve a revisit."

Most recently the  young gentlemmen who mostly served are gone and a rude middle aged unfriendly lady is always there....she never smiles and throws the food at you and since I mostly order the best chicken noodle soup on the planet... it spills over and soaks the crispy bagel chips which pisses me off...PLEASE bring back the nice pleasant service and invest in good booth seats....
y1nu5PvX6MkU91TI1GxeQg,2,"I wanted to like this place because they had good reviews. But my experience was not that great. First I had an older man helping me and he was just too aggressive. I didn't even get to finish my sentences. I tried to explain that a had a couple nails that had broken and the rest were longer, instead of listening he just started cutting them. Then he stopped, and a young lady took over. She was nice, but I was really dissappointed in the lack of massage. I got like a 5 second massage for each hand. I was looking for a little relaxation and didn't get that. The older guy kept saying how busy it was, but there was no one waiting longer than a couple minutes - I think there was time for an extra 5 minute massage per hand. It's not like their prices were lower than a spa where they would have given a massage for 30 minutes."

b7TNNG28KBqCrtNr_C0eqQ,2,"So there's this karaoke rent-a-room and sing with friends type place that's been around forever - everywhere in the world it seems but just recently started up here. Or at least as far as I'm concerned - I'm always late to such parties. There's this place called August Karaoke Box (八月恋歌) in Tempe on the south side of University between McClintock and Rural - more specifically in the mall at University @ Dorsey that has businesses like Republic Ramen. You basically pass Republic Ramen and go south into the parking lot and it's in the same building on the east side of the building. There's also a rock climbing place to the south so it can be busy and the parking situation can vary. 

So... I've been here a few times with friends and there are things I like about it and things that I am not particularly pleased with. I'll break it down for y'all...

Pros:

1) During the weekdays of Monday through Thursday before 8 pm you pay 15 bucks an hour. That works out pretty cheap if you come with friends. It's usually not crowded in the afternoons at all. 

2) You get a private room so nobody sees you singing except for your friends if you're the shy type and are mortified about the idea of singing in front of people. This also allows you to try out songs you normally wouldn't dare without any embarassment when the song becomes a trainwreck. 

3) These rooms allow you to have a private party for as long as you like and are willing to pay for. 

Cons:

1) Catalog - I understand that the reason this KTV place even exists is the Chinese speaking clientele - which is why I wasn't too surprised when the receipt I got after paying was almost all in Chinese characters. That said they could use a much bigger English language artist catalog. It's funny that the Rod Stewart and Bee Gees song catalogs are much bigger than the Beatles catalog and there isn't any Rolling Stones at all that I could find. Nor could I find any Eagles. Or Led Zeppelin. Been here a few times and I can see the novelty fading pretty quickly after going through all the available songs that I like/know. It might be my lack of Karaoke GUI navigation skills but I searched by artist and looked at all the offerings for each particular artist. What's weird is you can type in songs by name and they sometimes come up even if the artist isn't listed in the artists section. Oh well. 

2) The way the lyrics show up on the screen are usually two lines at a time. During faster paced songs the transitioning of the lyrics to the next pair of lyrics can sometimes be slow enough that you can be caught waiting/wondering what the rest of the lyrics are (if you don't know the song too well). Most karaoke bar type setups have a full screen of lyrics at a time to avoid that. 

3) The backing tracks/video. So some of the songs have the actual music video or live video of the artists playing their songs. Some of them have some weird Chinese videos of women walking through the street but having nothing to do at all with the song itself. Awkward. But some of the audio tracks sound like MIDI - like you're listening to an old school arcade game rendition of that song. Fortunately not all songs are like that.

If you're a karaoke fan this might appeal to you to try at least once anyway. As always, your mileage may vary."
RK7WLRv928wX0j611VnoJw,5,"Kinka Izakaya was the most fun Japanese tapas bar I've been to. They had ""sake bomb"" chant-like things that they yelled with the customers who wanted to try and gulp it down. The overall atmosphere was so upbeat and alive. 

The food was also all so good, so good that I didn't realize how much we had until the bill came out (hence the 4 star). It was pricier than I expected and had eaten (small portions for its price). Regardless, you HAVE to try the baked oysters and the cheesecake. The matcha cheesecake is All. That. -SO good. SO GOOD!!"
nJ8xU42XV0w4ep_6SMs57Q,5,"We went for a guided tour of the speedway.  It was pretty much what we expected.  The Petty Driving Experience was at the track so we were inconvenienced some.  We weren't able to get onto the track immediately.  When we did, we were limited but to one pass.  Normally, it is two. :(

Our guide was knowledgeable.  We had a good time taking us around, indulging our curiosities, and imparting knowledge to us.

Everyone involved with the track was warm and friendly.  Definitely a tour to be taken when one is in the area!"
6e1Y0gDpasu7Q-qCDbegYQ,4,The strawberry daiquiri is off the hook. The BBQ chicken quesadilla is yum. It's good and pretty healthy for a fast-food style restaurant.
s1ZZ4TlvxV-7d7FEGTRLVA,4,"Place is clean, order was done fast.. Taste of buttered halibut and chips so-so..."
UEn2qdhtZ4cdvvEyYOgYhw,5,"Dew or Die and Coke O Lime have been my favorite drinks. The oatmeal cookie is really good tho, I'm not a huge fan of tons of frosting so I scrape most of it off. And I was really bummed that the custard was over priced for the amount you get. I'll be back for the oatmeal cookie and dew or die weekly tho for sure! Great open atmosphere inside to hang out and a drive thru when I don't want to take my kids inside"
C7zhjFwOHjKPhVnPVIMbrA,1,"I came here 3 years ago and thought I would try it again based on the high reviews and that it is closer to my home than my ""regular"" place. Mistake. Nothing has changed. 

Made an appointment for 2 pedicures and 2 gel manicures plus a brow waxing. 

Pedicure was ok. Nothing special. Gel manicure for me was rushed because a ""regular"" came in as Gina got started with me. As a result, my cuticles were cut in 2 places and bleeding. Each layer of my gel manicure was not allowed to baked the minimum 60 seconds and as a result my manicure is peeling off in less than 5 days on 4 nails. Have NEVER had this happen at previous salon where they practically over bake!  

Again, pedicure nothing special. And chairs are mediocre in regard to massage action. 

The eye brow waxing was sloppy. Area between the brows was even done! 

The salon has absolutely no ambiance. No music. Just 2 televisions. There are no decorations. They have made no effort to make this salon ""pretty"". It is functional but still charges same prices as nicer salons. Same as it looked 3 years ago. 

Bottom line~treat new customers like a regular and you might have more regulars. Won't be back."
I8lY4T4-qURxq8ZGhcpBag,5,"It means a lot for me to go out of my way and write a review..  Because toddler. Haha, I don't have time. But.. The Wing Counter deserves it. I've been there four times now. The food and service are both incredible. Tonight was exceptional  though. I like extra TWC seasoning on my wings. I asked for it, they may or may not have done it, I don't know. They were delicious regardless. Martez (sorry if I butchered your name) asked me how they were and if it were enough seasoning. I said ehh, could use more but I was NOT complaining. They were still great. Five minutes later, he walked out with a dozen extra TWC seasoned wings for me. THAT'S customer service my friends.

Also, best chocolate chip cookies ever."
E7g6TD3rAdE6S1yHvz9AqQ,3,Three stars was for the food.. Everything else was a problem. Couldn't get any chips seems like they pick and choose who gets chips and salsa or depending on the waiter... Lol...had the peach margarita taste more like sugar with salt and a HINT of peach. Once the food came it was delicious. The waiter was all over the place could of did much better. The place is nice
VJzhFI3DFQVKgwN_49FTdA,5,Best tacos in the Northwest of Vegas so far. Al pastor tacos were delicious. Very generous in the meat.. Pieces of pineapple in it. The salsas are all amazing. My son had a burrito with asada. That too was very flavorful. Beans are tasty rice is a lil bland but their salsas make that better. Will definitely return
DDInU62F4Sfdqrev1BV_4g,4,"There's a Corbo's in Downtown Cleveland and I AM HERE FOR IT! I love the Corbo's in Little Italy but I don't get out there as often as I like, so I am thrilled they opened a new location in Playhouse Square, nestled right before the Palace Theater.

There's a lovely chandelier that's pleasantly surprising and catches your eye right when you enter. The first thing I noticed was how big the space is. I was expecting a hole-in-the-wall, but the bakery is quite large, with an entire seating second room of seats! There's comfortable chairs and tables where you can actually sit down and have a meeting, go on a date or just relax. The atmosphere encourages you to stay and hang out!

Corbo's has a huge selection of everything from pizza and pepperoni bread to donuts and lemon bars. They also have some of the best cannolis in CLE! Everything is super affordable, so just try a few things and go nuts. They also have a coffee menu (which is admittedly a bit of expensive), but if you're a donut and coffee type of person, you can do that here. Really looking forward to the new Corbo's being in my regular rotation of places for a coffee/pastry date!"
Xd-JTZo1YZXkb6fzTXvTpw,4,Love it.  Went for the first time. Slices are huge and the combos are perfect.  Lacking in variety but great traditional flavored.  There are three great New York style pizza places in the heart of the strip.  This one is tied for second best but still great.
1LUKfpBe4ddj1ceSkA2TGw,5,"I originally reviewed this restaurant when it was under old ownership. I have been a couple of times since the new owners took over, and it gets better each time. They ask for input when you get your bill, and the menu has changed a bit since my  first visit under new ownership. 

The selections are great. I love the different wine flight options they have. I have only had a few things on the menu, but the bruchetta was amazing! They have updated the seating area and added a patio. The live music is always awesome, and really helps create a relaxing environment. The servers are really friendly and knowledgeable. 

A few people mentioned high prices,  but I think it's on par with all the other wine bars I have visited. Plus, the food is better than most and the service is great. Love it!"
AvU5UYQ4DOZXG6jbyEb2Uw,5,"This place is Awesome!! Great smoothies and amazing service!!
We had great time there.
Thank you!!"
9fTOPKn2rMDrVlhOXaYUrw,5,"I love this boutique! They have the cutest selection of pet products and lots of gifts for animal lovers. All toys & treats seem to be very high quality. The owner and employees are so friendly and helpful also. If you're in the area, you must stop by here :)

They also hold a Howl-o-ween party for dogs and do pictures with santa around the holidays!"
6A2a2FMNedzKiHTcH17gfQ,3,"Just was there last night. Theatre was good and clean. The service was decent but the food was just alright. Seemed to have the typical bar food type style. I was probably expecting a little more high scale food because after walking in, it just felt like an expensive place. 

Vegetarians and Vegans unfortunately need to just stay away if they are hungry. I would go there again but only if I was obligated to go with a friend. My GF and I had a Groupon which made the tickets only $5 each. We saw the new remake of Vacation which needless to say, was just for a money maker deal for Chevy Chase."
vyBMEl_6sKY10NG9XD36tA,4,"This little restaurant is always busy. You can opt for either their dine in or take out. The food is always fresh and decently priced. Always delicious. My favorites on the menu are; the wonton soup, veg. Spring roles, P1 which is the rare beef and rice noodle pho, lastly their crispy chow mein. 

In the event you stop by, overlook the spelling errors on the menu."
sFACb9sY3zwNYGEEMb3q0A,3,No excuse for luke warm chili. Crack fries? Please.  Cracked pepper on french fries - bfd.  Great beer selection - rating the food only. Not good enough.
VdLt03m6UFaE7TlTDqIk7w,5,"It's great to have  Boba Tea place in the west,  west side.  Thai tea is my favorite and they have not only have a great selection of tea but several great ice cream varieties.  Fast friendly service and great taste."
dIqYbmP_BNiKtPGjrG5yVg,4,"Great place if you're hungry. Doesn't brake the bank and will leave you full upon leaving the venue. We decided to be adventurous and tried their oysters. They were around $3.25 - $4.00 each. Can't recall the last time I tried oysters, but it was an interesting experience. I liked the East Coast oysters, while the West Coast oysters were small and didn't taste as well as the East Coast ones. Their pulled duck fries with gravy and cheese would nicely complement an main (e.g. chicken, stake, etc.) and you can share them, because even the medium portion is good for 2 people. The atmosphere is more of a local pub than a classy restaurant. I would surely come back to sample some more oysters or try a different item on the menu."
iTwDco3S-kHXDOQo6ZA77Q,3,"The course itself is short but fair. We were warned the greens were tough and they were. The starter and guy in the pro shop were very friendly. Now the issue. On number eight I putted and had about fifty feet to get back to my cart. A lawn guy was standing there and turned on the sprinklers. I was soaked on my left side of my body. I yelled over to him and he shrugged his shoulders. Like all places in Vegas they use reclaimed water. They tell you not to drink it or touch it. My left side of my body was drenched. Finished the ninth hole and told the starter and another employee. They apologized but I was soaked. I went into the bathroom to wash that reclaimed water out of my eyes, hair , hands and more. A women named Amy came out and offered me a free lunch or free drinks, I declined because I was wet down to my under wear. She apologized as well. They should have refunded my green fees and helps me figure out how to dry all my clothes. I am concerned about the reclaimed water that I swallowed and that was sprayed all over me"
F7d1g9V1IOMPbXKazmVIkw,5,"Firstly, I am particularly surprised at the number of bad reviews this place has. 

My experience has been a complete contrast to those who disliked it, for example, the food choices here are very diverse and seemingly endless. They make all kinds of foods from different cultures, which is a big thumbs up for any buffet restaurant. The dessert section has all kinds of sweet delicacies, and the drink possibilities are numerous. There are some times where one menu runs out, but it is quickly refilled. 

There is a gentleman who goes around busily putting away the dirty dishes and even singing happy birthday to the customers, my deepest respect goes to him! 

I would definitely go here again! Definitely worth the price!"
5UmYCH9ZM5Kw8SH9PBgqrw,5,"I have been a Mountain Road customer for about 10 years and felt like I should share my experiences.  The service, selection, knowledge and lack of high pressure sales sets this shop apart.  Over the years, I've bought 6 bikes there.  Jacob and his team are extremely knowledgeable about all types of bikes including road, mountain, hybrid, touring, racing and even kids bikes.  I have daughters and they love the fact that Mountain Road carries a woman-specific brand as well.  Mountain Road will go out of their way to help you find what you want and, unlike other local shops, they do not pressure you into buying what they have in stock.  This is simply the best bike shop there is."
t3tM-KyQKpIkrSXeZfpfaA,5,"I love this place! Chirin is AMAZING with my hair! I used to have such a hard time with other salons and stylists getting the hair color I wanted. Now that I've started going to Chirin, I have the exact color I've been looking for! She is a sweetheart and is great at what she does! I would highly recommend her to anyone. Book with her if you want gorgeous hair! :)"
U_NkFoHJHJgYdTMx5GqZBA,1,A young male worker had been very rude to all Xavier students and shows no respect. He continuously gets my order wrong and has falsely accused me of taking the wrong drink twice. He snapped in my face to get my attention and talked down to me. It's super upsetting because I've been nothing but nice to him.
6sBWMx5U-q-9W2_BIc8k1A,5,"5-stars for the recent visit! Just had Leshaun for the first time and she is lovely. I recommend her.... now just hoping I will be able to get her again in the future. She has many years of experience in the high end casino spas. It came through during my massage which felt like over hour but was only the 60-minute. Anna, John, Quan - some of the other therapists on their team that get my request. I tend to try out different therapists because I have an oddball schedule. So glad I have met and added another one and will be requesting Leshaun again. 

Also, this location seems like they stay on top of keeping good folks on their roll call, unlike some other locations in Las Vegas. I appreciate that and that they have friendly receptionists who seem to try to make a good fit when scheduling."
YD094kShmZO86OcM_bHwuw,5,"Michael O'Neill at Allied Pest Solutions came through and solved the horrible bed bugs problem at our house.  He was thoughtful and explained the situation thoroughly, and ultimately resolved the issue at a very reasonable price.  Michael was a joy to work with - he is professional and friendly.  I highly recommend Allied Pest!"
0Z3uLkC_YdRqydHqRNvk4Q,2,"I've been to UB probably a half-dozen times at this point and figured it was a time for a review. First the positives, I love the space - amazing decor, huge space, awesome outdoor patio, giant beer board, and the parking is really convenient too. The happy hour is a good deal if you stick to beer - often you can score some great releases for $3 or $4 bucks a pour. 

However, there are quite a few negatives as well. About those beer pours, the UB takes the stance that 1-1.5 inches of head is a good pour. Well that might be fine when we're talking about a pint glass here - but when you leave several inches of space on my 10oz snifter, I'm not going to be happy. I've never complained about bad pours, but for one bartender in particular there, it was ridiculous. The other bartender working actually came by and took my glass back and added to it the last time it happened, apologizing for the bad pour, so I know its not just me here. Another thing that bothered me is that the bad-pour bartender also proceeded to have a conversation at the bar within earshot of my group about how he couldnt wait to get off and head downtown to get wasted at Chase Field. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think discussing plans to get hammered in front of customers wouldnt be acceptable in a nice establishment. 

Now, about the food. The happy hour menu is a complete waste of money - I've ordered a couple items from there and all are very undersized for the price - nothing ""happy"" about that! The mac and cheese came out in a tiny tray and when i saw it, I actually started laughing - probably about 5 bites of food for $7 bucks? It was crazy, I sent that back immediately. On 2 other visits, we've tried to order the parmesean garlic fries with our meals - and both times they came out cold and soggy in a tiny tray. We tried to send them back once, only to receive the same soggy sad excuse for a fry back in return. Steer clear. I've had a few items that were decent from the menu, the seared tuna and the patty melt were both nice but IMO, this place is just not worth the inconsistent service, food, and pricing."
hTfYPCybIK6y3xK5ZrL2Fg,5,Rachel Rios was super helpful polite and professional. She handled my paperwork like a pro. Thank you rachel for being a super star
4nmI49TrbVfUNgOgLLoRJg,4,"Prices were reasonable great service. Our waiter was a super cool guy and knew the menu witch made it supper easy to order. Classy place, classy food, and drinks. It wasn't loud, I never felt rushed in fact we just wanted to chill and hang out even after our food and drinks were done. Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed this place next time we go to pheonix we will most certainly be going back."
a4cEYlHPCnov-shCGVTSZw,1,"No. No. No. And just. N. O. 
No smoke in the meat.... No flavor. 
Daughter got the pulled pork sandwich. Again-- no flavor. Sauce was lacking full body.....????? Where did this place come from?
I got the pulled pork ""nachos"".... And if you call Nachos--- chips swimming in cheap cheese sauce with little else--- well, then that's what I got. 
The chips were soggy upon arriving home (less than 3 miles away).... Yuk. 
Knowing the portions/measurements now since owning my own place-- I dare say there was 3 oz of meat in them. And that's being generous. 
Pathetic really. They came in that spot and obviously is corporate owned. Why not do it right??? They've got the money to back it. Esthetically they transformed the little location fabulously. But who cares about that?? 
Use some spice rub in that meat--- and salt/pepper go a long way too! 
From a previous visit, My daughter also said the Mac n cheese had no flavor as well. 
Well, there's obviously a market for lack luster, tasteless food and the Falls has hit it!!!! 
Sorry guys. I will continue to make my own food at home that's DA BOMB."
FHeRK0bhSszdyJoeog7GGw,5,"this place is awesome! I got my very first eyebrow threathing a couple days ago at this place. They did really good job so my eyebrow look great! 
The owner couple were very friendly and nice as well. most important thing is...they did a good job and it was very reasonable price as well."
4EeRJXPZPH82Peh9ZFYlog,4,"I highly suggest you get a ""GO room"" because they are newer in comparison. Thumbs up for being pet friendly as well! You can get discounted rates if you and your guest are Total Rewards members. That goes for any property listed under the Total Rewards card!
Yes, Flamingo is an older hotel, but for it's location on the strip + cost = not terrible. I opt to gamble at the casinos nearby anyway. I've personally never had a bad experience with the front desk, security or customer service."
TjrcRswbxX-VCVWjhW867A,1,"I was pleased with the store overall, however I had an issue with a store associate. The ""wine expert"" was helping us locate a particular wine that they did not have in stock. After returning from checking their inventory, we were told that the wine is not stocked and also their competitor (total wine and more) also didn't have it in stock according to their website. I checked the website, and it was in stock. I won't do business with a company who lies to their customers in an effort to try and make another sale. Shame on you Bevmo."
N-L6llqv7F5bTDM08M0l9Q,1,I bought the eat all day deal for $35. I ate the Excalibur buffet for dinner. It was terrible!! I'm grateful I didn't get food poisoning. The selection was terrible: sad looking crab legs and meatballs that looked like they had better days. Save your money for the casinos.
NYoJy6ymyPq7pjXIBv1dZA,2,"Sadly, since this place has been under new management, the quality of the work has declined. I've since stopped going. :("
b8U_BTaPU8v9qtHictpvew,5,"I come to this place every time I come to Las Vegas. They always have something new to try and they never disappoint. They make everything fresh, from scratch and you can taste the quality.  Their coffee is awesome too! The owner and his wife worked the counter and the service they provided was top notch! Seriously if you want great quality gelato and service.. this is the ONLY place to go."
Nno-sbZRiIlkrwmTQeuleg,5,"Loved this place.  Awesome big juice and crispy chicken wings and all white meat tenders.  If you like a bit of spice, have have habanero honey sauce.  Amazing.  Fries are crispy shoestring.  Busy place to prepare to be patient to find a table to seat yourself at.  Worth the wait."
gNRG0K0Xul7xRZIWzVSKIA,5,The food was incredible and with great prices. I definitely recommend the prime rib. It's huge so you can share! Our bill for 2 was only $23.
6Gm2JJlztxz_pJ0WlYuoZQ,1,Don't know what happened! Usually love that location but today I went in and the restaurant had a VERY BAD smell.  Got my food to go and got home and took a bite and it tasted JUST like the smell in the restaurant.. Threw it away.. Will definitely try again but if the restaurant smells the same I'm turning my ass around and going elsewhere!
i2Wd5JzCWWTdKb4aAm4FMQ,4,"Uh....please don't lose that loving feeling. Went in for lunch on a Monday. Delightful!!! I'm a vegetarian. My husband is not. They have a veggie burger, though it's not on the menu. I had the green Chile burger w veggie patty. Husband had the fish and chips. All delicious. The fries are terrific, they are BIG. Our server, Tiffany, was lovely; personable and accommodating. In this area I'm used to either poor service or poor quality food. They nailed both today, great food and great service. Lunch specials made this quite affordable as well. Craft beer for under $5. He burger was less than $9. Bravo. We will be back."
R2giYMgm2aMm-YbxsgOIQQ,5,"I recently (November 2012) brought in a winter coat to Xavier's to get the sleeves shortened.  I've have some bad experiences in the past with other alteration places when it comes to shortening coat sleeves, but Xavier did an excellent job.  The price was very reasonable and Xavier himself is a low-key, consummate professional.  I would not hesitate to recommend him!"
KPQQuEJAvzSE7IptgXPVvw,4,"I attended a charity event here last weekend and I enjoyed it very much. I have not stayed in the hotel yet (as I live down the street), but I will say Flemmings steakhouse and their event facilities are top notch. The location is great too with several dining and shopping options across the street and Old Town Scottsdale a mere $7 cab ride away."
FBwFEBY7kl54WlDWTr1fOQ,5,Love this place! Francesca was very sweet! She teaches me something new about Vaping everytime I see her;) great customer service and she is very patient and sweet;) Thank you momma!!
2UZtq4mpW4Cqe5wMn4omvw,4,"Came here this afternoon during walk in hours and had a blast. I was actually pretty terrible but our instructor was great. Definitely call ahead of time if you are going on the weekend to verify walk in hours. They will let you know what times are not sold out. We played for one hour and it was plenty of time. 
We did not bring in any food or drinks but it definitely looked like we could have brought both and maybe a drink would have helped me play a little better! 
It is located down an alley way. It really looks like you are driving into a dead end and then bam you are there.
Anyways go and throw some axes."
tgooszTMF9e4Gu1qfDfj-Q,5,Flawless work! I had my lowered Nissan 300 ZX towed to my house! Blake was my tow guy. He was careful with the car. My bumper had maybe 4 inches of clearance and Blake was able to get my ride on the truck without a scratch. He even helped me push my car into the garage. Couldn't ask for better service!
xr2L4Xkix-Aj8NhCk7lqxA,5,"Great show for kids.  My 4 year old son followed the story with great interest and was able to understand the entire show.  He was looking forward to seeing Panda! for weeks, and it met our expectations by creating a family-friendly evening.

When he woke up this morning, he immediately commented on last night's show by saying he wanted to help the Panda save the Peacock Princess from the bad guy.  This suggests he had been remembering the show all night.

I recommend buying the cheapest tickets you can find, anywhere from free to $50.  I wouldn't splurge for the $100 seats, as this is a show that even the higher balcony seats can enjoy.

My favorite act was the juggler.  He juggled and bounced up to 10 ping pong balls without skipping a beat, even while walking up and down stairs -- very impressive!

I like how the monkeys get the audience involved by throwing large panda beach balls into the crowd.  And the life-size pandas available to interact with and take pictures with the kids are a great touch.

Overall, I recommend coming if you can, but don't spend too much!  You'll need some money for refreshments, as well.  Acrobatic monkeys, Shaolin Monks, graceful peacock princesses, and adorable pandas -- such talented performers and a great show!"
mA8CI8NWHqli9iIVvEY1ow,4,"If you're looking for traditional greek food, then this isn't the place to go to. But the people who go here aren't looking for that and for what they offer, they do it all very well. The gyro pita is amazing, I've probably had hundreds of them."
WBhGg--QEMzR6ZSDC6MRSw,3,"My Wife and I came here for our date night before going to see Le Reve, dinner reservations were not necessary though we did go on a Tuesday night. They were well staffed, and not too busy maybe 4 other tables in there with us. The restaurant itself is huge! Counting the large outside seating area.
   
      SEATING/AMBIANCE:We were seated right away and noticed immediately the ambiance was incredible! We started by trying a couple of their Mule Cocktails as there was a beverage cart making them table side which was neat. The Mule's were average, nothing spectacular. Then after a time our server greeted us after having had our drink order taken and our cocktails made at the beverage cart and asked if we were ready to order which we were. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken entree and the Beef Short Rib Ravioli along with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese, Mashed Potatoes and a side of Vegetables.  
         THE FOOD was served promptly which is always nice! The presentation of each and every course was immaculate (which it should be for the prices and being a fine dining establishment). The food itself however was underwhelming and we were rather disappointed in the quality of flavor or lack thereof. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was really just Okay along with the almost flavorless Mashed potatoes. The vegetables didn't have much flavor and were somewhat watery. The Buttermilk Chicken was average for fried chicken, probably the best thing was the Beef Short Rib Ravioli which even then I would say was just ""Good"" the best thing about it was it's unique sauce with nice flavor. The portions of course were very small (even for fine dining) and expensive. Need to deliver more then beautiful presentation and ambiance, especially in Vegas were fine restaurants are a dime a dozen.
        THE SERVICE: We maybe saw our server twice and only for a moment each time once to take order and again to deliver bill all other contact was with the the Food Delivery person or Beverage cart attendant. Overall we spent $140 for dinner and didn't bother for dessert because of the underwhelming experience up until then.  The Gelato place around the corner was great though!"
2svXnTOqlWc7tMT2Eay9xQ,4,This is a great place for a Target in a area that really needed a Target. I like this store. I'm glad it has a privet parking lot and is in a very new area. This store seems to have some more choices then we see at the mcnight store or the other north of pgh Targets. The ppl working when I've been their have been so helpful.
MM8X-ekR25nyKCSkva7Clw,3,"The Westgate is a conveniently located hotel/casino, attached to the Las Vegas Convention Center. I was in town for a conference, so this hotel was perfect for meeting up with colleagues and for the ease of going to the meetings and then back to my room to rest up. I highly recommend Westgate if you're not needing to be in the middle of the Strip (not walking distance), and if you're at the Conference Center for business. I would not recommend it as a romantic getaway or as a replacement for any of the more ""themed"" hotel/casinos that Vegas is known for. Westgate is a straight-up hotel/casino. No special frills, no theme, no story, no fanciness. It is affordable and a good idea to say hotel moneys in Vegas. The staff at the front desk was super friendly (which I really appreciate). The person checking me in (at 1am) was great to talk to and even upgraded me to a large room at the 28th (out of 29) floor, just so I could have a better view. It was an appreciated gesture and one I will continue to praise. The quality of the room, however, left to be desired... It had obviously not been updated in years (shades of brown, low ceilings, broken bathroom fan, one of the two heaters was broken and only blowing cold air, rust around all bathroom fixtures and broken coffee table in the living room). Colleagues in other rooms, reported their bathrooms being dirty (I did not experience this). With a little remodel love, this could be a great hotel. Nonetheless, I had a good time. THX!"

I was going to salvage my firebird, but Cory got it back on the road for a very fair price.  This is one of the few places you can go to get work done for your discontinued pontiac.  The best part of my experience is that they made repairs that other Chevrolet dealers could not.  Service was polite and considerate.  I HIGHLY reccomend this business."
j47Gw2FcwoqVHojVjyxkNg,5,"Oh my god. Everyone just head this way. Stop reading this. You won't be disappointed. I walked out of Dream Nails feeling like a Dream Girl. 

I had broke a nail heading to Pittsburgh because of my bags. I thought I would just stop by the nearest nailshop where I was staying. I didn't mind the previous reviews because people are dramatic. I know a good nailshop when I see one because my mom use to own one. 

I walked in and was greeted by a short girl. I just told her I want a manicure cause of my one finger. They immediately sat me down and started working on me. My manicurist was so funny, she is definitely a people's person. Come to find out that she was the owner! Thanks Michelle! She looks young, but don't let that fool you. She knows what she's doing. 

I decided to get a pedicure as well. Might as well right? I'm on vacation and especially since I'm already having a great time getting a manicure. Thanks Tran for offering me a cup of wine. I had two. I couldn't help myself. I was surprised they didn't charge me. Turns out it's complimentary! You can't tell me that hasn't gotten you sold on coming here? 

I got a deluxe pedicure, and I almost fell asleep until Michelle decided to scrub my feet. I was about to kick her in the face. I'm ticklish haha Michelle added some aroma therapeutic salt into the water which made my legs and feet so smooth. She does a great job massaging and moisturizing your legs. 

I even snap chatted her joking around. She's funny. I uploaded her pic via snapchat! Check the pictures!

Impeccable service. Thanks y'all. 
If I can give more than 5 stars, bitch I would."

zmQzUNKrU2vMvT5jtC9q7Q,4,"Fun place for a quick ice cream break!  We visited on a very cold December day, just after Christmas.  There was a power outage in the area so our original plans were scrapped and we headed to one of the only places open, Sweet Moses.  We had hot chocolate and ice cream.  I know that's an odd combo but the hot chocolate was because it was cold and the ice cream was because, well, how can you go here and not try ice cream!  Everything was delicious!  The place has a very old timey feel to it and it was fun to look around.  We are looking forward to returning to sample some more ice cream!"
vOB18ADiMpld8AuZkCvpcA,5,"This is a fantastic venue. Big open space, nice mezzanine for viewing, nice bartenders. Sound was amazing as well. Dua Lipa rocked the house down! But the MOST important thing for me was the security. EVERY security person I interacted with was incredibly kind. I've been to many venues in the valley and they always have these macho bro-ed out dudes that are rude and pushy, but NOT here at the Van Buren. They were all so nice and orderly, I have never experienced that at a music venue. The one 'bad' thing I'd say is the woman who was running the seating on the mezzanine takes her job WAY too seriously and could not be bothered about anything, even when we had questions, but that one negative isn't deterring me from still leaving a 5 star review for everything else. Can't wait to see another show here, I know I'll be treated kindly by the bartenders and security peeps! Thank you!"
SzcGOqaRJtae4rodmKsK8Q,1,"Horrible, c' mon , seriously??? This place is atrocious, 
The whole way across the board , from food to service ,
Just awful , 
Close for a week , get rid of the whole sha-bang,and start over, I bet that your reviews would be a whole lot better!!"
NeJpCNBvXzWPdCHfVecXFQ,5,"This is the nicest hotel in Madison. As a Hilton Honors diamond member I really appreciate the incredible views from the Executive Lounge on the 14th floor. Depending on the time of year and weather, I can have a table overlooking the lake to the east or overlooking the Wisconsin Capital Building to the west. Chris in the executive lounge always has a smile on his face. 
The front desk staff are very pleasant and the on property restaurant is phenomenal. When I am traveling by myself, I often choose to just have dinner seated at the bar. The bartender Amanda has really good menu and drink suggestions along with great conversational skills. 
These subtleties of feeling welcome make returning a pleasure."
W-J6Nubo69y2x5NBJ7YhVQ,5,We were desperate and got here on a Sunday right before closing. The owner stayed late and made sure  our tire was fitted correctly for our drive to California.
BP2r8LIjlIUO9buIKj9PQg,4,"I have been to The Twins Dueling Piano Show where it was a more mellow older crowd just enjoying music and some drinks. This last time I experienced the Tuesday Rusty's All-Star Karaoke in the first hour, the crowd was middle aged locals with amazing voices! Very entertaining with great talent, many song selections, the host of it had funny props like inflated gutiar, feather boa, signs that had ""yell""/""clap""/""cheer"", and there were 3 screens to choose to sing from. The waitress had an attitude but I wasn't there for her so it didn't matter, drinks are a little pricey but still nice fun."
WUJ5wdOAasRel0uHNOoKHA,4,"We came for dinner before seeing Human Nature.  I didn't watch the Cake Boss show but I knew about it and wanted to try the restaurant.  We were early and they were still serving lunch so we ordered an appetizer so we could order off the dinner menu.

We got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.

For our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.

I got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.

For dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.

Our server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.  They have a shade which was partially lowered but it should have been lowered more or we should have changed our seating position at the table so our backs were toward the sign.

A very pleasant evening in a really good restaurant!"
P-FHd5BbsH9xFmn2O4B3zg,1,"The worst shipping place ever.  I shipped an international package from here Feb. 8 2013 and it still hasn't been delivered.  Are you kidding me?!!   This is unacceptable. The service was good and there was no waiting period however, I got their voicemail several times when I called them during their business hours.  Do yourself a HUGE favor and ship/mail from Store More Self Storage just south of here.  They are professional, consistent and most importantly, they are always RELIABLE.  I will be reporting this business to the BBB."
T0DQftpYdPJENJ0TBkyHLQ,3,"Popcorn was good, but customer service needs work. 

Cashier would only give butter popcorn for the check in even though it states caramel & cheddar. She then tried to charge me it when I was paying.  I asked her how paying for a $4 bag turned into $7.57. She said it was the tax. Wow! Talk about a tax hike!"
euDhh0TpLiPgP3icooqgCA,4,"First off, thank you Hayward Tree Service Team!
December 2015 we were looking for a tree service to get an out of control tree in our front yard under control, and saw a Hayward team working on trees in the neighborhood, check them out on Yelp, and had them out to for an estimate, it was suggested that the tree should be thinned out, and balanced, partly because we had been hacking away at the tree over the years trying to keep it off the house. Service was completed and we were impressed with all aspects of the service.
Well here we are at the end of 2016 and thinking we should work more on thinning and shaping the tree in the front, and to our surprise we got a call from Hayward on Wednesday, they came out on Thursday for an estimate since we wanted three trees in the back yard worked on, and a Queen Palm removed. Friday the crew arrived, and the work was completed.
In both experiences, the service was stress free, fast, professional, and the charges have been very fair."
fCfRwzUMb_iZKdX0ZtqATg,4,"First,
Our server's name is Sunshine. That is actually her legal name!.  She was simply amazing, from making great recommendations and accommodating a few special requests, and just being present, she was awesome.

I know this place has a reputation for being crazy expensive, but I had a $22 lunch that included an authentic Caesar salad and a 10 ounce New York strip.  I think that's very good value! Portion sizes were good, unfortunately because I feel really full.

We sat on the patio and had great people watching as well."
qQ7lZ0SalyXGqDTdNZs4wQ,5,"Wow....this place was impressive. We went for a couple's dinner...not celebrating anything special...just a nice dinner...and that's what we got. We made reservations on Open Table, which is always awesome when that is an option. When we arrived, we had time to look at the amazing butcher shop downstairs. We didn't get a chance to stop by the bar downstairs, but it looked like a hoppin' spot!! The host staff promptly took us upstairs to our seats. The place was busy and there were plenty of Echo and Rig staff to meet all the needs. Almost as soon as we sat, the manager came over and introduced himself and gave us some of the story of the restaurant and the Head Chef. (Who recently beat Bobby Flay!). The manager truly seemed excited to tell us about it...he was a young guy, so it was cool to see him so animated!  When our waiter arrived, he was just excited as the manager to work with us and explain the different cuts of meat and preparation, etc. He was able to knowledgeably recommend wines to us. He was amazingly attentive throughout the entire meal. The food was top notch. We all ordered steak...mostly filet mignon which melted in our mouths!!! We had a mashed potato side dish that was delicious and someone else in our party could not stop eating the macaroni and cheese!! Of course we were too stuffed to order any desserts but they looked amazing as well! I will definitely be back to Echo and Rig and highly recommend to anyone who wants a wonderful dining experience. (By the way...the prices are completely reasonable. I'm so used to L.A. prices, this meal seemed totally inexpensive to us!!)"
mGR4-kMt4IQ2BYIvBwBifA,5,Excellent experience! No frills massage at a great price. I injured my back at work yesterday and needed a deep tissue massage focusing just in my back and shoulders . I got exactly what I asked for.  It wouldn't have been any better at a fancy spa ... Just more expensive. I'll definitely be back.
DsyCCoXigfm9Sgar5hZ7Bg,3,"My fiancé and I went for dinner on a Sunday night at 9, first timers, restaurant closes at 10. The bartender was nice, and did a great job taking care of us, so she deserves most of the stars. 

I love the ambiance of the restaurant, the place has a great flow of indoor/outdoor with the garage doors, and cool lighting all over the place. 

The food is okay, but wonder if we came on the wrong night at the wrong time because I wasn't blown away with what we got. The pork posole and the chips and salsa were very good but the tacos my fiancé ordered were just meh. He got the original carne Asada, carnitas, and pork chile verde. He said the pork chile were decent, but the other two were so dry, no flavor, and mentioned the tortillas were so small and no flavor as well. For $10 for 3 small tacos which it looks like the place is known for, just didn't hit the mark.  

We were going to try the choco flan, but for $9 I was kind of worried what we were going to be served, so we just hit up DQ on the way home and wasn't disappointed."
bbFik1s50958djgR_27r3g,5,"Soooo...I gave Dolce another chance today....I can't speak for the Chandler location because I went to the Borgata....but anyway....

I had their signature chocolate pedicure with Laura today...and it very nice...The salon was big and clean...and the receptionist was friendly along with Laura.  I'm glad that Dolce has changed my mind about their company...and while I was there I checked out other services they had to offer......and dI plan on going back!

P.s.  go get that chocolate pedicure.....it was amazing! There was a coffee-chocolate scrub they did on my feet and pampered me with lotions and an awesome foot rub......it was good...and this is coming from a girl who gets very regular pedis!"
VPDPlxvituxsFH9tw7Dbdw,1,"I bought 2 medium pizzas (meat lover's and a custom) and both were received cold, barely any cheese or sauce, and the  toppings were stale-tasting. On top of that, the Pepsi I ordered was very warm. Lastly, the fodd didn't show up until 45-1 hour after ordering when given a 20-30 wait. Never gonna order from this location again."
cvXuCtNXQhNuCDVWgDDRsA,5,"I am absolutely obsessed with these fried chicken wings - move over BWW! You have the choice of a mix of wings with or without drumsticks, and spicy or soy garlic sauce. The way they prepare the chicken makes the skin so crispy but at the same time removes the inner layer of fat and maintains the juiciness in the meat. We also tried a couple of other items today (Japchae clear noodles and marinated ribeye Korean tacos) which were also very good. The ambience is casual and laid back, the service friendly and fast."

3FgXMquOC1Z2E0L_8Lnm3A,5,"By far, the best moving experience ever! Whenever I called the office, Kyle was always courteous, professional and very helpful answering my questions (of which I had a few!). He kept me updated as to the approaching date of my appointment, and on the day of my move, he phoned to let me know the movers were on their way. The movers, Michael and Garrett, were friendly, professional and hard-working--they never stopped until all my belongings were loaded. Customer service, communication, packing and loading, professionalism--everything gets 5 stars from me! Thanks for providing superior service, Pearson Moving!"
N0-yF0uNWzDq73mDF-affg,1,"I'm not sure how these guys stay in business....I called twice for a quote and the person who gives quotes (apparently there is only one person) was not there.   They asked me to leave my phone number, which I did, but never got a call back.  If this is reflective of their metal stripping service, don't expect much."
6zF5Czk018GXo9pgfO-vDQ,3,"I've been to the one in mt. Lebanon and always enjoyed the food so I went here with dad and sister for lunch and enjoyed it just the same. Good food, for a chain. No complaints. Had the lamb wrap. Good as always. Juicy and perfectly cooked.  Had the hummus and pita for an app. Good too. Only complaints are, as always, the foil wrapped wraps are a little tacky and fast foody. I've never liked that about this place. Also, the service was a little off. The hummus app was brought out, but it was just the hummus; no pita. That did come eventually without asking but still, it's like ordering vegetable soup and bringing out the vegetables and then a few minutes later, the broth. Then the server didn't come back for a very long time to take our food order so we ate the hummus and pita with our menus in the way for while. Then after our order was taken it took a while for the food to come out. Everything else the rest of the time went fine. Maybe just an off day."

3LIbKNUU-MEs4ckmsQtgww,4,"Food was a bit skimpy considering how incredibly expensive it was but it was still delicious. Service was just Ok and tables were so close together it felt awkward to attempt  a personal conversation with my mother with groups of strangers so close, but still it's a lovely place with comfortable chairs and a nice atmosphere and fresh food. Piece of advice though,  if you're looking for sushi their selection is scant so I wouldn't suggest it, but if you want uniquely cooked food and have plenty of money to spend, thus is the place to be."
W8Pvop7iCDX8AKdT55_5pw,3,"I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern food so I do tend to eat in this genre often. 
The place is kind of small in my opinion, the service is a little bit slow. There was only 1 server working when I went and most of the tables were full. Clean and nice restaurant though. This isn't the best Middle Eastern food restaurant around but it is decent. The prices are reasonable for pretty big portion of food. 
Food isn't bad but it wasn't great. I tried one of the mix combo that had gyro, chicken and something else I can't remember. Gyro and the missing meat were okay in my opinion but the chicken was pretty great. I really like eating rice and yogurt so I do tend to use a lot of yogurt. So the problem I ran into was they're a little bit stingy on giving me more yogurt even though I have to pay like $1 and some change for 1/4 of a yogurt scoop. Anyways, the food was decent enough to make me full but I wouldn't be craving their cooking anytime soon.  I probably wouldn't come back just because I know there are better Middle Eastern food places around the area."
NAThEYR-MJewJVxJ11n-Hw,4,Great location as it is next to Target. Around the holidays they do 2 for 1 holiday coffees. Definitely a good stopping point.
Rfl5myCyZqwKCz8xYhIUsQ,3,"So excited for a place dedicated to sweet treats, ice cream and soda!  Cleveland is definitely lacking in places to go for a sit down dessert.  
I will have to say though, I wasn't overly impressed.  My sundae was good, but nothing to write home about.  For $6 I expected something to write home about.  Also the coke from my date's coke float was warm.  That just annoyed me."

bf2xRsX6sTMb4Wj-g2l7tA,5,"We had a beautiful day at the Wrigley Mansion. It was a rainy day, so being from Chicago, we were just going to take a quick look around. The AM manager Damien was a wealth of knowledge who joined us at moments to teach us about what we were looking at. We really appreciated his love of history and his excitement transferred right to us. We then decided to stay for happy hour and Stacy was the sweetest addition to our day. We are so grateful to have spent our cousin's day in such a beautiful welcoming place! Thank you!"
17ZhH1ho9RpGSgbd0qm3sQ,3,"I've been to Flo's numerous times over the years, but there seems to be a downward trend.  It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...

The Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...

Now I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!"
hxGA--fsvYuT1-VFQm0S6A,2,Burgers are good.  But on the whole the menu is boring and the servers are not hot enough to be that damn rude.

sbuzStnfH78fqPIrsPHpug,1,"Visited for the first time on Wednesday, Oct. 10.  Three barbers on hand so the wait was very short.  The cut and care received were first rate and I have difficult hair to cut - stiff, thick Asian hair.  The barber did a masterful job.  The result was greeted by high praise from the severest critic - my spouse."
4vPeHVJMOf9OJr8Le0peIA,4,"Although we modified our entrees to have the pickles on the side and they came on our sandwiches, the service could not have been better. Jacqueline confirmed that we weren't driving before serving us two margaritas and a pitcher, and the spicy barbecue is definitely the way to go. The sliders are not sliders. They are full sandwiches, easily split between two of us. We did not split one meal, though. The two of us were the perfect amount of uncomfortably stuffed after our two sandwiches; they were delicious."

Seth put so much work and love into my tattoo in memory of Chester Bennington.... it's not only stunning to look at but incredibly personal.

Thank you so much!!!"

Shitty beers charged 4x their worth but their cocktails are strong and pack a punch! Waiter was super nice and engaging and made sure to keep the waters full of everyone in my party. Around 8 they have live music which is pretty awesome. 

It's definitely worth checking out to just get a drink with someone and relax and enjoy the breath taking views!"
z5NdwidZJCXyiH0cSuXJrw,1,"Tired this place out for the first time and sad to say I'm disappointed. There was no reason for the undeniably slow service as there was 2 waiters and a busser serving 3 small parties and 1 large party. The waiters were nice but you can tell they did not know what they were doing as they were serving out incorrect orders and sent one of our items to a neighboring table. I had the char su ramen with thick noodles and my fiancée had char su ramen with thin noodles. They did not refill our drinks and we had to ask numerous times only to be forgotten again. The menu selection is not extensive and if you cannot tell the difference between thick noodles and thin noodles then you probably should not be working there as my waiter had no idea ! It is not the kitchen's job to check to make sure the food is ok, it is the waiters job. The only good thing there was the takoyaki but the chicken karaage was way over cooked and not tasty at all :/"
6H24SXlhw0u0mLHRLNPf4g,1,"Been looking for a go-to thai spot since we moved out here from cali and in the 6 months we've been here, we have found ONE decent place...this is NOT it. Service was great, and the space was nice-which are soba bun's only saving grace, everything else fell flat. Perhaps our standards are higher given the countless thai restaurants we were fortunate enough to be surrounded by... but even the worse thai spot we'd been to in cali was better than this. The food wasn't bad, it just wasnt very good. 

Like many, we use pad thai as the standard in determining if a thai spot is worth a second try, even if everything else ordered may be less than stellar...if the pad thai is solid then--well done, we'll most likely give it a second go if in the area..but even that wasnt up to par to the worst in cali. The noodles were wrong, didnt have that stickyness one often associate with pad thai and flavor was so-so, not bad but not good... So disappointed, had high hopes and was let down. We also ordered the papaya salad combo  with chicken and sticky rice which  we were super excited about, not many have such a combo, even in cali...but the sticky rice was NOT sticky, papaya salad was so sad. Totally lack luster, no flavor-not even mild (which is usually our complaint-love that burn your tongue spice) it was just bland. The chicken...wow, the chicken, dry and flavorless, didnt even come with peanut sauce or any for that matter. 

Then, there was the thai tea...free with a check in--and even still...never again--watered down, and just sweetened to mask the lack of tea...why?!?!...ah such a sad day for thai food..."

Ok, we will wait for another table. We go to the bar and are sat less than 15 minutes later. We ordered dinner and out of the blue, to say sorry for the initial mis-quote on the time, we were given a burrata board.  
We eat out a few times each week and lately the service has been lacking, not at Grassroots.  The food and service were wonderful. We will definitely be back!"
XIPAesHbhqOWonjWO3aeRg,1,"Despite the fact that Garcia's quoted me a higher price for the same windows, I was going to go with them based on the high Yelp reviews. Well, maybe Garcia's treats their existing customers nicely, but they certainly treat their potential customers like complete garbage. I reached out to them a few weeks ago to get a quote for my windows. They texted me that they would get back to me later, then eventually sent a quote via text (all of my interactions have been via text. Um... okay). After a few days, I told them I would like to proceed and would they please come over and look at my windows. They said they would be able to come the following week. 

They never came nor did they tell me why they never got back to me. So I texted them today asking if they were ever coming or if I should look elsewhere. They texted me back seven hours later that they now have a big job in Casa Grande that will take a month. Thanks. Buh-bye. 

It's clear my small job isn't worth the time of Garcia's, but it's still possible to use manners and not waste people's time. I am now a couple of weeks behind on my window project, fixing the stucco, having my house painted afterward, which puts me going into hot weather--all because Garcia's didn't have the consideration to tell me from day one that my job was too small for their time. Thanks."

I've only been there two times and I've ordered that sandwich both times and it's very good. Money is fair on the pocket in terms of price. You get can 2 good beers, a meal and a appetizer for around about $25 not too bad. I enjoy the atmosphere, it's nice to get out. And the people are friendly too. Just make sure you have plenty of napkins for this burger/sandwich!"
LzMIykw9XvPJyAxTL6KbvA,4,"As I was staying at MGM and didn't want to schlep all over town in 99 degree heat, Fiamma seemed like a good choice, and it was. Great food, great service, and a nice classy atmosphere. it was expensive, but you get what you pay for, I was surprised at the lack of customers on a Friday at 7:30PM (prime time dining) we were the only people at the bar and the dining room was about 3/4 full. We had calamari and Steak Tartar which was good, but the Lobster Gnocchi and Beef Tenderloin were fantastic. I would definitely return"
eFRWfLfR6YsbG2wXjnAnbQ,1,Really weird here. Never did get to eat here because they wouldn't let me alter my meal . I ordered a special salmon plate the would have allowed me three scoops of salmon. A bit weird in itself so I asked if I may exchange a scoop of salmon for a scoop of avocado. They said no. I pointed out to them that the pictured item showed the dish containing the avocado and they told me they haven't had a chance to change the board and that an added scoop of avocado would be 1.50 extra. I tried to reason with these  people and they asked other managers if they could and the manager refused also. I mean really a scoop of avocado cannot be any more expensive than a scoop of what the counter guy said was wild salmon. So then why not make the change and satisfy me. The guy said I should try to work with him and I explained that I was the customer and he should try to work with me. They wouldn't. Enough said. Never again.
1YJdGDnOYffnywykb74plw,4,"St. Francis, you have a new fan! Went here last night for our monthly Supper Club dinner and enjoyed every minute (we spent a good two hours here).

We reserved a table for nine at 6pm and were seated by 6:15. We ended up with a large table in the corner near the kitchen. The table had a mix of four chairs and two long benches, so that was interesting (table was sort of too high though). Three in our party couldn't make it, but that was a blessing in disguise because it afforded us the chance to spread out and be more comfortable. 

The restaurant's design is a mix of modern, trendy and rustic (brick walls and benches) that blended nicely together. Loved the ambient lighting - very cozy and romantic! This is a great place for dinner and drinks with friends (inside) and for a date (patio area). 

Our waitress Meschelle was one of the best servers I've encountered at any restaurant. She was very attentive to our needs and knowledgeable about the food and drink options; her suggestions were spot on. 

To start, we ordered a bottle of the Clean Slate Riesling ($35, a white imported from Germany), the parmesan risotto ($10) and the baked goat cheese ($10). I loved the Riesling - it was light, crisp, slightly sweet, and very smooth. The BCG came out first - the crostini was too hard and the baked goat cheese, pesto and tomato sauce was too tart. The risotto was plated nicely and tasted even better. I loved the caramelized brussel sprouts, cippolini onions and the slices of cajun ham; each bite was lovely. One of the gals said it was cooked too al dente for her, but it was fine to me. 

Next we ordered a bottle of the Catena Malbec ($43, a red imported from Argentina). The wine is a beautiful, deep red with a full-bodied, smooth flavor - which went well with my entree (the prime hanger steak, $24, cooked medium well). The others ordered the Moroccan meatballs ($15), pot roast ($19), roasted chicken ($17), and two of the roasted salmon ($22 each). My steak was served on a bed of whipped (mashed) potatoes, veggies (arugula/sliced boiled potatoes/slices of artichoke) and topped off with a red wine sauce. Other than the boiled potatoes being too al dente, my entree was SO GOOD. (I think the steak would have tasted better if I had it cooked medium.) I tried a bite of the Moroccan meatball, pot roast, and roasted chicken; all tasted great! The pot roast was so tender and full of flavor; the best pot roast I've tasted thus far. This will be my entree of choice when I visit again. Everyone gave the food two thumbs up.

Next we ordered a bottle of the Hullabaloo Zinfandel ($39, a red from Napa Valley). The wine is a beautiful deep red, but too full-bodied for my taste - especially since we're moving on to dessert. I wanted to order the Moscato to go with dessert, but was outvoted - wah, wah. We ordered the chocolate spice cake ($8) and cheesecake in a jar ($8) to share. Although the spice cake was presented beautifully, and was served with maple pumpkin gelato, I was not sold. The initial bite of the cake was full of chocolate flavor, but then the spice hits the palate and it was too strong. However, the cheesecake in a jar was AWESOME! I tried only one bite, but savored each burst of flavor. What made the cheesecake great was the almond crumble.

Our bill came to $297, not inclusive of the 20% gratuity we added to the bill. Not a bad price to pay for great food, great wine and quality time with friends. ;)

Thanks for reading my mini-book Yelpers!"

Trinity again has helped us tremendously with so much patience. I really appreciate it. My boyfriend can be very picky. 

She has been absolutely the best and she's very quick with all the answers we need. She's been on point and have given us many options to work with. 

Thank you so much for all the help! We will definitely be back for her when my boyfriends dad gets his car and when I get mine.


Also everyone here has been super awesome with any questions we have. We are well taken care of here at this CarMax."
3j6Gs9vteym4b3GLotp5FQ,1,Worst service and the girl at front tonight and a huge attitude!! Already had to wait over 1hr and then to deal with a rude person.
82Nb_VxM0d-r9frSFZ3cww,4,"The place is very simpler than I expected (not a lot of space, no tables) and I did not like of some bleach odor I could smell on my visit. However, I give 5 stars because the right ice cream ingredients when combined gives you a great experience: delicious, huge and messy. 

One of the best and unique ice creams I ever had. I recommend you to give is a try."
m2dddfyg8gfOz6feCI6PbA,3,"Incredible 5 star food, but the wait was too long and staff inattentive.... and there was only one other couple in the restaurant when we visited. The food was truly amazing, otherwise Id give it a lower score. Id go back again, maybe it was an off day. Everyone deserves a second chance."
oowz0cVXGbZWWqQV2JUGLw,2,Fairly overly priced for the place.  The burger was salty.  Service was good at the bar but I would not return.  Take a bit more time and check out another bar.
gO4pFf7Ehb42DcdSTT-ESg,5,"Loved this place! I was being really indecisive about what I wanted to drink at the time and just told the bartender what I liked and didn't like. He took the challenge and had fun with it and created the most delicious whiskey drink I've ever had. Just wish I knew what was in it so I could attempt to recreate. Prices aren't terrible considering its Vegas. Well worth whatever I paid. It's a tiny place, so go on a nice day and sit outside. It's an old storage container, so just a cool vibe all around. I would recommend this place to anyone."
YOnI4nhO_oC5lN2kqpBnpw,4,"I've been hearing a lot about this place but since my wife opted for a vegan food regimen, hitting up a place with counters of steaks and a menu focus on meat is going to make for a difficult date night. So when I was in the area on my own, I popped in for lunch.

Nice menu with, of course, a lot of meats. I chose the store-made pastrami sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Grilled on rye bread, the meat was tasty and the bread was crispy. Maybe a little greasy, but that's to be expected.

The mac & cheese was excellent. I'm not sure what cheese they put in there, but it was creamy and tangy with a little bit of bite to it. Also a little oily at the bottom and that's also to be expected.

Service was good, the speed of my meal was good and the price was acceptable.

Looking forward to returning with a meat eater."
nbbufLT9sTIXH_mM6UqQJw,3,"Came here for a nice dinner with the girls, the service was okay and the food was alright. Didn't get the steak so can't really comment on that, but the bread was pretty good, the caesar salad was decent and what really stood out was the cream of spinach to me. i wouldn't get the loaded baked potato again on the waiters suggestion, it wasn't that great.
Also the prices were decent for Vegas, 10 bucks for caesar salad. My friend got the french onion soup which she seemed to like, and didn't look bad. Another got a steak and it was huge!! They also had lobster and prime rib which I would try next time. I would come here again for steak but the menu isn't that extensive so if you really want meat, go here!"

8WwQK6FpayvUAMa63VfDjQ,5,"That hit the spot!  While we were visiting Las Vegas we had a craving for some good Mexican food and were not disappointed. This place is worth the trip away from the Strip for sure. I would definitely come here again.  Our party had the shrimp tacos, cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, carnitas tacos, and shrimp cocktail and we liked it all!  Prices are more than reasonable, and they cook with soybean and canola oils which made it very easy to eat here with a peanut allergic person in our party.  The staff and management are very friendly and welcoming as well."
jy1rId3qKelRbfmtQXtTIQ,4,"Yummy pizza!!! Very Rich toppings!
The $5  happy hour is a great touch downtown too.
Our group tried the: speck, pepperoni, chicken and sausage. Very generous on the toppings! Rich and flavorful. Crust slightly crispy and chewy. 
To compare to Una: Una has less rich toppings, but is lighter and heavier on the salt. Una has a thinner crispier crust, but can be a touch too hard.
Free Parking in The Core downtown parking lot."
RXcMPUaa-rVPLIjneh0eeA,5,"The new restaurant in the same plaza is much bigger and wonderfully decorated.  Tony and his team have an outstanding job.  Food was excellent as always.  Favorites include the lasagna, garlic knots and homemade cannoli.  Customers are treated like family."

n8_D9BpLFp9dKjFqVrazuQ,4,"This is how Udon (and most Asian Noodles) should be served. Cafe Sanuki more closely mirrors the style of restaurant in Japan where you aren't sitting down for an hour to grab a meal that takes moments to prepare and execute and requires almost no service beyond getting your food.

Walking in, you are greeted by the open style kitchen, a display of their dishes, as well as someone making and cooking udon noodles. You walk up with a tray and order, receive your udon unless it is one that takes longer to prepare, grab tempura with plastic tongs, and choose side dishes if you like. Then you pay for your food. 

Then you grab any of the open tables and enjoy your food. When done, you simply leave your tray in a bussing area (not sure if we are supposed to clear our tray but employees seem to be cleaning up the area).

Quick, convenient, great value. And the udon is quite tasty too. I have had a chance to sample the niku, onsen tamago and the mentaiko cream udon. The beef was very tasty and tender. The tamago is imported from Japan and is organic and vegetarian, and the mentaiko cream had great flavor.

I had a chance to try the miso pork belly rice bowl as well - the pork belly was okay, but I'd definitely focus on the udon here. 

A special note about their lemonade - it's a little creamy and light in flavor which is actually pleasant because it is not overwhelmingly sweet.

One thing to watch out for might be noodle texture. The first time we went our noodles were a little overcooked and too soft. They were intensely busy with a line out the door and it was soft opening so I won't hold it against them, as the second time was better."

She always gives advice on how to deal with my hair, offers no pressure product knowledge sales pitches, and makes me feel so beautiful every time I see her. The salon is clean, small and staffed with friendly people. Go there and see Deanne! You won't regret it."
PGzp0e8rdTF-DzTXM9tmbg,4,"Pretty good food and fun atmosphere in Lakewood. You have to try the appetizer called ""mazorcada"". It's not on the menu, but is delicious: pieces of chicken breast, corn, cheese, onions and crushed potato chips (sounds odd, I know, but believe....it's great!)

I ordered the ropa vieja arepa with fries. For all you meat lovers: there was so much beef that I had to eat it with a fork! Definitely good value for the serving sizes.

Oh and it's BYOB and no uncorking fee! (sorry, I'm from the DC area where they charge for EVERYTHING!) :)"
LTt9tZfJbBiv04jo3MtYUw,4,"This place is small but full of flavors!  The broth are so good and flavorful. Meats are great. I hope they have more choice on the seatings instead of bars set up. For us with little kid in tow, it would be more comfortable to have a family meal on a table or booth. Definitely coming back especially colder days are around the corners."

w5Ufyy7NhQwVc_twiThD-Q,4,"UGHHHHHH I. Can't. Friggen Breathe right now. ughhhhhhh. So much food for so cheap, how did this happen.

Meeting up with a friend for lunch today, he was raving about their Lazeez on the rocks which essentially is chicken shawarma on lentil rice doused on garlic sauce, tahini and hot sauce. As I was lining up to order I saw them slathering on the sauce and immediately reconsidered my options thinking that I could find a healthier option.

After some tough decision making I went with the mixed grill which was about $14 plus tax. They warned me that because it's cooked to order and not simply carved off the spit that it would take about 10-15 minutes to prepare. in addition to 3 different meats (shawarma, a kebab and a kafta) the dish came with either fries or potatoes, a choice of 2-3 salads and either lentil rice or regular rice. That's a lot of food!

I went with lentil rice, fatoush salad (my favourite) and potatoes to go along with my meat trio. As promised the majority of my meal took some time but they gave me my fatoush salad right away so I would have something to nosh on while my friend ate his lunch.

Once I had everything I was actually more than a little shocked with how much food there as, nearly two containers worth of food if you include the full sized salad. The rice and potatoes were really good as was the salad but the real star was the meat selection. The shawarma and kebab were very tender, but everything was slathered in sauces so it was hard to judge the taste. The one thing that absolutely floored me was the kofta... WAW!

Imagine if an oval shaped hamburger and a steak had a baby and was cooked to medium rare? Yea that's what I ate... wow. Wow. 

Doubt this place if you want but 140+ reviews cannot lie, Lazeez is bringing you quality middle eastern eats fast, cheap and delicious!

Eatcrest Out"
nn-l_Udp24ZJeRLa7eHl1A,5,"Wendy's is a fusion-type place with a great and varied selection, but I've come to love one of the more authentic Chinese dishes! I came here with a tutoring student a year or so ago and she knew Wendy from another establishment, and I've been going back whenever I can since. I live a bit far from the location but if I can put up with the drive it can't be beat. Everything I've had here has been excellent! The only complaint I've had was actually from my aunt, who just can't seem to find Singapore Noodles to her liking here in Las Vegas. My favorite dish to get is the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce but I've also gotten to a point where I won't eat chow mein from any other restaurant because I like how Wendy's Noodle Cafe does it the best.

Also, this might sound funny since Wendy's is primarily Chinese/Cantonese cuisine, but I hadn't found an appreciation for kimchi until I had it here with their grilled beef short ribs.

Customer service here is great, especially considering how busy it can get in the evenings. Everyone is friendly from the owner to the staff and they're really sweet about putting up with me since I drink water by the gallon whenever I eat, so kudos for that. I always get a funny look when I order dishes without bean sprouts (I've had traumatic experiences with them, I'm sorry!) There are always complimentary peanuts (that I swear taste better than any peanuts I've ever bought? Where do I get these peanuts??) and people checking in on you, even when the restaurant is a bit busier. The place is clean and has a great atmosphere, and there's a TV typically playing music shows from China/Hong Kong or Korean music videos that are quiet enough to complement rather than interrupt your meal.

I highly recommend the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce - and ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're a fan of the taste like I am. The Korean-inspired BBQ short ribs are a good deal for their price and I honestly order all the more customizable dishes here (like noodles and rice) with chicken because it's perfectly juicy and tender and I've never encountered so much as a bite of gristle. The complaints about things being under-seasoned in other reviews are valid--I've had my share of more mild dishes here than I'm used to, but considering I can just ask for more sauce on the dish I'm obsessed with, it's never bothered me. Plus, I've got heart problems, so the less salt the better!"

2RrQKo9rPDI2Tvs2aCAJiQ,1,"A restaurant that has gone steeply downhill...

It's been roughly 2-3 years since I have been to lidias, an experience in which I remember having decent food and service... Tonight was far different.

Overall, let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated. Colors and decor seem boring and out of style. I didn't get that warm feeling I should in a place where there are white clothes, $12 average glasses of wine (like come on - I looked up the crappy bottle it came from) and waiters everywhere.

The service was horrible. From hostess crew to the bar to the waitress, it was bad. The hostess forgot about us, then when I reminded him we were waiting (40 minutes - despite a reservation), to which he said ""oh yes, I was just going to get you""... But he wasn't because we stood there a few minutes while he set the table. Rude.

Did I mention the service was bad? Well, while we were waiting we had a glass of wine each (a steep $13.50 glass each - definitely didn't live up to my expectations). The bar staff wasn't concerned with us and weren't friendly at all. They were chatting to themselves and basically ignoring us.  When we got to the table, it took 10 mins to meet our waitress. Then it took another 15 to order.  Then 50 mins to get our food!!! I had the pasta trio (remember this meal takes no time to cook  - as this is ready made and constantly being served) and my wife had the porkchop. Honestly, we typically enjoy our restaurant food (just read my Casbah review) but our food was really just so-so. My wife's pork chop was fatty and over-cooked (despite the waitress specifically making note of how the chef prefers to cook it medium). My pasta was decent, which I ate, and requested seconds (which is allowed for the trio because they give you very small portions).... However, seconds never came. Waitress didn't even know until I told her politely. Then she blamed new staff working the pasta routes... No good enough reason for me - sorry. 

Then the bill.  I ordered the pasta trio for $23 and the waitress asked me if I wanted to upgrade my Salad for $2, to which I approved. However she charged the $36 pasta trio (which comes with desert). I told her this was a mistake and she agreed and ran back with a new check. Now I had a $10 salad and $23 pasta trio. I was expecting $23 +$2 salad upgrade. Nope. So I explained to her politely that I ordered the $23 trio to which she (must have) mistakenly offered me an upgrade. I accepted. However I was told I was wrong and she didn't offer to make this right. Ugh. Seriously you want to fight me on it? Especially when I know I was being appropriately (not like I was trying to score a free meal). Isn't the rule ""customer is always right""?

Finally, we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined. How many people did we see in tie-dye shirt or wearing hats (literally wearing hats at 8:30pm in a fine dining restaurant)? We saw enough to know that this isn't the lidias we expected.

We won't ever go back or recommend the place.  As far as we are concerned - there is a very good reason that you don't have a problem getting a reservation here (because IT STINKS!). 

Avoid!"
OxueL0ISL6OhCkSsKnr5IA,5,"Found this place while waiting to get my oil changed at the dealership. Ordered the Rocky Mountain Bacon Burger.

Had a great time can't wait until next weekend"
UA0RdGsguL6BRdygPY-2sA,4,"This place is very close to a 5 star for me. At this point I'm going to say it's at a 4.5. The reason being is that my husband and I ate there over the weekend and ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. On the menu it said it had fresh carrots, celery, and onions on it. Sounded fab! But when it can out it was a greasy mess of a pizza. It looked like they threw some chicken and wing sauce on a regular cheese pizza and called it a day. And since the base of most wing sauces is butter it mad the pizza go greasy we could barely eat it. 

With that being said, we have eaten hear several other times and always loved it! The antipasto salad is amazing. and the Greek pizza is yummo. Their wings are some of the best I've had, and I don't say that lightly. I LOVE hot wings and am pretty picky about them. Red devil makes them super crispy with lots of sauce. If you get nothing else here, get the hot wings!"
mFDFQMiDNd6qUaAlw1vieA,3,"Do yourself a favor, and do NOT order the cous cous. We ordered it upon recommendation from our waitress and we didn't like it one bit. It was way lemoney. I'm not sure what cous cous is really supposed to taste like but it didn't appease me. She found out we didn't like it and ended up taking it off our bill. I guess it pays to be honest in a semi-high end restaurant.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I really wanted to try Houstons. The prime rib we ordered was alright, and I had the Hawaiian Rib Eye which was TO DIE FOR! The marinade on it was perfect but the only thing was that it somewhat charred the meat since I'm guessing there was sugar in the marainade and that burns quickly. Our dishes came with a HUGE baked potato that I couldn't even finish.

Overall, I would revisit Houstons again for their Hawaiian Rib Eye and perhaps some sushi rolls."

3w9ejxfopxRgElUHGkxvQQ,1,I only gave these guys one star cause I had to rate it otherwise this dealership deserves NO STARS! BS is what I get every single time I go there and even after they promised to make it better it still was a bunch of crap. Talked to Ellis who lied and sd he was in the Internet dept cause he wanted a sale and knew I only wanted to deal with Internet dept then prior to that I had bought a car from them and silvino reyes (finance) took forever to close the deal. I went back to sell my car to them because Peter Cornish promised to make things better and still it was nothing but BS!  Don't go to this dealership.

It is Japanese owned, and the staff is very friendly. This was my second time coming here, I had the soy-sauce based ramen this time. On my first time I had the miso based ramen. Only thing I wasn't to crazy about was the pork, it felt a bit dry.

I am a New Yorker, and I felt it tasted better than the high end ramen houses in New York City. Everyone should eat here, no matter where your from!"
laof9CxlOCo1a_4fZ6XcEw,4,"A lot of people don't know it but toronto actually brews some really good beer!  Case in point, Mill Street Brewery. This brewery is tucked away in the distillery district and comes with a full fledged bar, retail store and restaurant. And guess what street it's on? 

Mill Street is basically known for it's ""big 4"" beers; the ones sold in the LCBO. These consist of the tankhouse ale, the stock ale, the Belgian wit, and the coffee porter. However, if you go into the actual bar you'll be greeted by a slew of new and seasonal beers that they only have there. These range from your fruit beers to your stouts to your bocks and Oktoberfests. The variety is mezmerizing and delightful. Be sure to wet your whistle with a sample if your not feeling too adventurous. I know I wasn't trying the imperial chocolate stout.  Can't decide?  Try a taster pack. It's basically a couple of the beers in little cups so you can try them all.  

I won't go into all the different beers they have because honestly they may not be there the next time I'm back. I'll list my top 3. 

First we have the cobblestone stout. I've been around the city trying differen stouts and comparing but coming from drinking guinness all the time nothing really pairs up. The cobblestone stout does though. The beer is nitrogen infused so unless guinness wants to release their nitrogen widget patent you won't be seeing thus out of the bar anytime soon. Upon pourig the stout expect the magical cascading that you usually expect to wait for. The head on the stout afterwards isn't as thick as the guinness head, more like the head on a boddington's. The stout tastes rich with hints of walnuts and chocolate. Definitely my favourite. 

Next we have the stock ale. This beer is a lighter beer similar to a sleemens cream ale (kinda). The stock ale is refreshing and crisp with a nice balanced finish. This one's actually sold in the beer store so be sure to try it out. I actually just picked up two kegs for a party. Yes, we really like it. 

Narrowing it down to another is kinda hard but i'd have to go with the belgian wit. I'm also a fan of wit beers (wit, wheat, white). The wit is characterized with aromas of corriander and oranges, quite nice on a summer day. I actually was hooked on the wit at luminato one year (mill st is known for sponsoring a slew of events in toronto). The beer is served with a slice of orange to accentuate the flavours in the beer and in my opinion is the best part. After throwing the orange in to soak everthing up it turns into this kinder surprise magical treat at the end of your beer.  This beer is also sold in the beer stores and LCBO. I'd try and pour it out to drink it though cause it's fermented in the bottle and you want to give the bottom a whirl before drinking it. 

The bar/restaurant is actually very nice. Large and expansive with a view of the distilling tins. I've been to a bunch of gatherings here and with a call ahead it's great for large parties. 

I can't say very much about the food.  I didn't have it this time and don't remember it from the last time
I was here. Maybe another day.

PS  Their imperial chocolate stout has chocolate from soma chocolates across the street in it. Delicious.  Heading there now."

I made my appointment with Gara, who had multiple positive reviews on Yelp, and by the end of my appointment I could see why.
I went into my appointment with no idea what I wanted done to my hair, so I was a bit nervous about the results. I discussed what I liked and disliked about my already existing hair color with Gara for about 2 minutes, and hoped for the best. 
I absolutely loved the results. I could not stop looking at my hair and the colors Gara had added, making my hair color look even more natural and fabulous than it already was! I was so pleased with my experience at Lando with Gara and I cannot wait to make my next appointment here."

0gTlAWy4v9zXvzCeg0kF8A,4,"Owned by the same people behind Richardson's Cuisine of New Mexico just around the corner, Dick's Hideway was a pleaser. It was really busy during Sunday brunch time, the slender bar/restaurant area was packed and I noticed a few customers leave after seeing how packed it was. Our large group reserved the banquet room which is surrounded by racks upon racks of wine and is centered around a unique copper-like dining table. 

I ordered one of the enchilada dishes, and asked to have one of them with their red chile and the other with green chile sauce. If you get the enchiladas, I only suggest the green chile, though. Atop them laid an over-easy egg, also served with pinto beans and a cubed potatoe mixture that was quite tasty. This dish was amazing! One of their most popular brunch dishes is the Carne Adovada Burrito, which I constantly hear rave reviews on (come on an empty stomach- its BIG!).

Certainly coming back to try their Bloody Mary's and lunch menu :)"

Espresso: Medium

They do offer other variety of beans so I think this is more of a espresso shot spot

1AR4vXP5VYOBLyNaCHBLXQ,5,"This is my dental office. We all should have a place that we feel totally comfortable allowing folks to put sharp instruments and sand in our mouths. That is what I am reminded of every time I have an appointment. These folks make me feel totally comfortable about a necessary health task.

Their new office is beautiful and they seem to be settling in well. They could use a little more warmth (rug? color? lower lighting? fish tank?) in the new waiting room. Right now there are just chairs lined up on four white walls, a magazine rack, and a TV high up on one of the walls. A couple of big planters outside the front door would be more welcoming too.

Although I am not crazy about going to the dentist, I really am quite comfortable here when I have to go in for a cleaning, filling, or whatever needs to be done next. The staff always makes me feel welcome and as if their livelihood depended on their customers - oh, wait, it does. A lot of businesses don't get the ""customer service"" part of their business. Tempe Dental Care definitely does. Smiling friendly faces.

Recommendation:  Good dental care is such an important part of your overall health.  And good dental offices are not a dime a dozen.  There are a few exceptional practices, offices and staff.  Temple Dental Care is one of those and should be your next dentist."
NnxFqTUpDjocSNvRAj7fUA,5,"I bought a 2009 Prius for my daughter and I could not be happier with the experience.  Scott McCorkle and his team made sure it was a great used car, they bent over backwards for us and made the whole experience the easiest car purchase I have ever made.  I totally trust them and highly recommend them."
I2nFPb8_2Bkqwlk3FALVCA,5,LOVE THIS PLACE! The mimosas have the perfect ratio of champagne to OJ (Yes that is important!) and they have breakfast nachos. BREAKFAST. NACHOS. They're fantastic! I used to come to this place 10 years ago and am so glad to see that it's still around! I've only been recently for brunch so I cannot speak to their happy hour or late night service (yet) but it's definitely a great brunch spot!
7P7WzeTCbvZIl6y-GVX6pA,4,"Very good selection beyond traditional Korean barbecue here. Very fresh food and very clean place. Good energy.  

We had the premium meal for two. The food comes real fast and before you know it, you're done. But with plenty of leftovers. Wagyu was nicely fresh and marbled, but tough.  The salad was awesome and fresh.  Shrimp was so so, kimchis were also so so.  Very Americanized meal.

Seating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.

They promote that you get a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp, which I think, contributes to the ratings here. They don't require a high rating, but would you eat a dessert after you show them that you just gave them a bad review? Nope."
7SPP5FqKS0B01rkTh3nrUQ,5,"The Fremont Street Experience is simply awesome.    We went to Vegas just for this, as our Dad wanted to see it.    I had no idea what it was, but he had E-Mailed me a link and it looked quite interesting.     Needless to say, it rocked!     If you are meeting friends or family in Las Vegas anyway, oh yeah, definitely do go check this out.    A technological marvel.    You will find yourself smiling.

So many cheap drinks in the area too.    And if you have a hotel in the area, you can just walk around getting absolutely jack-hammered.  And apparently people have figured that out long before I came up with the suggestion.   :)"

nH-vz-D6vcad_s8vTH0ffw,4,"Tried every taco on the menu there all pretty good. A couple things on the menu are very good. Winners are Cod, Tuna, corn on the cob, churros. The negative is the cocktails are over priced and the Beef cheeks arent really Beef cheeks. (Beef Cheeks are very fatty like bacon and have simular taste to bacon this was way too lean.) Why Four Stars? Great Value Food"
kpbUJB-Gq40o7ObDbt5TUQ,3,"5  for the attractiveness of the girls. They had two blackican (black-mexican mixed) girls that were just gorgeous, slim bodies but just crazy pretty. There service was also very good which sometimes goes down the better the girl looks. I'll give the inside of the physical restaraunt a 3-4. I like sitting at the bar but this place had a small bar and with bad tv angles. It's just designed awkwardly. The outside seating may have been better but who the fuck wants to sit ouside in Tempe in the Spring. Besides that, it's hooters, same menu, same quality. I'll go back to just to check out those chicks. Easily the most attractive girls/women I've encountered in my long storied career of Hooter hopping."

OLEqMo2IJuLRBd6uAwyU7Q,4,"Will Do In A Pinch

I usually do not shop at Ross, however, when I do, I usually find great deals. This Ross Dress for Less location is cleaner and more open than other local Ross stores I have visited. 

Once you enter the store, you are greeted by store associates. Everything is well layed out, with  department signs hanging from their respective ceiling spots.

Ross has a variety of home accessories, from kitchen, bathroom to the bedroom, and these items can be purchased for quite a discount from other stores that sell the similar  items.

I have never purchased clothing from Ross.  However, the clothing selection appears to be well stocked, and the shoe selection apoears plentiful as well. There is a jewelry department if you need some earings, watches or bracelets. 

Ross is a good place to get discounts if you don't mind spending sometime looking around."
MUommHY6I6UqqmG1XuvXaA,4,"I've seen their specials and musicals on television and on the internet and while I thought they were great, when someone asked me to go to the show I wondered if it would be worth the $86 to $186 per ticket to see it again live.  But I was curious about what it was they did that allowed them to literally ""own"" an audience, so I went.

Great choice, there is no comparison between video and live with this show.  And in addition I got my answer.  They do not own the audience but set up and atmosphere where the audience  wants to ""play"" with them and everyone else in the theater and just have fun; a kind of communal contact high.  Good band, funny, integrated routines and a good multimedia light/prop show.  A warning here, they do use bright lights, strobe lights and fog/smoke machines (not to mention, flying marshmallows) so if you have any disorders that could be triggered by this, watch the videos instead.

This is a show your friends and family will remember forever and these might possibly be the last ""cool"" people in America.  Go experience it."
oKitkwJjOzaDdIkXplEa_w,5,"I had a few minutes to kill and since I just left Biker's Bay thought I would write a review.

I highly recommend Biker's Bay!"

wsXqWLokuBVaz2-nlqaOrw,1,"Lost a long time customer. I have been going to Sivan for at least 5 years and has always done a great job, even though there were times she was late or completely canceled on me when I arrived at the salon from Mesa, I only went to her. But this last time she completely messed up my hair and was acting extremely rude that day. Tried to get ahold of her to figure out how we could fix it only to be ignored for 3 days and when I finally went in, she was rolling her eyes and looking at the other barbers to show how ""mistreated"" she was. Will never be going back and now tell everyone about the horrible experience. Loyalty means nothing to them. Wish I could leave them zero stars."
CMPat5c0TfI-ONFFCpcJvA,2,"Although my son loves the bouncy slide here, this place is pretty lame. They have a ton of space here with a lot of it just sitting empty. The staff is useless. Do not go on a weekend. The place is teaming with kids and there is hardly anything to play on so they are all crowded on the slide. The age cut off is 12 so if you have a 3 year old beware, the 12 year olds will literally run your kid over. There is not a single staff member watching over anything, they just sit at the front desk texting on their phones. I actually read the care instructions on the slide itself written by the slide manufacturer and it says the slide must be under ""professional supervision at all times."" That is not the case and apparently there were no parents of the older kids around so they just dominated the slide pushing down the smaller kids and climbing up the slide instead of the stairs. I wouldn't say never go there, but only go during the week when the older kids are in school."

This place is right up there with some of Hakka places that have been here for the past 30 years, better than any of the new joints that try and pass their food as authentic."
ts2OpGGpkPTu2RdlmYhqXA,3,"I have two cartilege piercings in my ears, done waaaayyyyy down south at To the Point. I went with a good friend who got his eyebrow pierced at the same time. He kidnapped me after work and down we went!

The service was alright - we did walk in after all. I took a moment to peruse the tattoo books, and I what I saw was so-so to decent. If I got a tattoo, it would not be from here. After about twenty minutes, the woman at the front asked us what we wanted. We were instructed to pick from the jewelry, which was fine with me. My friend had brought his own in, but they refused to pierce him with it for health reasons. So the actual cost was that of the piercing plus that of the jewelry. It ended up being moderately pricey, and they only accepted cash, which was very annoying.

Finally we were taken to the back. I sat in a chair while the piercer  consulted me on the locations of my piercings and began sanitizing the area. She also had what seemed to be a piercing license, which was good. She used a sterile needle straight from the package. It hurt sooo bad. Once we were done, she strictly instructed me on the care of my piercings, and told me what sort of items to treat it with. All told, it took about twenty minutes from the start of the process to the finish.

Overall, To the Point was sterile and clean. It was alright."
ULGfIH6EV9ANhJERt1Zr4A,4,"Cute place with some fabulous desserts. Everything looked so good it was hard to decide what to get. I ended up going with the ugly cookie which was so good and not overly sweet. I tried a bite of my husband's Monona bar which was good but super sweet. My mom had the mint sandwich cookie that would have been even better with some ice cream. 

Great addition to the Atwood area and fun place to stop for an afternoon break."
VrTIypadrBFDoSgeeJRhvQ,2,"Not that great kinda average actually. I hate the egg rolls that are really thin, like the see through ones. They have those. I got the General Tso and the rice was bland as well as the chicken & the chicken was hard because it was over cooked. All in all prob won't be ordering from here again."

Also, their prices are very reasonable. I will keep going to this shop and recommend others to do the same."
zRbXUO_xFPPEVmQrM6vyzA,3,"I popped in for drinks with the wife the other day. The Beaconsfield was always a place I told myself I'd go some time and never actually made it there any particular night.

We got there shortly after open so the place was empty. Its beautiful inside and gets perfect scores for decor.

My whisky sour was made well (no sour mix, fresh lemon) and my wife's latte was excellent. We ordered a slice of tiramisu for the heck of it; it came with a whipped cream pouf and a coffee bean on top. The next day I was at Costco with my wife and she was looking at the cakes and guess what was there? The exact same tiramisu cake with the little puff and coffee bean on top. The cake was something like $12 in costco and we paid I think $8 or $10 for a small slice. Kind of put me off from returning to the Beaconsfield to be honest. I dont expect most places to bake their own cakes but there's something in bad taste to me when a restaurant uses a premade grocery cake.

Not sure if I'll return and if I do, it wont be for food."
s7vkL7vTvLoz5Hp0WxRRKQ,4,Fun place. Good bar food. My server was great. There was live music. Will go back for sure.
YYqehOMzWn-OsfKfHsSA9g,2,"I wish I could say something. Anything. But, all I got is nothing, because that's what I got before I left the most craptastic table known to mankind.

I never heard of this place before until a friend suggested that I go because they were having their 5 year anniversary special. If I liked it, my job was to report back to my entire sorority so they could try it out on another day and we would be a group of happy fatties. If I didn't, at least I didn't pay full price. My sister and I were pumped to go as it would be a new experience in Old Town. My phone was charged; I was gonna take an ungodly amount of photos of my food. I called to make reservations and they told me that they had limited tables and I would be at a high-top table. I'm not usually one for such seating but I understood that they would be packed so I took it with joy and excitement.

I got there early and checked-in with the hostess who said that my table was ready and all they had to do was clean it. You know the feeling when they lead you to a table next to the kitchen entrance, the bathroom, or some reckless child throwing spaghetti who needs to be tied up Silence of the Lambs style? Well, let me challenge that.

They had moved a high-top table from the bar area into the lit walkway where everyone walked in and out, but pushed it toward the wall where there was absolutely no light. I thought Cornish Pasty was dark, but where it was placed, I needed to turn my phone on just to talk to my sister across the little 2 ft. wide table. You could tell that a table wasn't supposed to be put there because well ... it was a walkway. If a party of more than 4 was coming through, one of us would definitely be bumped into. It only had 2 chairs, 2 settings but I reserved for 3. They said they knew and would set it up, even though I looked and the table was already clean and set? We waited for about 20 minutes and finally hunger overtook my sister who got up and asked if we could sit down. They told the same excuse to us they told everyone else 'We're waiting for some tables to move."" My hopes for a better table soared like an American Eagle, but not another second longer did they shut down my dreams like the government. They pointed to the same table, and we awkwardly sat down ... while my boyfriend stood up waiting for the chair they still hadn't placed. There were at least 4 employees standing at the hostess podium, 2 feet away, just walking around my boyfriend like he had suddenly turned into stone. 

The chair came 5 minutes later, but only because of my boyfriend's invisible yet oh so intense laser beam eyes gored into the back of their heads. No menus were given to us the entire time we sat. Once again, we are sitting so close to the hostess podium, I could play patty-cake with them. Then we waited until our server came, who immediately told us that we couldn't sit there if we were just waiting for a table, and that we would have to excuse ourselves to the bar area. 

That was pretty much the last straw. Not even cheap Chili's would give this kind of rude service. My sister told her that we were her table but we were leaving. I walked the 2 steps over to the 4 hosts who looked baffled as to why we was leaving, but even a 3 year old watching Dora could have figured it out quicker than them.

We left and walked over to HiFi disgruntled, but even there we got better service even with the unwanted boobies all up in our faces. 

Basically, I am appalled at what happened. I understand that you're packed with such an awesome special going on but lord did they over-estimate the crowd, taking reservations when they shouldn't have, giving tables to customers that not even a cave troll would deserve, and the lack of communication between the front of the house and the dining floor. People go out of their way to try new places and if you can't be organized without being blinded by profit, why should we as customers waste gas just to be shafted. We left so frustrated and sad, not even getting the slightest chance to try anything that we had drooled over previously through Yelp photos. Not even a freaking glass of water."
lrWJf2LLnZltq3G3JX3jnw,5,"I love this place. I've been in Arizona 2 years and had not found any place comprable to my nail spot in Los Angeles however, coming here I finally found a place that I can get my manicure, pedicure, and eyebrows done at one place and be satisfied. As some of us ladies know that is a task sometimes to find one place that can do it all.  As far as eyebrows, Hannah is awesome and she follows your lead whereas some places even though you give them direction they want to do their own thing anyway. For manicures and pedicures I've tried a few of the techs and have not had a bad experience yet so I'm okay with either of them doing my manicure or pedicure. And my guy is extremely picky and he too was happy with his pedicure and his face waxing."
_MJrnrlK1r9CQB_BBCcRIw,3,"Quick thai craving fix. Food is OK, not bad or not phenomenal. Thai food in general, it can't be bad since it's all sweetened. Like their cheap lunch special to go, because I am not a person with the BEST posture, but I've never been to a restaurant where it acutually forces me to seat 90 degree angle straight back with my knee hitting the table since the restaurant is very small with limited space. 
Better if you know what you like and get it to go."

8Z-5jLUlwK_DJX_4KhktsA,2,"Overcrowded and not even last years styles, more like styles from 2-3 years ago. Every purse here was really basic and not appealing. For me that is. I guess if you like simple and plain coach bags, this might be the place for you. Yes the prices are lower than the actual coach stores, however, they are still 100.00 to 200.00 per purse depending on what you choose. To me, that is not a big enough discount to warrant buying such boring purses. I guess you can call me cheap but I would rather pay less and have a stylish purse that might fall apart within a year or pay about a hundred dollars more (300.00) and go to a normal coach store and get a purse I love that apparently also is of a better quality. Not only that, this outlet store doesnt have nearly enough employees for the amount of people that visit here. If I had even had a question, there is no way I would have had it answered. It was weird because at the Coach store at Ceasars, the sales girl was a little too attentive and came off as fake. Yet, at the outlet store, the sale people could have cared less and seemed almost rude probably from being overworked and stressed out. Honestly, I was initially excited to visit here but walked out disappointed. This outlet store was not only an unpleasant shopping experience but it also didnt seem like a real great deal price wise to me. Yes, I cringe thinking about spending 300.00 at a real Coach store, however, it seems a little more worth it then still paying alot and buying something that I am really not that happy with at the Outlet all for the sake of having a Coach purse."
85hA_571Z52Kil-mQgSl3g,2,"Brunched here yesterday with a few friends.. I also wanted to see what all the hype was and take some stunning pics on the rooftop with that gorgeous CN Tower backdrop.

First thing I saw was the lovely hostess as soon as I got off the elevator. Cute concept. My reservation not being available til 30 minutes later?, not so cute.

I can't remember how long ago it was that I had to wait that long to be seated when their was actually a reservation in place.

The interior: wasn't impressed.. had a very IKEA feel to it and didn't like our table. The chair looked like folding chairs you would put in your back yard. Ordered a Mimosa and it was in a plastic glass?? Really? Okay...

The food: I ordered a side fries, the avocado toast and a Mimosa. My bill was close to $50 and not worth the quality of food served.

The avocado toast was okay? Lacked flavour. The potato hash accompanied were not fresh but very dried out. The fries tasted like they were frozen or left out too long. How do you screw up fries? Mimosa tasted bitter.

I asked my guests how they liked their dishes and they weren't impressed either. Our server ran hot and cold at times. Their was an older gentleman that finally picked up my plate when I was done and apologized for it sitting there so long. I think he must have been the owner or manager.

The only thing I enjoyed was taken pictures on the rooftop. The reason I gave this place 2 stars was the service, the food and the fact that we weren't seated promptly. I actually thought it was pretty rude that they seemed very nonchalant about it.

Anyways, I came to see and I saw. Won't be back.."
afBXrF2yhVmhbwVzOrlF1Q,3,"Damn you Kona for taking the Pan Asian noodles off your menu. Now there really isn't anything for vegans here. Who the heck wants pasta with marinara sauce at an Asian place? Dumb. Not recommended if you're vegan or vegetarian...pretty much limited to a vegetarian roll. Boo!!!!!!! The service was ok...took kinda long to get our food but I think that was due to my boyfriend ordering the lobster mac and cheese. I ordered an avocado roll, which was tasty...I paired it with gluten free soy sauce, which isn't as salty. The lobster mac n cheese was kind of a small portion and was lacking on the cheese. It did have generous chunks of lobster in it. They use frozen lobster meat, however. Overall it was a decent dish. I just wish the pan Asian noodles were still on the menu. It would have also been nice if the server checked to see if the chef could still make it. Since posting this review, the owner contacted me and told me that they could make something very similar. I wish the server went and checked. Oh well. Kona is still a good spot for drinks and sushi."

I had the steak and it was prepared magnificently! Her seafood had each piece perfectly cooked. For dessert we had the Creme Brûlée as well as the Warm Dark Chocolate Cake. They were perfect.

T6hadCNn3vLWVsKwOzwOpg,1,"6 months ago, I received bad customer service from this facility; specifically from the Office manager. I decided to give this practice another chance so I called to schedule an appointment and I was denied services because I posted a YELP review of my experience at this office. I was told that they will only schedule me an appointment if I took down my Yelp post. Who is running this facility? Obviously, a manager that does not know how to conduct proper customer service. Instead of starting over and maybe speaking with me at my appointment about our misunderstanding, this manager ordered her staff to deny me services and tried to force me to take down my review. It is apparent that they didn't take any advise from my post 6 months ago when I suggested a re-training course on customer service. I refused to take down my review because it was my opinion of this facility based on the way I was being treated. Hopefully this reaches the CEO of the facility so he or she can see how their employees are treating customers. They are the face a reflection of this company, I would hope they take to this review and get it together. 

Sincerely,

u0LzslJ_QR9PxAvi0MwdUw,5,"WORTH THE WAIT.

I know you've probably stumbled upon yelp because people keep talking about this talking place but every time you attempt to come, there is a dizzying line of people already waiting.

Well you're reading the right review because I'm here to tell you, I am one of the most impatient people in the world but for these tacos, I will gladly wait. (which is exactly what I did last night for an hour, so worth it)

First off, they're dollar tacos. I repeat $1 DOLLAR TACOS. 

Here are some things to remember when waiting here:

-The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar.
-You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them.
- Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too!
-You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed)
-Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them.
-The taco truck is located right outside a gay bar which is why they are nicknamed ""gay tacos"". 
-You will meet some interesting characters in this neck of town. Embrace it.
-The horchata is good! No artificial flavoring."
KddStDDB5gUI4B8Hi1l1Rg,3,"Just tried this place. Got 10 amosas for $3. I loved it felt it was worth the price and the size of it was huge. I'll be going back when I need a samosa fixing downtown.

If a company can't communicate with their customers then what service are they really providing. This is a main reason that this company suffer a bankruptcy Aug. of 2017. Payless is a failed store. Look for future stores to start closing soon.
aU3QjhOyoHQ9cfEDKYB2Vg,5,This has been great for my 13 year old daughter.  She loves playing each week.  Her coach has been great and all the other coaches that I have dealt with have been very entusiastic.  We wil be back again next season.
We60u1qCrqHuzqaN855DWw,4,"***Keep your credit card receipt and watch your statement after your visit here.  Unfortunately (like a few other Scottsdale locations) they either over charge (i.e. your credit card receipt says one thing and your card statement says another)  or charge your card multiple times.      

It's Old Town Scottsdale so the 'scene' is typical of many of the bars in the area.  We met up with some friends who had already claimed an outside/patio table for 6, the 2 of us made 8 so we sat at the end of the table.  Service was doing what they could to get through the throngs of people, but we were left thirsty and wondering, more times than not, where was our server .  The saving grace was the company we were with and the DJ was playing some pretty fresh mixes.  [Yeah I am a sucker for a good DJ.]

The food looked good and the menu was unique.  If you are looking for a little fun and a typical days worth of calories, they have these adult shakes mixed with booze, ice cream, favorite kids breakfast cereal favorites and other stuff.  While I can not personally caloric-ally afford the whole shake it may be fun to try if treated as a shared desert between a few people at a table."
6eA1L6bmuSDt1-l5K-iTSQ,1,"Seriously!?!! Convenient, I don't think so.   You don't refill propane tanks on Sunday!!!  You recommend I go across the street to chevron who doesn't refill on Sunday! Then you recommend I go to Walmart!  LAME!  as a corporation F&*K YOU!!!  Why? Obviously you could care less about one person!  It may not affect you now, but I will never return to Circle K!"
As53fDDq-47Uf542g8Rbnw,4,Been here a few times and everything is quite fresh and employees are very helpful. Parking is easy it's off the main highway. One great thing is that they always have enough checkers open. Unlike the one at McCandless. Which forces you to go the self check out route. I like going here after church on Sunday I recommended it
76eI8KqJ9rKzwc5yL6zcEw,5,Our favorite place to have lunch in Las Vegas the mimosas delicious and food are so delightful and flavorful. The atmosphere is the best in Vegas. The music is fun and the service r amazing like I said it's our favorite place thank you see you soon
N7Q_IcnqEVa3VSyb_KKtMQ,5,"Just finished a productive and delicious working lunch at Cantina Laredo at Tivoli Village. The salmon chimichurri lunch special and service were  fantastic. 

I took note of the Thursday night lady's night with half price Margaritas. They have some unique and creative twists on traditional margaritas. Yum! 

Free Wi-Fi makes it a great place for business. Big thanks to the day manager that really went above and beyond in gracious service."
EkWkyvj5BUYb36OcOQSmpw,4,"Had the crêpes today. Very good. I love this place, but service can be so slow :("
tbdyPEFQINuNOdUr7LA1vw,5,"Very friendly staff,good fresh food and quick service I just love it and will definitely go again to this place totally recommending"
TnRrKkzkQDSYrrHu5RngPg,4,"I wish Yelp would allow  a 4.5 star rating, this place is not a 5(close)but better than some of the other places I have given 4 stars to. We arrived for our reservation and we had a couple of additions to our party, our party of 6 became a party of 8 and they accomidated us with  no problem even though the place was quite busy when we arrived. The decor and atmosphere is awesome, upbeat with a lounge feel. They have an outstanding cocktail/martini list. Our waiter arrived promtly to take our cocktail orders and returned shortly thereafter with drinks and a couple plates of complimentary appitizers courtesy of our Hard Rock VIP Casino host. This is a steak place and everyone ordered steaks/fillets. Everything was prepared to everyones liking and we had orders from rare to well at our table and everyone got the prep they requested (impressive). The sides were all delicious as well. Service was above average. My only few small complaints were that the coffee we ordered with our dessserts was cool (barely luke warm) and by the time our waiter came back by to check on us again we were all done with our deserts but he did take the coffee and deserts off our bill. My only other teenie tiny complaint is the menu was lacking much variety in addition to steaks. Don't get me wrong,  I know it's a steak place, but I like to be more adventerous and the non-steak/non-beef entrees that were on the menu looked plain and boring in my opinion. 

If you are staying at Hard Rock this is a convienient spot for excelent dining without having to leave the property. I will definetly go back and I recomend this place for anyone who wants not only a great fillet or steak but a great overall experience."
EyjYe2nhDU1OSBB24dqxXw,5,This car wash is under new ownership. They gave me me a free car wash for the grand opening. Everyone was very nice. All new equipment. I like a reasonable price on a car wash and like the free vacuums. I will definitely return for another wash.
_MGE828W205krKz1UrRHNg,5,"Been to pretty much every gay spot in Las Vegas and everything has been pretty ghetto until now. The drinks were reasonable, music was cool, gogo dancers were hot and bartenders were sexy and friendly. Think one of them was hitting on me woohoo. Definitely the right choice while in Vegas for the ladies."
c6wcDnCtv5NrVThMNnk9jw,5,Love this place for a lazy Sunday. Great creative menu items and friendly staff. Usually order the half skillet and half stack of protein pancakes. But their benediction is excellent too
6YOo0FcxYtubYJUk34T2BQ,5,"Having moved to the Queen city from SoCal where authentic Mexican food rules, I can say that this is the closest you will get to good Mexican food around this area. I am talking about food that is not drenched in melted cheese, canned tomato salsa, or tacos made from ground meat and on a hard shell. This is Mexican home cooking. The food served here and their flavors are what I am used to growing up on Mexican food. The place is a family owned business that cooks every dish to order and they try their best to serve their food as quickly as possible without compromising quality. This will be a good place to try if you have never had a chance to eat authentic Mexican, and the place to go if you are a West coast transplant yearning for true tacos."
odUZdr-bMy-kvc4B5hikpA,3,Pasta was good but chicken with ribs not really chicken look and taste like it was just trown in the fryer.
1fR98ukP9yg06kAG0sh8ZA,1,Who taste good like always very poor customer service went through the drive-through Took 15 minutes to get my food The girl working the drive-through was very rude and said my truck smells like gasand I already realize I have car issues LOL
q4Du3pEsRGpZLL8FQI7_hw,4,"Kensington Market has long been one of the bohemian epicentres of Toronto. It was the setting for the Canadian TV sitcom ""classic"" ""The King of Kensington"", after all. Now that might be in jeopardy, as the locals are fighting to keep Starbucks out.

The car-free Sundays are great: the scale is much better than other local street fests (such as Taste of the Danforth or Bloor West's Ukrainian Festival), making it feel like an actual pedestrian street instead of a thoroughfare that's been closed off for the weekend. It's the best time to browse the neighbourhood, but keep in mind it's only the last Sunday of the month from May to October."
3cFr8Etp5CFTMmne7SFiJQ,5,Best buffet in Las Vegas. Has a little bit of everything and all is high quality for any buffet.
2P_n4LEMlErb95yNlPlwdA,4,"We've been living in the property of this real estate agency for about a month and it's been pretty good. The big things that needed to be fixed for the house (like the A/C, the hot water heater exhaust pipe, ect...) always got fixed within a nice time frame. Our property manger responds to our concerns quickly AND WITH RESOLUTION! He's quite sufficient at his job. So, so far so good *thumbs up*"
pdct4tgFv3YyRlS_h0Y_pA,4,"Bumping to 5 stars for consistent taste and service.
-----------------------------------
Went there again and I am bumping my ratings to 4 star.

The only thing i really dislike about the place is the cramped/loud environment. Everything else has been perfect.

I tried a few of their other menu items like Masaman Curry and Three flavours pad thai, and I don't think Thai food can get any better than this in Toronto. Their Spice level is ON POINT!

Get everything ""Extreme Spicy"" for maximum flavour, their is also a chef special spicy which is not written on the menu but they can make it for you.

Service has been pretty neat too, the wait time estimate they give you before you are seated is generally pretty accurate. They refill your water glass pretty regularly (we drink water like elephants) and the food comes to your table within a reasonable time as well."
aMYy3yOl_02AQwUjSU7tGg,5,"Derek and Mark were outstanding.  They did a great job in cleaning my tile and carpets throughout the house.  They are timely, efficient, knowledgeable, thorough and very persistent in making certain the work is completed to the clients' satisfaction.  I have called upon them to solve difficult stain removal and they truly were magicians in solving the issue.  Many thanks to these professional and caring service providers.  Linda, Henderson"

2NIbksGr0vHWwlJWFtcn8A,5,"We are very impressed and happy that we chose Southern Nevada Dog Training with Mike. Mimi and Perrie have shown a dramatic change in their behavior around other dogs and people. Mike has given us the tools to control their negative behaviors, and with continued practice, become well trained dogs."
HX-oouYYIe6tVL3VMmiNrA,5,We have eaten at this restaurant many times. We have never been disapointed. Their food is awesome!!  I had the Happy Tummy sandwich this last time. I was amazing. Breakfast and lunch foods are All great
uQ_M7Ll2X3IqomThTqGmpQ,3,"The ambiance of this restaurant is great. You will love the calm surroundings. The sushi is top of the line tasty and made very well. The 3 star rating is due to the prices. 2 rolls of sushi and 2 miso soups for $70. I know it's Vegas but in my opinion that's way too much. If you have the extra cash, go with my blessing. Otherwise, hold your wallet for another sushi place. You can get similar quality for half the price elsewhere."
-DJRBPrQs4QDepg_7_9P9g,4,"North York Central is not my local library by any means, but I did make the cross-town trek to check this behemoth out in all six floors of its glory. 

Reminiscent of Bloor's Toronto Reference Library in design, I'd say NYCL is the cozy younger sibling. Also, unlike the Reference Library, a lot more of the books are actually for circulation. Each floor is divided according to field of interest, with whole stacks devoted solely to business, and another level to science. The very top floor is also worth a gander with its impressive collection of microfilms. If you're looking to study, I can vouch for the pin-drop noise level of the upper floors. Plenty of natural lighting and seating, as well as power outlets. The occasional coat trees dotting the perimeter were well made use of during my February visit. 

Super convenient location for those commuting by TTC as it is in the same complex as North York Center Station. There is also a bustling food court if reading makes you peckish (I know it make me...but then again, I'm always up for a bite) and I believe food is allowed in the library's bottom floor study hall. Happy learning!"
HWaqcPXHMFN1cHL8jzB8BQ,5,"Never ever disappointed and we've been here quite a bit! The staff is always friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations. My personal favorite is the Fico Pizza... amazing combination of just-right-flavors. And if you need a wine recommendation, just ask Roger. He's an Aussie Somm and knows his list (he should, he picks it by hand. So you really can't go wrong with anything there!). Great place to have a party too. Thanks, Roger, for fixing it up for us. We had a blast and made memories equal to the landmark occasion!"
fnC8IkpAOt7WCpIwQS_1Qg,3,"Typical greasy neighbourhood Canadian Chinese, but a little spicier.
I usually get the spicy peanut chicken and have been known to sit at a table where everyone orders it. I don't know why I keep ordering it, some of the pieces in it usually taste more than a little off and it's not something I've ever seen on a proper Chinese restaurant's menu.
It's clear that this is a place that caters more to the Western consumer- plates and forks adorn the tables.
Generally exceedingly busy during the evenings, I've found I've tried to get a take out from this place one too many times during the week to find it closed."
294dvxk_3d1uiqj-6hdtKg,1,"Wish I could have reviewed the food as this was our 1st visit.  Unfortunately neither of the two employees we saw could find the time to seat us.  They were not that busy.   

In response to William L. from Ann's Bistro the issue seems to be his sense of time.  You must have been the person that turned their back on us for 10 minutes.  We actually used a watch.  With the 3 open tables you could have acknowledged us or better yet asked us to take an open table in the dining area or in the completely open bar area.   Wish you the best as I do for all local businesses but we will go somewhere else.   I also noted other reviews about poor service.  You should probably take them at face value."
zrEhyEfbyx0h-EWslls9JQ,4,Really enjoy this place good food environment the drink Coktail not too much but the rest great we order the happy hour $50 per 2 person and they brought a lot staff salad miso soup rice and meats at the end they give u smores. We will be back soon !!
Yr9ZAoJH5yNawGthA3OurA,1,"Please do not order breakfast here, food was well below expectations and the service was just horrible. Toast with no butter or jam, had to chase them down for sale and pepper, salad was warm and had barely any dressing!! I'd order and pizza and spaghetti but oh my God DO NOT order anything breakfastherr!! And oh yes...over easy eggs were over cooked.
Will most likely never est here again."
axYwV6k9A2pouy13ZWRNoA,5,"My Hubby and I love to try new places for out date nights, so we chose My Pie on Tatum Blvd.  We were impressed with their cozy atmosphere. While there, the garage style doors were open which gave the restaurant a feel of being outdoors, which we enjoyed. They have a charming little patio area with heater lamps which is enjoyable in Phoenix.   Ashley greeted us as we entered and pointed out recommendations after knowing what we like on our pizzas. Many great choices to pick from! We chose the Pesto My Chicken and the Spicy Butcher! The ingredients are fresh and the thin crust was perfect! Yum!!  They offer a create your own pizza option, so we look forward to creating our own concoction! The team was very friendly and Kyle, who rang up our order was very kind and made us feel welcomed.  We will definitely be returning to My Pie!!"
23_NJJ9Yfkz7GhrZfX0zDw,4,"I recently moved out here, and I'm used to really good pizza from a local business back in New Mexico, but Rosati's pizza blows the best from my home state out of the water for roughly the same price. Try the Chicago, or super stuffed crust, you wont be disappointed because you get to pick the toppings. Plus a lot of really cute girls work there. my only wish is that they had green chili as a topping, but that's my own problem!"
_t0T-y6weQdAyNIFrBe_pQ,4,"This was my first time in Vegas and there were so many places to choose from on the Strip and nearby. After reading numerous positive reviews about the Vdara I knew this would be the spot for me.

Suite was clean! It came with a kitchenette and large bathroom. The bathroom had a shower and tub. Score! I love that they had an additional closet inside the bathroom and the mounted magnify mirror was cool. I just wish the bathroom sink drained ok. It was slowly draining, but since I spent my days out on the strip we never complained about it.

The hotel does not have casinos in it. Score! I won't have to worry about cigar or cigarette smoke. This hotel is not on the strip, but within a short walk you will be in the Bellagio. Score! I like how casinos/hotels were connected so you can walk through in the air conditioned space than outside in the heat. 

This hotel is a 4 star 4 diamond hotel. This was a very nice and clean hotel!  They have security around the elevators. They ask that people flash them their room key so just anyone walking in can not go up to the rooms. Be sure to check the entrance before going into the area with the elevators since floors 4-28 were on the far left and floors 29-up were straight ahead. The pool area is the same. You just show your room key at the entrance to see the pool area. You can rent a cabana or daybed if you want to sit around the pool.

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We were able to check in a few hours early. Score! I had a pleasant and relaxing time here."
lXpW71tpE9Mgb5L_fnnqVg,3,"Went in about 30 minutes before closing and did not have to wait. Receptionist, nurse (MA?) and phlebotomist were all super nice and office was very clean. Physicians assistant made me very uncomfortable though, 3 stars and will not be returning because of him."

J0Miu_C9uTRf1N0b3eQyXA,5,"Best Pho I have had in a while! I had the shrimp rice rolls and the spicy seafood vermicelli soup.

The soup is absolutely delicious and the portions are reasonable for the price. The ingredients are fresh and simple, yet extremely flavourful. If you can really handle spicy food, you will find that their spicy soups are not really spicy and might want to add a little chili oil/ hot sauce. 

The shrimp rice roll was fresh and delicious as well. There was good size  shrimps in there, which is always a plus. Peanut sauce is great too. 

Service was quick and friendly, we were for seated right away."
PD-rklXkpETM51GmfgFGHQ,5,Tony and his crew is amazing! His prices are very decent and he isn't trying to rip people off at all. His workers are respectful and they clean up well after themselves. The services provided to us was to demo out the original pool and we are putting new tile and redoing the pebble tec. Today the crew is here to add the new pebble tec and once it's done I will show you the finished product. You can surely depend on Tony replying back with a phone call or text for sure he won't keep you waiting. He takes care of his customers no matter how many jobs he's got going on at the same time.

-aKOR5obfB155KICvuPNDQ,5,"I cannot express enough how truly happy we were to have chosen Ben to do our wedding Fri 2/19/16.  From the very start Ben was very accommodating and seemed all about providing the best customer service and customizing everything for our event ! Well , as the night went ... BEN STILL EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS WE HAD !! 
He made me feel at ease with how the night was going to go ; he worked well with the coordinator ; and when there was chaos , confusion or the party was lacking .... Ben stepped up to help organize the wedding party and even coming  out and dancing ( which we loved seeing ) 
We gave Him a list of music choices and asked him to go off that vibe .... HE NAILED IT !! Every song that came on was a hit. He also was very accommodating to our guests requests. The photo booth rocked and it was nice to get the link to view all the photo booth shots ! If I am in need of DJ ; I'll call Ben again of course . Couldn't be happier !!"

The lounge chairs in the water is an amazing feature and great to keep cool. Great music and very spacious. The indoor dance floor is crazy energetic.
y63uysNhexJGLTVHuKHx_A,5,Love love love this salon. I've been going to a busy place in Scottsdale every 2 weeks and they NEVER remember me. These guys talked to my mom and I the entire time and actually had a conversation with us. Our nails look fantastic and we didn't feel rushed to get out the door when most salons feel like they are pushing you out of the chair. They are on my way home from work so I will be a regular on Friday afternoons from now on. Thank you for treating me and my mom so great!

uCQG8B2au3QvJC9q0KUqcg,3,"Heading into Concord on Church Street, Troutman's is on the left. This is their main location and you'll notice the cook house in the rear of the parking lot. They still cook their BBQ on site, I think they still use wood but not positive about that . Troutman's is an old family run business and has been serving BBQ for many years. The provided a heaping sandwich which was very tasty. The slaw was good and my bun was toasted. I had two sandwiches and tea for $8.51. The service was good and the food was good too. The building could use some updating but it's a good place to stop in and taste BBQ the way it should be served.

BBQ education; there are two NC styles of BBQ: 

Eastern mostly whole hogs slow cooked over wood and sometimes gas and served with Brunswick stew (beef and chicken with vegetables), slaw (either yellow or red), corn bread (either hush puppies or corn bread sticks), white small potatoes or fries. The sauce is usually vinegar based with some added spices especially red peppers. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled. 

The other mostly in western NC is usually pork shoulders either slow cooked over wood or gas. Gas is becoming a popular fuel to conserve wood and the air quality. The wood adds some great flavor and many people don't want it any other way. Pork shoulders are smaller cuts of meat and cook in less time. The cooked meat usually is served with a mayonnaise based slaw, fries or on a sandwich. If you order a basket or tray you usually just get BBQ and hush puppies. If you order a plate you get fries and probably a side of slaw. The sides can certainly vary... so ask. The sauce is usually thick and red, based with ketchup some added spices especially red peppers and vinegar. You can usually find Texas Pete served also. The BBQ can be sliced, pulled or chopped... and some of the skin and fat is usually left in for flavor. Most people prefer pulled which is larger pieces, if you don't specify then you will usually get pulled.
 
Many area restaurants now offer BBQ Chicken and beef brisket (mostly a Texas dish) along with pork spare ribs and beef ribs too. These items are not typically found with true NC family BBQ establishments... mostly the larger ones trying the satisfy more people with their offerings. 

Since Concord and Charlotte are in the middle of the state... you will find both types here."
uoKFuHbx1b8cBiz6-UewOg,5,"We came here to shop, eat, and catch a show.  We loved the layout of their shopping area and the show we caught was called the Variety Show. Damn good if you ask me! My review is based on everything we exp outside of staying at the hotel itself. Would love to stay here sometime to see how the rest of the casino is like."
gvJhBKscvw8wmeFE2IN9vQ,4,"Went for dinner one time at this downtown location and was surprised... it's day and night when comparing the two Cafe Gentiles! Great food on both ends however.

For dinner at the downtown location I ordered the bruschetta to start things off and split the Sunday Lunch for Two which consisted of meatballs, sausages, and beef ribs laying on top of a bed of pasta with tomato sauce and cheese. Bruschetta was good, and that sausage was great! Of course to wash it all down I took the classic Gentile iced tea.

Again, such a difference in both locations or at least lunch and dinner wise but great food throughout. If you're looking for a more casual visit, go for breakfast or lunch."
J8IDGvno7QFrqguv4qANOQ,5,Loved staying at this hotel.  The beds are so comfortable.  The front staff is very friendly.  Would definitely stay here again if visiting Phoenix.
ocIaFwXtdV6n48s4S7kkbQ,2,"I visited Red Ginger with my family over the wknd, and unfortunately the experience was less than satisfactory. My salad had some sort of grainy substance in it. The rest if the food was equally as disappointing. I should have got the hint when the hotel concierge thought the place had closed down when we asked about it. The one positive experience we had was our server; he was very accommodating, and pleasant- thank you for making this experience tolerable."
sImUJuId90s-jzfgpCOaOA,1,This store was disgusting when I was in ages but I gave them another shot this past week.  I ordered and pulled up to the window. While sitting there with the drive thru window wide open I see a guy come out if the kitchen with a little cigarette in his mouth talking about how he dropped his phone in the fryer.  I'm pretty much done with this location entirety and this company all together. I've never been in a Popeyes and thought to myself they really take care of their locations. They seem to hire crew and managers who other restaurants deem undesirable.
mjEaokALgtrOIthcJ9oqDg,3,"Came here tonight for some burgers and milkshakes an we weren't disapponted.  I was in the mood for a salad and soup but the soup wasn't that appetizing to me.  I did add a salad to my burger and I think it was a bad choice.  The Greek salad was very over dressed and was made with iceberg lettuce instead of romaine.  Can't really complained it's a diner.  You can count on this diner for all day breakfast, burgers, fries, and milkshakes!"
4GVK03OE-2QlTuDU2_kMUw,5,"I recently just visited my dad in Phoenix and wanted to get my boyfriend something from Margaritaville but didn't want to eat there so he said The Yard House was a great place to eat.  OMG...yep he was right!!!

We got hummus to start with.  First of all....this was the BEST hummus I have ever had.  It was so good.  I want some right now and I would have to buy a plane ticket and fly for four hours just to get it.  BIG BUMMER!!!  For my lunch I got the greek salad and it was amazing.  It was very light and refreshing.  Just what I was wanting.  

Not only was the food great but my drink was so good!  I got the Rose Garden which was Hoegaarden White and Lindeman's Framboise.  I'm going to have to find something close to this here because I have to drink this during the summer.  

I got a taste of the Ahi tuna sandwich and it was delicious too.  I'm pretty sure that you won't be disappointed with anything here.  I know I'm in love and have a place I have to go to when I'm in Phoenix!"
1JYyyfKiLduzzzwD73Ppsw,5,"This is the only place you can find ""real"" local food.  Try out their ""ono"" pork hash and long johns.  Thank you Joe and Violet for the Ono local style food.  Much aloha to you and your ohana."
p-R48oMv_wSvRhHzQp2MTQ,1,This is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to. The last two times I have been here there has been 2 employees and about 5 people in line and 10 waiting for drinks. It's really sad to have such a bad experience multiple times.
zBmWQInP9-z1jLqQdrLwDg,4,"After an afternoon at the pool I really wanted a nice dinner at a place with ambiance. I came to Bandera, a nice booth and looked at the menu. Almost everything looked delicious. I did order the Prime rib which was beyond expectation. Salty crispy outside and a juicy (medium) inside. The mashed potatoes were so flavorful. I loved the main dish and ended up with Oreo Sandwiches for desert.  My dinner was lovely."

M6HB1PiRY0BtSm6p5khpzA,4,"T bones!
Another Resturant that I've been visiting for about 10 years. I'm going keep this short and sweet.

Let's start with the good:
Great place for eating ANYTIME of the day as it's 24/7.
The cashier there is very friendly and funny.
Food quality is good and the portion is decent.
T-Bones has always been good with consistency.
Steaks are great. I cannot speak about the burgers because I always get a steak there.

Now, onto the bad.
Not so much bad but here goes:

only had one bad experience with steak there. I ordered a rare steak and I couldn't eat it. I don't know if it's the type of steak but it was gross. So I only eat medium rare there..other places like keg or red lobster I'll take a rare steak. 

Price increase of the steak special from 11.99 to 16 or 17.99! Really??? One special will not fill me up so I don't go there as much as I use to because of the price increase.

T bones is a good place to chill and have a good steak and fries or mashed potato. 

3/5 due to the price increase

Here is a pic of the 32 oz combo and 16 oz combo

Thanks 
Kimon"
V3CJBvNV9sjEvmeGX5Znig,1,Was at Westgate always go to Whiskey Rose. Ordered hamburger which was great. But menu says served with one side. Then why was I charged for a side. Waitress says they always charge for a side. Then why have the menu that says served with one side. YOU LOST A CUSTOMER.
9JGeaga55u8cCe7FHDj7gA,2,"I chose to get a pedicure at this new place as it is close to my work and they had online booking. It also states on their website that they offer beer, champagne, wine, water and coffee while you get your nails done. The website also states they do hot stone massage. When I got to the salon, I was assigned to Freda and she was nice but didn't say anything throughout the pedicure. I was never offered any drinks, instead I had to ask for a water. She was working very quickly and I think she took a total of 20 minutes on my pedi. There was also no hot stones used.
The icing on the cake was that there is a 75 cent fee charged when you make your appt online which requires your credit card information and it shows you owe the remaining amount at the salon. When I was paying, they charged me the full amount- I mentioned the website fee and the lady said she didn't know anything about it and that fee doesn't go to the salon. I mentioned they should fix that then as it is misleading. She blamed the owners and said ""I hear you"" but she didn't fix the transaction. 
Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed with my entire service"
PWQ3JyQ-lQZYtlY_PELAhw,3,"I waited an hour for my delivery and I'm so excited to sit down to finally eat and...it's not what I ordered. I called and the girl that answered the phone gave it to the guy who took my order and decided he wanted to let me know it's what I ordered. Actually, it's not what I ordered otherwise I wouldn't have called.  Needless to say they said they would deliver what I ordered. Luckily I love their pizza and have eaten there many times and it's always amazing. Hopefully this was a one time issue and aside from trying to argue with me they're making it right. Four stars 

... It's now been two hours since I ordered the pizza and we're pretty starving. I'm starting to wonder if they're coming. It was a four stars but now I need to drop it to a three

...seriously, it's so late now and I don't think they're coming. I ended up needing to have a piece of the wrong pizza because I'm starving and now I feel obligated to stay awake just in case....oh never mind they're here. Is it bad that I'm worried they spit in it? They wouldn't do that right?"
hp6aQdJsyRthbgjI3F2_mQ,4,"Cool dive bar hidden off the beaten path of the art district downtown. I love it because of the casual atmosphere the most. Intimate seating or group seating is available. And on the weekend's there is live music!

Signature drinks are available, but there is a full bar so really anything you want the bartenders can make it. Scooby snacks are delicious here. 

The location has been around for a long time so of course there are parts that seem run down. It's just a shame there isn't a little more upkeep."
trE7Y_KBD2S3GOUpn5OGtA,1,"Had the pleasure of dealing with a rude young lady behind the counter today. I reserved a 26' truck to be picked up at this location. After I arrived there, I was informed that my reservation had been moved to a location on North Rancho regardless of what my reservation said that I printed from the U-Haul website! So I drive to the second location only to be told that I need to go to a third location. I go to the other location and am informed by a much friendlier person that there are no 26' trucks in town period. I am then sent back to the second location to pick up a 20' truck and when I get there, I am informed that there are no 20' trucks available. I tried calling the Oso Blanca location to find out if they have any 20' trucks available and am put on hold by the same rude young lady I had already dealt with. After being on hold for five minutes, I hung up and called back two or three more times to speak with management and now they won't even answer my phone call. They send me straight to hold. Horrible customer service, horrible empathy for their customer, horrible communication between locations. If I were the owner/manager here, I would work really hard to make sure this never happens again to any customers. This place is a great example of the direction that customer service has gone in Las Vegas. I will never do business with them again and will tell all my neighbors to go elsewhere. Could have saved me a whole lot of trouble by doing a little research and making phone calls. Would leave a zero star if I could, they don't deserve one."
KBfKkDsFm0hi_7pudkfNmg,5,"Great sushi and roll! Free miso soup and salad.
We had several rolls and they were all really good.
Fish tasted very fresh.
Service was very friendly and good.
We came on a Friday evening and it was very busy.
But sushi came out very fast.
I highly recommend."
ZjjQF1xXMQd5erjlIJtEVg,5,"The service is great and the food is even better. I've been here about 5 times now. Each time I've visited, I've had something different and it was just as good as the first time. 

Their fish in the spicy black bean sauce? Awesome. Their mongolian beef? Delicious. Their fish in spicy chili oil? Yummy. Kung pao chicken? Soooo good! And if that isn't enough for you, their rolls are yummy and CHEAP! 

And the ladies I've seen each time I've been in there are so sweet! They already remember my husband and I, and just have such a genuine warmth about them. Aside from the food being great, I want the restaurant to succeed because I love the people who work there.

Go to Sun Asian! You'll be so happy you did!"
zDZ8kR4WqieB1DygBuazvA,3,"Very mixed experience with Big Grove. The first few times I've gone was excellent-- food was served on time and still hot, good service.

Other times have not been so good. After I boasted about the establishment, my friends and I had to wait 30 minutes despite having made a reservation on Friday night. Our food was served lukewarm, certain things on the menu weren't served, and our waiter was hardly seen. 

I'd give it a 2 star if it wasn't for their use of local produce, whimsical daily popcorn flavors, and appealing decor. Much like my loyalty to Adam Sandler, I just keep expecting greatness and have great hopes for their future work! A very much romanticized version of Big Grove."
OU_03BqJNizGVcIrSCobww,5,"Hubs has a complicated prescription and really hasn't been able to see well in a few years after seeing several eye doctors in multiple states (we've moved a lot!). Dr. Baht did the most thorough exam I've witnessed and has all the high tech equipment at his disposal. We ordered glasses at the initial appointment and Dr. said he would do some research on the appropriate contacts and call us back to try some. We went back to pick up the glasses (they're Tag Heuer-made in France-very nice) the next week and tried the contacts on. Dr. Baht hit the nail on the head right outta the gate. The glasses are perfect and the contacts, although the manufacturer doesn't make as many sizes as they could, are working very well for both distance and close up vision. Very impressive - we expected the need to return to try multiple types so were pleasantly surprised. The office is modern and comfortable. Great selection of eye glasses and sunglasses. Staff is friendly and efficient. We are happy to have an eye Dr. and a team who are proficient and personable close to home. Don't hesitate to go to this eye doctor! Top notch."
HCd1yx8kmPLK4lYG89s-jw,5,"I highly recommend J. Beauté Artistry!! Jeny is absolutely amazing and she never disappoints! I've been going to Jeny for a couple of years now. I currently live in Dallas and when Jeny is taking appointments in Houston, I will drive to Houston (4hr drive) just to get my touch-up from her. 

She is very patient, honest, and communicates well. 
When you contact her for a consolation to set an appointment, show her photos of the color you're trying to achieve along with a photo of your current hair. Everyone's hair is different, so she will work with you to give you fresh, slaying hair. The process of getting balayage ombré hair could take a couple of sessions depending on the color you're trying to achieve. In the end, it's worth the time and money!!"
tLJPxEq0c2kmN3J3GMkPbw,1,"I'm not changing my opinion, but merely saying that it's not the staff on property at fault. It's these people who aren't here and are impossible to get a hold of people who couldn't care less. The staff here is friendly, but have no authority. I'm only updating this because I don't want the wrong perception taken. I still feel that the parent company who control these situations are horrible! I'm aware now that it's part of living in an apartment. Sad but True."
ILzdgklzsA8auWeedzP4lw,4,"The ribs were mediocre for the price but to be fair they were sold out of everything else which says a lot for what they didn't have. What they did have was the ribs which again, were OK... 

I will go back to try the brisket since it seems to be a hit with yelpers. 

I'll say that we also had their Mac n Cheese which was pretty awesome! I rarely order Mac n Cheese (my wife ordered it) but I was not disappointed in any way about it. 

I will update when I get back because it was worth trying again. If there's any brisket left by the time I get there...

Good for a switch from the rib chains."

KCa2_c6CykHxAqXHTf-PRA,5,"Dr. Mahajan himself is an extraordinarily doctor. He tells his patients if you experience symptoms to go to the hospital and contact his office. I followed his directions and when I tried to follow up with him, his scheduler could care less and I was told I couldn't be seen for SIX months! So six months after a trip to the ER for stroke symptoms for follow up is unreal."
LROs3-k8n9zPQmI8amTR1A,1,Edgepark medical supplies company is my absolute worst nightmare! Every month I have to call in an order for my infant son's formula. Every month I have to fight with them in order to get the order shipped to me. The first thing I'm told is they denied the order because they don't have the medical necessity on file yet after fighting with them they review the file and find out. Then the order gets stopped in billing due to the same missing documentation. I'm always informed that they will update the file and they don't follow through. Numerous times I've called my insurance company to talk to edgepark with me on the line and supposedly is fixed. On the 1st I call in and low and behold they need the medical necessity. I seem to get the run around. They continually put my order on a hold I'm constantly having to tell them I'm on his last can and by the time I recieve the shipment my 6 month old infant out down to his last few bottles. Why?  How can a company be so incompetent that they cannot update the information on file that they already have in the system?  Why do I have to fight with them every single month?  This past month I called on the 27th to place the order. Customer service supposedly sends the order 4 days pass no package I called back they said I never placed an order. I get switched from one person to another they finally fess up that the order was rotated through 4 customer service reps and then canceled. Why wasn't I informed?  No phone call no email nothing to inform me of the issue. I call on the 1st it's another 2 hour phone call of they need this info they need that it's being held up my coding now it's being held up by billing. Finally the issue is resolved they are sending out formula I recieve an email and surprise I'm only getting half my order. Why?  Today is another merry go round I've talked to probably 10+ reps nobody has an answer and the issue still isn't resolved. Save yourself the stress and go with a different company. Edgepark doesn't care about their customers who depend on them to provide services that they bill insurance for. They show no compassion and no initiative to resolve issues as they arise. This company will do nothing more than frustrate you with every conversation. They are incompetent when it comes to doing their part and point the finger at your insurance company and you as the customer.
yX_oSpV4f7SNmojjMm0WJA,5,"The staff and Dr  Gabriel were very friendly and more importantly efficient, professional and highly skilled. As a first-time patient I was impressed by how will run their office seems to be. They do digital x-rays here which I am told are safer than traditional x-rays, though I'm not an expert. The hygienist Brenda was highly skilled. Misha who does teeth whitening seems to know her stuff and I star photos of impressive results. And Dr. Gabriel impressed me and I will continue to see her. Don't be confused by the name Posh as I first was, as this is a very professional establishment."
_V0z4nUbivQk3MQTbuyxYQ,4,We didn't stay here but we came to visit specifically for the coaster. It was absolutely amazing. The price is about $14 a person but they do sell all day passes for about $25. Definitely a must do.
xheigdh0WPoshzxwEgbJKA,1,"Hideous sums it up. Won't go into detail, too much negative. There are, a couple ok things about staying here, but not really worth a mention. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here. Plenty of other hotels on the strip to stay in."
1Zv98cglrm0XrV_J2HZv3g,5,"Ridiculous. In a good way. Food was great as was the service. Your water isn't just water, the standard is with slices of cucumber, so wonderful! The omelets are so great and come with herb potatoes and rosemary creme fraiche. Also had the pumpkin spice pancakes on the side, so great. We were visiting for a wedding and one of the many friendly locals suggested it. A walk from our hotel in Old Town, it was a wonderful brunch and would for sure return if ever in the area again."
PVDrzLgXqkHdsaNayxPjng,5,"Took my Wife  there for her Birthday,  our Waiter (Thomas) was so very nice and courteous, from the first moment he arrived at our booth up until the time we were walking toward the door his service was excellent. He even gave us a little tip on how to best order your Filet Mignon,  my wife took his advice when she ordered and after finishing her dinner said she totally agreed with him, noting that she will order it that way from now on. The appetizer we shared was delicious ( chicken on flatbread) and the Salmon I had was plentiful and delicious as well with an assortment of grilled veggies. We will definitely dine there again in the future, just hope all their employees are as nice and as courteous as Thomas."
ThyHPHWobUZPR89XspEFpQ,3,"been there a few times,  was not bad the first time I went.  only complaint I had was  their was more side dish than main course.  So I felt like I was getting a sample of the main dish (curry chicken, goat, etc) while paying full price.  

went again and didn't even finish my meal.  I guess they were having an off day with the flavor. So I'll be looking for another restaurant soon."
jQUlGktidajN0kpNykk1nA,3,"Well, if you want VOLUME, this is the place for you.  Generous portions & very fair pricing. Lunch specials for about $5.65 and dinner specials for about $8 and up.  The dinner combo includes soup, egg roll, two fried shrimp, veggie fried rice and the entree of your choice.  I prefer less food but have tastier food.  Too much of bad is just bad, but a little bit of good is excellent.  
Here's why my star allocation is the way it is:
1.  Egg drop soup which comes with the Dinner combination had very little taste.  It is about 4 ounces but considering it is free, some consumers would appreciate it.  I would rather have no soup than tasteless soup.
2.  The free fried shrimp which come with the dinner combo were 70% crust.  Shrimp not cleaned. Found a long string of poop when I opened it.  A bit oily too.  See photos.  
3.  My House chow mein which came with Fried rice did not have much flavor. A few drops of sesame oil would have done the trick.  I added soy sauce to make it taste better.  If you see the photo, it looks delightful but it is a disappointment to the taste.
4.  Hubby LOVED his Orange chicken.  It was thinly sliced chicken and lightly crusted.  They should have followed suit on the shrimp and they would have been perfect.  Had brown rice with it for 50 cents extra.  
5.  Egg roll was pretty good.  Lots of veggies and not too greasy until you get to the end of the egg roll but that is to be expected.
Cordial service, clean place, very fair pricing.  
If you want a lot of food for a cheap price, this is the place for you."
k2tFQR1HiQ8wM6U5tmk8HA,5,"I've gone to Beautif-Eye about 10 times for a full face thread. I have to say it does make a difference who you get. In my opinion, Diana is by far the best and you can tell she is a perfectionist, not just getting people in and out, but really putting 100% into making sure it's done right."
_VYi2yrJxKENejY7M_n4ug,5,"Having previously been customers of Smelly Dog, I was apprehensive about patronizing their competition. But, things change. And last night when I was making a last minute run for a travel water dish, WNW filled the void perfectly (even though it was 7:58 p.m. and they close at 8 p.m., the staff was super friendly--I couldn't say I'd have the same enthusiasm if I was in that situation). Today cemented my faith in WNW: the ice cream social was crazy awesome. 

As some may know, we had an addition to our family recently. Max is a 3 year old cocker spaniel who was approaching being placed in a shelter [one of my coworker's customers alerted her to his family's predicament and she came to me to intervene. Although Robert was scheduled to leave town for a week, we decided to give Max a chance that Friday night and he's blended perfectly into our home. Brady now has a new brother and I'm happy to report that they have grown rather attached.] Needless to say, we're still on the learning curve when it comes to Max's temperament, which was rather challenged in the presence of so many dogs Saturday. But, true to form, the staff remained encouraging (unlike some of the queenie bitches who weren't on leashes) and gave us hope that Max, like Brady, will be able to mellow out. 

Both of our kids had lovely, customized baths (Brady went for sleek and shiny while Max opted for citrus wash) which we were able to administer at our leisure. A bucket of washing goodies was brought out--brushes, shampoo, cream rinse, leave-in conditioner, towels and a wash cloth. The attendants were there to answer any questions along the way. The drying stations are separate from the washing basins, which was different from SD, but makes sense since now. 

While I agree some of the prices are on the high end, I'd much rather invest my money with a smaller business then dump my paycheck into Wal-Mart. If you're looking for Wal-Mart prices, you should expect Wal-Mart customer service. WNW is leaps and bounds above and beyond its competitors."
pd63euMoOZmF6LfEOu6liQ,4,"Classy and beautiful. Had a fantastic experience the first 2 times, the third wasn't great because they sat us in the crappier portion in the back, which lacks the amazing speakeasy atmosphere. Eventually we were moved to better seats and had a great night."

5Rfc343m4Byee43SGqNZzw,4,"I have received many referrals to pink polish. Thinking it would be this posh, way to expensive for what you get sort of place I was hesitant to ""waste my money."" I was pleasantly surprised that the pricing was comparable to some of the other places I had been disappointed by but here you get what you pay for and more. I went to Pink Polish a little over a week ago and waited to review intentionally to see how fast my nails would peel.... Gels on my hand last at the most one week. As of today Im two days shy of two weeks and going strong. Only two of my nails have started to peel. My only small complaints are the small language barrier with some of the technicians (but this was a far cry from some place I've been) and the rush i felt at the very beginning. I only had a moment to look through their vast selection of colors before getting brought back. My technician did go and get some choices for me when I was unhappy with my first choice though which was nice. The venue is comfortable and relaxing. I definitely will be going back to this salon. I had a chance to speak with the man in charge and he was very friendly  and talkative and my experience ended on a wonderful note! Thank you pink polish!"
rbOU0Pi2s4ihPABWFXerUQ,5,"The sectional I *really* wanted cost over $3,000 and the furniture store couldn't deliver it for 8 weeks. I needed it in 4. So I found the exact same sectional, that was used, but still in great shape. The cushions, however, were just sad and beat up and ugly. I spent too many hours online researching about upholstery and now I know A LOT about fabrics and foam. haha. I'd never upholstered anything in my life. At first I was going to buy new fabric cushions online, but that would still take 3-4 weeks and I was running out of time. Plus I didn't trust fabric I couldn't touch/see in person, nor was I comfortable with my measuring skillz. The sectional is huge and from my research I knew it'd be pricey. I went on yelp. I found one place, but the fabric was just OK, not what I wanted, and the guy was kinda rude. Another place I went to, the price was eye-popping. o.O I was ready to give up.

I found Oscar's Upholstery on here, which had fewer reviews than the rest, but were all 5 star. I was frustrated with the whole process by then, but wanted to get out of the office. Since his locale is close to my work I went up to see what he could offer.
 
First off, he greeted me with a smile and shook my hand even as I waltzed in telling him what I needed without taking a breath. Immediately, to my shock, he had the exact fabric I was looking for. Then I held my breath for the price. My day got better! It was more than reasonable and way more my price range!!! He had it done in a week (all 8 of the back cushions and the HUGE 4 seat cushions). He also had me bring in my old cushions so he could stuff them for me. :D I can't express how relieved I am to have found Oscar. He did amazing work so fast and I'm ecstatic with the results!! I now have a go-to upholstery guy and will tell all my friends about him. He's personable, professional, and a man of his craft! Truly a 5 star find. See my before & after pics. It looks exactly like the sectional I wanted from the store, at a fraction of the price. SO HAPPY!"
SbBNR2HtLL1QissZTqTd8g,5,"This place is a great lunch spot. The atmosphere is great, especially knowing it really was an authentic old church.  The food is great starting with the appetizer trio (queso, guacamole,and bean dip...), then try the traditional or new wave tacos, but I like the grilled romain with shrimp and the slightly spicy Caesar dressing. Drinks are large and they refill often. This is one of my favorite lunch places."

d4UXQMyx8NkA8HQsxGIgtA,4,"This place is a few minutes from our house so my boyfriend and I tend to come a lot. It has a very ""local"" feel to it which I like. Their ""Cave Creek"" salad is delicious and literally EVERY dish is MASSIVE. Do not come here unless you're starving or else you will bring half of your order home with you. 

They're one of the only places that we have found that sell ""two harded ale"" ... A Michigan beer which is my bfs fav. As long as we live near by we will come and come again."

I could only eat half my meal( decent portions) so I have leftovers for tomorrow! I will be back!"

ABqHpYrtbCucxTgoGaq7NA,4,"Excellent food and pretty good service.

Been going there for over a year now, and I must say, I've yet to try anything there that I didn't like.

My only minor gripe about them is when you order something that includes a salad and you agree to have what they refer to as ""everything"" on the salad, they only put a few things on. I feel it a bit much to specify each topping when I literally do want everything they have on my salad :-/

Regardless, I'd definitely recommend 'em for lunch, never tried 'em for breakfast. Just beware of their menu, as they don't quite have everything on it, so updating it would be nice too :-)"
bXmzn5RAi-XfR0ZnZdSp4Q,3,"A couple of friends and I were in town to catch some Spring Training Games.  A friend who used to live in AZ highly recommended Joe's to us.  After getting confused in the Loop a few times, we finally made it.

The Belgian Waffle and BBQ Pork Ribs was the dish of choice.  Waffles and Ribs for Breakfast?  We were in heaven!  I've told others of this combo and even showed them our photos.  They were disgusted and said that was the most unhealthy breakfast they'd ever heard of.  How can 4 smoked baby back ribs be worse for you than say 4 link sausages or 4 slices of bacon, both of which are fried?  Although the meat didn't fall off the bone, the ribs were tender.  I wasn't fond of the sauce, it was a little too tangy for my taste. (see photo)

The fresh apple mini fritters were also a hit.  They're fried fresh to order, served hot, and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  (see photo)

We also had the chicken and mushroom scramble.  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, caramelized onion, fontina + cream cheese.  It was good, but definately not my favorite of the three, and I probably wouldn't order it again.

This is a must eat spot if you're in the Phoenix area, and worth the drive."

yjNQxGJMXa-gKuMvPsT_yA,3,"While it was busy and the food was okay, I'm giving it 3 stars because of the quality of the service. I had called in advance to see if I could reserve a table (knowing it would be busy on a Friday but was told that they don't reserve for tables of 5 people and should just drop in. It's not a big deal but the girl on the phone wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Despite having bad service on the phone, we came anyway to try out luck and waited for over 45 minutes. When we were finally seated, the servers rushed us to order the food. We barely had time to crack open the menu before we were asked to order. 

The quality of the food was fairly good. The sauces came out quickly except for soy sauce. We had asked them to get us soy sauce 4 times but they always forgot to bring it. Finally, we had to just order soy sauce with no menu items to make sure we could get that sauce. 

At the end of the meal, we got ice cream! Each person at the table is able to have 1 soft serve each. :) The ice cream at the end was definitely the highlight of my meal. If you're looking for a hot pot place, this one is good for groups for more than 5 since you can reserve and have a table readily available. Be prepared for the servers to be lacking in presence BUT! If you just want simple hot pot, Morals Village is exactly that -- hot pot without the extra frills."
-54MSnTbpOFTXD1X2UJeCg,1,"Worked for this company for a year. Awful upper management, awful lower management (coming from a former shift manager). Disgustingly dirty in the back and far too overpriced for somewhere that has similar quality to McDonalds. A few things that happened while I worked there:
We raised prices and went down in quality of product twice over the course of the year I work there. 
We switched to 20 ounce cups instead of 22 and I was instructed by management to not tell customers and to lie if asked about it.
Slimy white mold covering the bottom of the make table (where they keep veggies, toppings and backup cheese) and my GM Kari Jacobson told me flat out she didn't care and that it wasn't her problem. She has since been fired. 
If you walk in there now, they advertise specials like ""date nights"" and ""kids eat free days."" They're trying their damndest to stay afloat. I quit 10 months ago and it was the best decision of my life. 
The only thing worth buying here is a shake. Those are delicious and made with real ice cream. If you value your health and wallet, I wouldn't even recommend looking at anything else."

The Australian Bee Gees show is a celebration of one of disco's most legendary names, bringing the music that shaped the cultural landscape of the 1970's to the Excalibur Hotel & Casino.  I am nothing if not a Bee Gees fan (my wedding processional was ""More Than a Woman"" and my recessional was ""How Deep Is Your Love""), so the opportunity to see their pre-eminent tribute group was one that I relished.

The Australian Bee Gees did not disappoint, suspending the belief of the audience for 75 minutes with Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb.  They opened with favorites ""You Should Be Dancing"" and ""Jive Talkin'"".  In their addresses to the audience, they capture the essence of the Brothers Gibb, quirks, flowing locks, and all.

ABG was inclusive in their tribute, covering everything from the soulful, early hits like ""Massachusetts,"" ""I've Got to Get a Message to You,"" and ""I Started a Joke,"" to their Saturday Night Fever and disco hits like ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""Tragedy,"" and ""If I Can't Have You (I Don't Want Nobody, Baby).""  They even performed the title track to Grease, which, though performed by Frankie Valli for the film and soundtrack, was written by Barry Gibb, a fact often overlooked by even the most devoted of Bee Gees fans.

Anyone who loves the Bee Gees will undoubtedly be pleased by both the song selections and the interactive nature of the show.  ABG not only performed everyone's favorites, devoting time to more than just their number one hits, they also gave the audience the opportunity to show off their disco moves at ""Mo's,"" an area of the theatre designated as Maurice's ""nightclub,"" where the audience could become more than passive spectators and dance to the songs that were meant to be danced to, not just listened to.

The Australian Bee Gees are the closest thing that many of their younger fans will ever get to seeing the Bee Gees perform together and the closest thing that their older fans will have to reliving their favorite concert memories.  Michael Clift, Wayne Hosking, and Dave Scott amply live up to the great responsibility that this fact has placed on them, offering a solid performance that would make Barry, Robin, and Maurice proud."

oCm0xeiUQS6dE8_HV76xDA,4,"I'm a self-proclaimed pizza snob and Jesse's Supreme Pizza was excellent. Nice mix of pepperoni, spicy sausage and yummy vegetables. I only wish I'd ordered the large. The best thing by far though was the garlic knots. You get a dozen for less than $5. They are so delicious I ate at least three right away. Will be a regular customer for sure. Food was delivered quickly which was a nice bonus."
ziVQDi-1Yx5CLFAkNJSBwg,5,Great atmosphere! The servers and bartenders were fast and friendly. GM was quite hands on with the patrons. Drinks are yummy and pack a punch.
npybKs1t5viCV5zFP0CJQA,5,"Walked by here as a spectator and it looks fabulous for a modern indoor/outdoor/garden/lounge type of an event.  

Great lawn space. The only thing missing is shielded privacy in the outdoor lounge area."
WqmiaedSkdhyZcYS9KMFpg,4,"This library resides in a 26-room, 20,000 square foot mansion built in the 1920's. Its style is a mix of English Tudor and French Normandy. The only thing missing seems to be a moat and drawbridge. 

Needless to say, this residence serves as a very unique and charming atmosphere for a library. Peace and tranquility are descriptive words that come to mind in describing the mood set here. 

This branch is part of the Cuyahoga County Public Library Greater Access system. It's a great place to spend reading or to browse the scenic property. My only issue with it is that this location doesn't seem as up-to-date with all the latest releases as other nearby libraries, including the Mayfield location."
LsIdLAcR00MeSkR8o_lydw,4,"This is an update to my previous review on 9/16/2013.  I've now bumped up the rating from a 1 to a 4 for my overall experience.  Lauren L., Customer Advocate Manager, was great.  She promptly followed up with me to discuss my issues I was experiencing.  She was very friendly and genuinely sounded like she was concerned.  Also, my Loan Officer, Erik E, reached out to me to make sure everything was processed timely and followed through to closing.  Everything finally closed a few days late but none the less, closed and finalized.

I originally selected  RoundPoint based on feeling the most comfortable with my Loan Officer after a few initials contacts through phone and email.  They weren't the lowest rates but one of the lowest plus very responsive.  One thing I would say is be aware of and double check all the numbers.  After I decided to go with RoundPoint, they changed the initial offer by charging more fees.  Again, I choose to go with them because I was most comfortable with them but this definitely made be pay closer attention to the rest of the paperwork.  There were a few things here and there (could have been computer or human error) that I caught but RoundPoint corrected those along the way.  I guess this can happen with any bank, so I would recommend to check everything!

I was on the fence about the updated rating but overall gave the 4 based on RoundPoint resolving my issues and promptly taking action.  I feel the added stress and aggravation would have been nice to avoid in the first place but what's important is it was addressed and everything is done now."
5QG_L0KoEepoicmpGo6h_Q,5,"One of the most incredible space in downtown Phoenix. 

Always a delightful experience. 

This last Art Detour (2008), on the second floor I saw two ghosts.  So that was pretty awesome.  My boyfriend opened the door and then closed it and I said let's go in there.  He said there was nothing in there.  I said I saw two people walking.  I really did.  He opened the door and in the back of the room, I saw a light and two people walking.  We opened the door again, and it was pitch black and empty.  Totally freaky!"

Shepherds pie and fish and chip.  Thank you Travis for fantastic service!"
IJNTykNpHPOowLDAPY023A,5,Nice restaurant with a lot of great vegetarian and vegan options. The food is healthy and they try to accommodate any special requests you may have. The prices are very reasonable as well.
mSIvIFmYrhvuciOgAMrd-w,4,"Just came home from dinner at Dominic's. Got a few recommendations to try it so tonight we did. I am very pleasantly surprised. everything was fresh, tasty, high quality and service was perfect for a family owned Italian restaurant. Décor is semi authentic kitschy old Italian. Food was good/ very good. Definitely will be back."
WQedF3i69ksXCL0Tr5LcQw,5,"My all time favorite Starbucks location in Phoenix. I literally came here for 3-4 months straight to study for an exam. I practically lived here! The staff is always so sweet and welcoming (shoutout to Avery and Kyle!) and this location is always spotless. Moreover, this place is especially wonderful because it's got a spectacular view. I always love watching the sunset here!

Parking has never personally been an issue for me, but the immediate surrounding parking lot is pretty small. However, there is a ton of parking for all of the other buildings nearby -- which, yes, might be a little dreadful in the Phoenix heat, but honestly, it's totally worth it.

If I'm not at home, the gym or Sprouts, 9 times out of 10, I'm most likely here."
L71IYgFkL6-mt8H4t_k2kg,4,"It may not be a 5 star hotel for some, but this location gets 5 stars from me! 

Pros:
Location 
Price
Cleanliness 
Hospitality 
Room amenities 
Shower! 
Good for families 
Print boarding passes 
WiFi works!! 

Cons:
Motel style, not fancy
Other clientele can be iffy
TV channels are weird 
Plane take off path, but not that bad

My toddler daughter and I stayed for 3 nights. Check in was very pleasant, easy, and informative. They let us check in a little early because the room was ready. The other associate at the desk remembered my name and reassured me that my special request of a downstairs room had been filled. We got a map with our keys, and a reminder about when and where breakfast would be. 

Parking was easy for us. Not every room has a spot in front of it, but there is plenty of parking in my opinion. 

I stayed in room 409. The room was as clean as room of this motel style can be in a location like this. If you've stayed near the Strip in a chain motel then you'll understand what I mean. It was very clean considering how inconsiderate other guests can be. Nothing gross or unidentifiable, no weird stains, no weird smells. Not a hint of cigarette smoke. 

The bath was very clean. The shower has a curved bar and magnets in the bottom so it actually keeps water in. THE SHOWER ACTUALLY HAD PRESSURE AND HOT WATER AND DIDN'T JUST SHOOT OUT MIST. It was glorious. I actually got to rinse the conditioner out of my hair! All the fixtures worked, nothing was broken. There is a vanity area with a separate seat, lots of closet space, and good lighting. 

The kitchenette was not needed, but it had a 2 burner electric stove, a sink, and a ton of cabinet space. The microwave worked very well and was clean, and the mini fridge was as good as you find at most motels. It was clean with no weird smells. 

The AC was great. There's a guard on it to keep your curtains from flying up so people can't see in. It worked very well and wasn't too loud at all.

There's plenty of lighting and electrical outlets for charging phones etc. 

The beds are ok, but some people may not like them. I didn't hate them, but they are a little.... Spring-filled, haha. They never squeaked but they felt like they should. Regardless, we slept just fine on them and didn't have any problems. Bedding was clean, no sign of bugs anywhere (I always check), and the pillows were very nice. 

The TV is a little annoying because it has a lot of empty HD channels that just take up space and make it take forever to channel surf. I only mention this because kids can be super impatient... And some adults to, tbh. Otherwise lots of good channels and a decent sized TV. 

It was really quiet concerning other guests, except one family upstairs was having a door slamming competition, I think. But I couldn't hear anything from the other rooms like TV or talking, so that's all I care about. 

I know some people complained about the airplanes taking off, but that's really hit or miss depending on your room location and the time of day or night. I have lived by lots of airports and train tracks so they don't bother me. My 2 and a half year old slept through all the planes. Every one of them. So it really depends on your tolerance for noises. It can be loud, so use your bet judgement. 

There were some ""not sketchy but still smelled like weed"" types in the parking lot just going about their business, but that's sort of expected in Vegas and in this area, so that's not the motel's fault. And you gotta remember that this is Paradise, so you might have folks coming in from the street soliciting. Just say ""Sorry, man,"" and keep walking, and you should be fine. 

10/10 for me. Very good stay, and I would definitely stay again."
brIymVelhwqZkTfYOFm2CA,5,"We are are so pleased with the work California Closets did for our new home.  My husband worked with Simone in May to design our bedroom closet, pantry, linen closet and garage cabinets.  Simone did an amazing job understanding what we were looking for and delivering exactly what we needed.  They promised a two day turnaround on the installs and they kept that promise.  Simone is talented in her line of work and she delivers excellent customer service.  We would rate our overall experience with Simone beyond the 5 stars if Yelp allowed it.  Thank you Simone and California Closets for the wonderful job you did with our home! I'll add pictures over the next few days."

I have to agree the arctic swirl is the best around!!! I suggest you try the chocolate covered pretzel!!! YUMM-O!!!! Good prices and fantastic people working there!!!"
2F7iix7zJbFK-xEZBENF4Q,2,"Let me start off by, I had very high hopes for this place. I love fried chicken and I don't think it could ever be done wrong. However I was gravely mistaken. As I proceeded to order, they told me they were out of most items. Which was a huge disappointment to begin with. I ordered 3 pieces of chicken and two empanadas. As I bit in to the first empanada I realized the dough was raw, the inside was dry, and when I say dry I mean Sahara desert dry, this thing might as well have been named the ""dust bowl"" of the thirties. The crutch for this was the sauce, which was so sparse it might have well cost more than platinum, probably 5 drops at best in the tiny little cup they gave me.

I waited for the main course, 3 pieces of chicken. Everything looked alright, the first bite, very hot tender, but also under cooked. The batter had no seasoning, was basically just flower.... Huge disappointment. A 3 year old child could have made this for 50 cents. If this meal was 4$ I would have gladly taken the diarrhea I had afterwords and possibly come back for more, but only after a depressing day of beating myself up. However at a whopping 20+ dollars I think  I would need to have the worst day of my life and wanted to empty out all my accounts to come here. There are honestly way more choices for much less.

In my opinion, if you grew up in an Asian family and hear the word disappointment on the regular, this is the place to take your parents, maybe they will see you in a higher light by comparison. Or recommend this place to someone you really dislike but they don't realize it yet. Either way dollar for dollar I would go somewhere else, actually even if this place was free I would have to seriously consider somewhere else."
VJT6V3ju0qC1i6M27cD-og,5,"My husband and I were lucky enough to be recently introduced to Jason through our veterinarian's office, and I cannot say enough great things about him and his work.  When we took our dog Sugar Ray in for the shoot, we had no idea what to expect since we'd never had professional photos taken of a pet.  But Jason did an amazing job of getting Ray to play along, and the resulting photos were nothing short of spectacular.  He not only captured the spirit (and the handsomeness!) of our boy, he was such a nice guy and so great to work with.  We will be back for more photos for sure!"
hiP6M7nX1ClVAHe1XxgLFg,1,"I usually do not write reviews and even if I do, I never have written a bad review for any place so far. If there was 0 star option, I would choose that. I have been to this place many times since last year and it was fine all these times except my last visit. Since I have been there many times I know that one does not need to take an appointment.. you may have yo wait but thats been fine with me. Last Friday I went there to get my eyebrows & underarm waxing done. The lady who did my eyebrows did a really bad job.. like one eyebrow was visibly thinner than the other one! when I told her that its looking bad instead of saying sorry she goes ' but you wanted it thin!' To top it off she said she couldn't do my underarm waxing as they were busy with other customers. I was so pissed that I paid for the service and just walked out without giving any tip. Later I thought, I should have complained to the manager. Anyway I am NEVER going there again!!!"
xiPnPw1nawrGF-ibFqWcjw,3,"I am an occasional shopper at My Sister's Closet in Chandler.  In the past, I have been able to find some good deals there but have been overall put off by the staff repeatedly.  HOWEVER, today i went in and each and every salesperson i dealt with was very welcoming, friendly, helpful etc.  It was a noticeable and welcome change.  I asked the girl who rung up my purchase if they still have the same management and she said yes.  Anyway, Im not sure what happened to have such a significantly more pleasant experience,  but left feeling happy to shop there!"
4UM3cNLPgjj0e5jdxjvSRQ,5,"I love TruFusion! There are so many different classes offered everyday- my favorites are the heated barre and the hot power vinyasa. The instructors here are amazing and very friendly and always help provide modifications if you're a beginner. The studio itself is beautiful and kept very clean. There's classes pretty much all day, too, so there's never an excuse not to stop by and take a class!"
L0p2NJC7GEmBlcdhAy0EhQ,2,"My fiancé and I only came here because it was the only thing available at the time. No matter where I go, I always keep an open mind, especially at 130am. 

We were seated, went over the menu and I had a couple questions for our waitress. I asked if they could make a tuna sandwich instead of turkey. No, as we don't have tuna in the kitchen. Okay, that's fine. 

I kept on looking and saw a nacho appetizer. Awesome, I love nachos with some added chicken for protein. Joked with my fiancé saying she would say no again. I went ahead and asked, again, as I predicted, she said no. Not because there was no chicken in their kitchen, it was simply because they couldn't; didn't want to. 

I was already in a very shitty mood and had a blt sandwich. It was mediocre. 

In a city that has everything, this place in particular does not have the option to personalize. 

Anyone else that is looking for them to accommodate their simple food requests, go somewhere else. This place WILL NOT!"
6wiPzXkYbayk4n4j01Z-Pw,3,"Just what I was looking for. Tia Rosa has a great decor for a tourist type restaurant which is what I wanted. The service was good. An overly friendly waitress was just what I was looking for. We didn't order drinks so our dinner was delivered before the three of us got through our first round of chips and salsa. In fact our dinner came so fast we told the server that we were unsure if it was our order. Again fast food, we were hungry, just what we wanted. The food was good and there was plenty of it. That means take home boxes. Just what I was looking for."
E16pHq7d2Q-8B4wzKg92aA,5,"A buddy of mine and I stopped here on a layover in July. We both had a beer and shared a burger (came out to $50) and then jumped on our flight. 40 minutes later we were both puking our guts out.

S8OkB_xXYEyhBTuCIEH-Yg,1,The older lady with short curly hair would not let me up to my visit my friends room tonight. I had to wait in the lobby then she just refused me entry and went so far as to call security. Very bad experience. My friend and I will never stay here again. Also rooms are small.
xhtJfjlNbvGQdIhNGqor0g,5,"The filet mignon, shishito peppers, tuna tartare and oysters were amazing. The beer was amazing. The beer cellar was even more amazing. Our server, Bobby, was phenomenal! He made the beer cellar tour so memorable by telling us stories about the prohibition-era use of the building. He made perfect recommendations for cocktails and beer but more impactfully, really showed a passion for sharing his love of the history with his clients.

To add an additional comment, we forgot to get our receipt last night and we are on a business trip. We came back this afternoon and even though they aren't open til 5, they have another restaurant upstairs. We asked if there was any way they could get us a receipt when they opened and they said they could take care of it, so we left our phone number. While we were sitting there, our server Bobby had showed up to get his phone that he forgot. When we told him our dilemma, he told us he saved the receipt and brought it to us. Bobby is one of the best parts about this place and my experience was so awesome that I came back again tonight."
Q_26_WgpEiczc0uTEXizwA,3,Nice little Ice cream shop at the end of my street. We got two pineapple dole whips and a kids scoop of choc ice cream. I went back up and ordered a pint of this AMAZING pineapple ice cream. We spent about $15-16. Pricey for ice cream. The dol whips were pineapple just with ice and a twist of pineapple and vanilla ice cream. We though it would be better with out the ice. Since the pineapple ice cream is just a special I would much rather go to malleys in mentor or cp's in Willowick. If I'm feeling up to a drive the best two places IMO or mason's creamery in ohio city and Mitchel's in beachwood This place get's a two star for the price as they sell just your standard items the other 3/4 places I list make things from scratch and are better priced.
p1OxfqLl2polE3zJe75oSA,4,"This was a great bowling lane! Going inside was like going back in time. The atmosphere looked vintage, but was updated and clean! They had a sweet set up. I loved the old box computers used to keep score with the vintage animations. 

We took our two younger nephews with us, and they had a blast as well! Although they only had a couple kid friendly light bowling balls and 1 metal stand for them to push the ball down into the lane, we went at a slow time so we could use them. The prices were also cheap, but was cash only! They also had the usual sodas and some food items available for sale to snack on. We didn't walk back, but there was also a bar in the back. I would highly recommend this bowling alley! 

*they are cash only."
dkKtxTAYNzKYzwEc9aBC7A,4,I love this place. I work in the mall and consider this my go to! Only problem is the younger staff. Stephanie was so rude I almost canceled my order. She made me feel like ordering my food was a bother. However; I have had excellent service from the older staff members which I will make sure I ask for moving forward.

cEXgwSaEwHa4164uAW40Ug,1,"OMG was this place bad! I didn't mind the 2 drink min, which is less than the cover at some clubs, but A LOT the girls have been doing this so long that 2 mentioned they've done it for 30+ years!

Never have we been ripped off by a dancer before... My new wife wanted a $20 couch lap dance, but when the dancer took her to the ""VIA room"" and even though my wife told her she didn't have money for the VIP room, the dancer said, ""don't worry, I'll take care of you"".  How did she take care of my wife??? 3 dances later ""$120, thank you""...

Do yourself a favor and go to The Hustler (best club in town) or Sapphire, you'll be glad you did."
Dl_FHSHOpAn3356T-VM1qw,1,"I stopped in to the shop on a week day in the morning to discuss having a wedding cake done with them and to set up a tasting. They handed me a brochure and told me to look things up online. They told me to fill out their online form, which I did when I got home. I met Wade at the store and he said they were available on my wedding date. BUT I have not heard back from them! I received an email receipt for my online form request saying they'd get back to me in 48 hours... It's been exactly 2 weeks and ivd heard nothing. Disappointed to say the least."

Today I went with my usual one entree meal which included half in half fried rice/ chow mein and a side of orange and teriyaki chicken. I do like the quick convenience of getting the meal in a supply chain line! The food was as fresh and delicious as always! I also do think they have the best tasting passion fruit iced tea!

WfCW89tqb6Ylb6sNMAIWKg,1,"It was surprisingly busy when I first arrived on a rainy Wednesday evening. I didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was fully committed so the hostess mentioned there was open seating in the bar area. Perfect, I grabbed the last booth available. I waited for 10 minutes with servers constantly walking by me, I made eye contact with the bartender several times and I didn't even get acknowledged much less a glass of water. After waiting another few minutes my friend got up and grabbed a wine list from the bar. We had to go BACK to the bartender to ask a server to come over and take our drink order. I was really disappointed, I get better service at Applebee's. I won't be back."

The shop itself has a perfect layout to accommodate customers moving in and out. The flavors are spectacular and apparently change all of the time. My personal favorites were Salted Oreo and Dunkaroos (shoutout to my favorite snack in the 90's!). Job well done with this place. I wish we had one in Nashville!"
2nYMjXwjJ9txtx6cMMdhVw,4,"I'd like to rate it 4.5 stars, but YELP won't let me. We came here for breakfast this morning around 10ish, and it was really good. 

When we walked in, we were allowed to pick our seating and the server was quick to give us menus and offer us drinks. I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). 

I ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?

Our food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. 

Downside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....

Overall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. 

Would come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done."
bOCyd9LVJt8S5wf8WIEwCg,5,Didn't know it was vegan when I walked in but I walked out a happy (and well fed) camper. The menu is jammed with all kinds of delicious sounding options. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they offer green juice shots (the bitter-but-good-for-you kind) with a pomegranate juice chaser. Nice touch! Food is excellent and very fresh. Server was incredibly helpful for my first time there. I will definitely be back!

S_kjpwdVYQBDWcm-vcYRAw,2,"I wanted to love it or even like it but none of those happened.  We ordered 5 meats and 4 sides so that we could have many choices to decide upon our favorites.  First off, the turkey was almost inedible.  The odd seasoning didn't allow me to even finish one slice.  The brisket had almost no flavor and was full of fat and the same goes for rib tips.  The larger ribs lacked flavor. The pork had the most flavor of all the meat we tried but, again, it was fatty.  I don't know what their cooking methods are but I would guess that they boil the meat before smoking it.  When meat is smoked for a long time, flavor develops and the fat melts away during the slow cooking process.  There was way too much fat in the meat and the lack of flavor makes me believe that they are boiling it.  Good barbecue is flavorful and delicious. This was not.  Our sides were collard greens which were okay, mac and cheese, again, just okay, house slaw, okay, and corn bread which was delicious.  Yes, delicious!. 

The decor is really appealing and creatively done.  

We didn't complain about the food because we realize that they obviously think it's great or they wouldn't have the restaurant.   

The bathroom floor was clean but not the toilet or dirty, slow draining sink.  There was dirt around the faucet and around the sink that obviously had been there a while. The dirt around the faucet would need weeks to get that bad, so I cleaned it, and the garbage can lid was filled with dust and dirt--gross, I wasn't touching that.  

What does the kitchen look like?

We all agreed that this would not be a place to frequent again.  And sadly, I cannot recommend it."
pw_i26d8t8vHHh1rg96qHg,3,Liberty Market has some great food and some okay food choices. The cortado drink is the BOMB.
C-OTetnkT8WuUImBwatIjw,4,"Been to vegas quite a few times, first time to Paris. Rooms were really nice, atmosphere was good, layed back, older crowd. The  Mona Mi restaurant is a must, if you like Filet Minot. Get a table outside if it is nice and you can watch the water show across the street."
dXXlD4Yjx_lIWoNaPwORhA,1,"I wish I could give 0 stars... and I like to think I am very fair with my ratings, if you see my previous ones... I am in customer service, I like to think I am a very understanding customer.

Long story short, I have bad credit that I have been working on repairing for the past several years. I understand that with bad credit, it's hard to get much of anything... So now that my current car that I have purchased several years ago (and PAID OFF) had an A/C that wasn't repairable for the 2nd summer living in Phoenix, I decided it was time for a new car. 

I saved up well over $1,000.00, knowing I have bad credit and would need something to negotiate from a buy here pay here place. I found the Simple Car store from an ad they posted in Craigslist, and it appealed to me because they were close to my work and reported positive to credit card companies (apparently).

Last Thursday, July 30th, I went in, and was told I was ""Preapproved"" and could test drive any car in the lot. I was told with my amount down and what I was looking for (type of cars, payments, etc) that it would be ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM getting me a car, even today if I wanted.

I test drove two vehicles, one 2007 Pontiac G6 with 108k miles on it and also test drove a 2006(if I remember the year) Chevy Cobalt ..... The cobalt was in terrible shape, I can't believe they didn't clean up the interior better honestly. I told the girls after test driving both and looking at the other cars they had on the lot that the G6 would be the only one I was interested in honestly.

I was asked to talk with Alex, whom I was told was the sales manager. She did the paperwork, I gave her all of the personal information she asked me for and said I was APPROVED. I quickly called my boyfriend to come look at the vehicle and bring down a small amount of cash so we could put a hold on the car.... at this point it was too late in the evening to coordinate insurance, so I wanted to complete the sale the next day. I was asked to put $100 down on the car and she would have everything ready for me the next day. I was even given copies of the car info, the carfax, and the loan details that I was ""approved"" for from their financing since I had to do in-house financing with my credit. 

The next day at work there was so much back and forth details it was RIDICULOUS. I put the insurance on the car, only to have Alex text me in the middle of my work day to explain her OWNER declined my loan because of my work history (I just started a new job) and that I needed a cosigner? I ended up leaving work early just so I could go down and see just exactly what was going on..... THIS WAS RAISING A TON OF RED FLAGS FOR ME.

Let me point out also that their ads say all you need is $500 down. Alex tried saying I wanted the most expensive car on the lot so she would have to put me in something cheaper (aka the piece of crap filthy cobalt or something similar on their minimal lot)..... Not to mention the Kelly Blue Book price of the Pontiac G6 was $2,000.00 lower then what they were asking for, even at other dealerships in town and even at other buy-here-pay-here dealerships.

After we got back into this dealership, she said I would need to provide more money down to even get considered. I told her we could do this... We re-negotiated this Loan that I was already supposedly ""Approved"" for ((this is called a yo-yo scam people, look it up)).... After making us wait for an hour, she came back to tell me that once again I was denied the options I was trying to offer to work with THEM.... I thought dealerships were supposed to work with YOU??? I asked she refund the HOLDING FEE that I put down of $100 back on to our credit card and we walked out.....

THIS IS THE REASON I DECIDED TO PUT A BAD REVIEW TO THIS COMPANY ALSO:

Guys, I went to Cactus Jack's Auto, because they posted an ad on Craigslist for the same car: a 2007 Pontiac G6.... The one I ended up purchasing from Cactus Jacks the VERY NEXT DAY had over 20,000 less miles, and was actually $1,500.00 CHEAPER... The loan process took me literally 1 hour, I was approved and driving my new (better) car home. I ended up putting less money down and my payment/loan amount was for half of the time/durration then the one offered to me at ""SIMPLE-RIP-OFF-BULLCRAP-Car-STORE""...

I know its hard if you have bad credit or are trying to fix your old bad credit. Don't feel like you aren't worth it to still shop around and find a better place. They are out there, and this dealership IS NOT ONE OF THEM....."
x9HA8t8AZJR2k-ConwChIA,5,"Budget Blinds were great!  We were in the process of purchasing a new house, and wanted to have plantation shutters installed.  As we all know, these are quite expensive.  I was all set to order them through an online distributor and install them myself, but decided to get a quote from Ryan at Budget Blinds.  Turns out his quote for plantation shutters was the same price installed as it would cost me to order them and install them myself!!  They were also substantially cheaper (by several thousand dollars) than going through Home Depot or Lowe's.  And these are Hunter-Douglas shutters, not some inexpensive knock-off.  He also suggested some good solutions for our large sliding glass door, and we have been very happy with our choices.  In addition, there is no pressure to ""up-sell"" you at all.  All of his suggestions were right on the money and were very reasonable.  Installation went very smoothly, and all the window treatments have been in place for over a year and we are very happy with them.  I would not hesitate to use Ryan at Budget Blinds again!"
ZT1bdUjjweQKSBeS7J2gtw,2,This is a great restaurant if you like to wait 2 hours for your food and at least 1 hour for a bowl of queso and eating chips for that hour. My food was subpar at best. The chicken was chewy and dry the corn was as mushy as an old couch left on the side of a road. Hey at least the  fries were hot! All in all don't come here if you have no patience.
t-ikZEE2VZodjnwh2JMYYw,5,The best off the menu spicy shrimp I have ever had!!!!!!!  And I am old!!!!!!  Great place!  Great Service!  Ask for the Cameron's Ala Diablo OMG the best and I'm from Los Angeles Ca!  You will love it!!!
15QfoOZy40TbXAUM6z4iPQ,3,"I'm not a huge meat-eater, so I'm going to focus on the veggies for this review....and, comparing them to Mac's down the way since that is my favorite BBQ joint.

Amazing fresh, seasoned crinkle-cut fries. I mean, they're crinkle-cut fries, but try them. Seriously. I've never had Mac's fries, but I doubt they get much better than this.

Lightly battered yet crispy and flavorful fried pickles (edged out Mac's for my number 1 fried pickle, which was not an easy decision!)

Fried corn-good, but with the French fries and fried pickles, I probably would have enjoyed this corn freshly steamed/grilled better. Add salt-it makes it yummier. 

Macaroni and cheese. Not bad, uses more of a cheese sauce than melty/crusty/baked cheese. I prefer the latter, and depending on the day (i.e. Mac's isn't skimping on the cheese), Mac's has them beat.

The collard greens were sweet and yummy, but I felt like the serving was a little small. Mac's has a little more spice and tang to the sweetness, adding depth of flavor, but I did enjoy them and would order them again.

The baked beans were just okay to me. They had a little extra BBQ or smoked flavor, but they didn't stand out to me. I happen to love Mac's baked beans so the bar was very high, but I'd probably give them a 5/10, whereas Mac's gets a 10 out of 10 for me.

My son got the beef brisket the first time we went, but it was pretty fatty and from my perspective Mac's has amazing brisket. I got turkey the last time I went and it was okay, a little dry. The BBQ sauce was good though, which made up for it, almost.

Overall Sauceman's will be added to our list of BBQ choices, but probably only when I'm craving their fries and pickles."
LK66rJWC24_m3a21bveaKw,4,"This is probably my go to hot pot... it's a shame it's so far! Was here this past Saturday and left super satisfied!

The Tom yum soup did need a bit more flavour but nothing that fish sauce couldn't fix! 
Food came super fast many great selections!"
devo2-0V7JoVquasKQFPCA,3,Stopped in here last Friday with some friends. It's an ok little dive bar. Drinks weren't overly priced or too crowded. Can tell a lot of regulars go there because when we walked in everyone in the bar (which wasn't a lot) looked at us for a moment. The bartender seemed like a jerk at first but warmed up after a bit. One pool table and the music was in my taste so that's a plus. Didn't eat but maybe next time...
_tztfo5KfF4z2qichaZRSA,5,My phone is like brand new now ! I'm always on my phone and my clients can't get ahold of me with a broken LCD screen . I paid a fair price and my phone was done in 40mins. So worth the wait . Supper supper friendly too I will deff be back ! Thank you
9E01pW8fT-rzO8aH4nl0ww,5,"I would definitely recommend to any expecting mommies to consider giving birth here! Just got discharged yesterday, got admitted Monday night and my stay here was AMAZING! The nurses were very positive, helpful and always with a smile on their face. It was my first born and i needed a lot of help with latching my baby on to breastfeed all the nurses were very helpful and understanding. I wish i wouldve remembered their real names but one was Pamela ( day shift ) and the other was Tess ( night shift )  . No matter how many times i would call them for help they never got bothered and that made me feel very comfortable being a new mom. If i ever get pregnant again i would MOST DEFINITELY be chosing sunrise  !!"
MTYY4jDtKfTh3TmqRWHVKA,3,"This Longos has a very helpful staff and an excellent selection of top notch fruits and vegetables     It has developed though significant problems....Their pricing organization is terrible.   The posted price may not be what it costs at the checkout and the economy size either by weight or by item may be more expensive than the smaller size.   Yesterday I bought margarine and milk and when I got home found that both were past the best before date.  Also they often are out of stock of 2 items that I buy fresh.  When I've questioned them about it, they have said that they order it from central but it isn't delivered.   I live close by and as I said  it does have its positives.    But I'd advise to be careful when shopping here.
      LONGOS....this needs fixing!!!!"
BfUp5KlrKoy7pSv4tNyvfg,2,"We've been here twice, but never again after our last experience this Saturday evening. 

The first time we visited this place it was late afternoon in early December 2016. We were still able to order off the lunch menu and got happy hour drink prices. Our group of 4 ordered a variety of pizzas and sandwiches with beer, wine and drinks. The combination of less expensive lunch prices and happy hour drink specials reduced the bill sufficiently to satisfy us for the just okay food. I would rate the lunch experience 3 stars.

This Saturday our same group of 4 arrived for an early dinner. We requested to sit inside because the wind was gusting up to 45 miles an hour outside. Once we were sat, we discovered that they had their fans blowing on high, so it was as if we were sitting in the wind. It took a while to get someone's attention (not our server, who was MIA most of the meal) and they finally turned down the fans. None of us liked our entrees. One entrée was sent back because the fish was severely overcooked and chicken marsala was ordered in its place. The marsala was in a sauce thickened with corn starch - seriously?? Is this a cheap Chinese restaurant? My NY Clam Sauce was too thin and the pasta was undercooked and served in a big clump. Neither of our dinning companions cared for their dishes either. I would rate the dinner experience 1 star.

This is not real Italian food - not even close. The food just isn't any good and it's WAY overpriced for what you get. You can tell that there is no love or care that goes in to the preparation of the food. That whole attitude spreads through the entire experience and leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially once you pay the outrageous bill."
QuwF3OcQbjlab7_ODfW3lA,4,"Very nice to have this ice cream parlor in South Pointe Resort and Casino when traveling with a family.  The kids were very excited.  Quite a bit of flavors to choose from although my girls decided to be plain and tried the two vanilla flavors.  I split the Kona Coffee ice cream with grandma.  The servings are huge especially for the price you pay for it!   For a single scoop which is more like a double scoop at other ice cream shops, you can definitely share with someone.  A great find and worth checking out!!"
8dhyHdt5UY0frAx-XdHzUQ,4,"Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that they forgot my coffee order on my last visit.  Otherwise it's a great place.  Excellent atmosphere.  Casual laid back hipster kinda vibe.  Delicious food .  Will come here for drinks at some point.  

Great art by local artists as well."
chRt9m9V816F35887zx0rg,1,"Worst customer service EVER!! Line was long and very slow, but even worse, after we ordered our donuts we were told to have a seat and they will bring it out. We waited for over 20min after ordering and watched them serve several people at the register after us. I returned to counter to inquire about our order and was told they lost our ticket on the floor and just served the last of what we ordered to the people behind us. The manager did nothing to resolve the situation despite our near hour wasted at there cafe. I was refunded my money with an uncaring apology as the manager then turned to the girl at the register and said ""it's ok, don't worry about it""  I understand mistakes happen, but this is just not the way to make things right and gain a new customer. Very disappointed"

Great wune selection. I visited in February and it was absolutely perfect weather to sit outside. Fun you can bring your dogs, too. Wish I lived closer because I would be a regular."
Ig8uTr6u_MfQRqjtjPWclA,5,"Pleasantly surprised to find this among all the bubble tea shops here in Pacific Mall! This Real Fruit is located upstairs in the food court and uses fresh tea and fruits in all their drinks.

We ordered the special fresh Mango Diamond Slush with pearls. It's essentially a mango slush with fresh mango chunks on the bottom. The best part, it was 2 for $5 only!!

Great deal tucked in the deeper parts of P-mall for sure!"
Wb7icYmxWSGpVnOqCD0_Cw,3,"I do love their ticket waiting system so we don't have to wait in line for hours. When we arrived at 4:30pm thinking the line will be shorter we later found out we have to take a ticket and return on the time it tells us to which was 6pm. Not thrilled about it but better than standing in line.
We dined at the Wynn and Bellagio buffet so we though this should be similar price and quality. $140 for 2 people!!! It almost made me want to walk away!
Food quality and selection is good but $70 a person is still a lot for a buffet. I will suggest you to come try it once but be prepared for the ticket shock. 
I know some people compare the price with a fine dinning restaurant and think it's a good price but I compare it with other Vegas buffet and think it's not worth the wait and the money."
RQlf7znHhUfh4yWZzqAkXA,5,"I found it difficult to find this place, wish I had a GPS device at the time.  But it was well worth seeking out.  Thai dishes that I had never heard of before  I never knew that there was such a thing as Thai sausage!.  Each and every dish one was delicious.

I hope I have a chance to return here."
2zHoqO8UaU5fgUhl3TlYyQ,4,A cute spot to hang out and enjoy desserts & drinks. The green tea crepe cake is delicious and a must try!
a5BLeyP8XM6m2K1oX15F6A,5,"Since the closing of B-Dubs next door, this has become more of a favorite hang out! When I was a kid and we'd come to town on vacation (and I had a huge crush on Thunder Dan), we'd always go to the downtown location.  Now that I live in the West Valley and Majerle's is a 5 minute drive...I'm there often!

As mentioned in a few other reviews, the Gorilla Wings live up to their name! They're huge in size and in flavor.  The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer is freakin' phenomenal as well! You can get any of their sauces on the shrimp, so you can try something different each time.  Their fries are awesome, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  

As for entrees, they have a killer Ruben sandwich and their pastas are really good as well.  

A full bar and wall to wall tv's makes this a great place to catch a game any night of the week.  

I'm still waiting to catch a glimpse of Thunder Dan himself, and hopefully this time I won't make a food out of myself and completely freeze up like the one time I met him! ;-)"
Ni0Ct0OXsJF71MNGzYsU_Q,4,"This has been where I go to get checkups for about two years now. I'm looking for a new place. 

I usually wait about forty minutes, sometimes longer, after showing up on time. During the exam, we switch rooms and I get to wait some more, while dilated so I can't read and it's boring as hell. 

I get a detailed examination from a nurse and then Dr. Biber breezes through in a few minutes. I don't feel like I'm getting enough information about my eyes. 

There's usually a surprise ""hey this one thing we did wasn't covered by your insurance"" on the way out (2/3 of the last times I've been I think, different things each time). It would be cool if they let me know that before they did the procedure.

This last thing won't apply to most people who go there, but they recommended an expensive surgery to make my eyes better. Dr. Biber said 70% chance I would be able to see well again. Then on the day of the surgery, they tell me ""oh this is only to keep them from getting worse, there's a very small chance of improvement"". 

So I still can't see well. And that sucks.

Edit: Would highly recommend Complete Eye Care instead; I went to them next and it was great."
Wg_qFDGqM-Yvse4rCyafHg,5,Good family restaurant with good Italian food. Loved the homemade meatballs!  I had baked rigatoni and my son ordered chicken parm. We had leftovers for days.
zEXoIc1hDlbeVMacHoFCXQ,4,"This used to be a Hooters? It's unrecognizable now. 

With the move to this location, my little slice of alcoholism is just across the street now. 

A great new stage, many new TVs, shiny bar. I rarely am able to get a seat at the bar now, as business seems to have jumped. I'll have to nail a plaque with my name to one of the chairs and perma-reserve it. 

Also included are Big Buck Hunter (Admit it: After a few beers, we all go into redneck mode and want to shoot at things), Foosball, and Golden Tee.  

A new royalty program has also been introduced. $10 gets you $5 Bass Head all the time, discount on food, and a key chain that's individually numbered. 

I'd  like to respond to Cameron's note (I approved it and it's on my list) I've been a regular since May. Do some research before making yourself look like an idiot. I don't work there.

The food is terrific (Brisket beef dip melts in your mouth), though I do hope they pop in a macaroni and cheese dish for added deliciousness. 

Live bands, great food, great staff. The only thing that changed is the location. Awesome just got a bit more awesome-er-ernesser. So...ummm...yeah."

pV3R2XtC75hAaMZJtZ6PTg,5,"We came here for dinner because we got a complimentary meal for two guests. We decided to eat here because it was closer to Excalibur and we were over there looking around. 

It was the worst meal ever. Everything was way too salty and some of us ended up going to the restroom RIGHT AFTER. Doesn't that tell you something?

What I really appreciated was they didn't have any french fries and my brother LOVES french fries so our server went to tell the chef to make us some french fries. She brought this big bowl of french fries and I really appreciate this kind gesture. The amount of fries was enormous and the fries were pretty salty but the gesture was hands down out of this world. I could not believe the kindess we got from the server. 

The stars were judged solely on their food, customer service is 10 stars!"

We ordered very forgettable food, and I remember my breakfast bowl was out of avocados, so I just told the person behind the counter to 'surprise me' with an alternative (I think I got extra of something altho I couldn't tell).

I also had an ice coffee which was fine, nothing to rave about.  Just an A-OK spot from my experience, location and emptiness left it feeling very odd that its 4.5 stars as of this review."
RiZvFpvRzwQtH1I5mtj2mw,5,"* Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. * 

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef ""devil dawgs"" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either."
cG_mTSO0SQu3BPhqXXKWaQ,1,"I would rate it 0 stars but that's not possible. Every time I have come here I have been treated badly. Gave the dj $15 on an extremely slow Sunday to play a song. The night ended and he never played the song. When I asked for my money back, essentially was told to f**k off. Only good thing about this place is the taco truck connected to it. Other than that, I plan on avoiding this place like and STD, which you might get simply by waking in."

I highly recommend seeing Brittany if you want the hair you've always dreamed of she is great with beaded Weft extensions, as well as color and cuts."
F60f_zAr7lQFRnGjiyF_hQ,1,"We should have known as they were wide open for breakfast and Mon Ami Gabi had a 30 minute wait right across the square!  

This sums it up - asked the waiter if he could ""Hold the home fries with my quiche"", and he responded, ""I'll have to ask the chef.""  I guess the chef was in a bad mood because I got the home fries with my quiche!  Doesn't stop there ... was never offered more coffee (one cup of their crap was enough ... how you ruin Pete's is beyond me).  I literally had to get up and walk some around to find someone to bring me coffee. 

Don't go there!  Stand in line and wait for Mon Ami Gabi or ANYWHERE ELSE!"
E50si4fKk1F6cG6rMxqqqQ,1,"Feels like I just got ripped off. $10.65 for a small 11"" pepperoni pizza and a drink. Usually 2 real slices and a drink for $6 any where else."
kBQj_RY6dcTiv-L_SyhQJg,1,"You don't want to shop here. You pay extra for the name thinking you will get great after sales purchase but if something goes wrong make sure you bring your wallet. Ask about the warranty before buying, apparently working in an office may be considered "" vigorous "" activity."
RC8-gkRQzG1iIHqk06Epfw,3,"My kids had a lot of fun they loved it. It's $20 per bracelet I think that's the best deal instead of buying tickets. We were here for about 3 hours and they got on all the rides more than twice the lines were not that long  but when we were leaving I noticed the lines were very long so if you're trying to avoid the lines I would suggest to come during the day. The rides are a little outdated but my kids still loved them. They have the usual foods funnel cakes, hot dogs, pizza nothing special water is $2 but you can bring your own. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because some of the staff was rude, the girl at the register seemed mad and was giving us attitude for asking how much the bracelets cost lol but other than that we had fun and was a cute place to bring the kids."
JZdOSL9lz4Iur6g3HDM1_w,5,"By far my favorite breakfast in Vegas. Try the Gaucho sandwich... steak, egg... wow! Had one this morning"
qnXqWd2FK5_TCyctKLtVSw,3,"I finally got an order! Lolbs... I say that because I had tried several times to come here, but they were closed whenever I'd think of them or they don't answer their phones when I've called to expedite service. So I hopped in the car & drove on over alone. Coming from North Las Vegas down Lamb to this side of town is a drastic change in environment. For Chicago people let me describe this as coming from Oak Brook to the worst Chicago project ever. I saw drug transactions, several prostitutes w/ass hanging out their dresses. It was a very LIT environment.  I'm from the hood, never above the hood, but just be aware!

The environment clearly doesn't deter patrons, at 130ish the place was still jumping with new and old customers. I browsed the menu and decided on 20pc wing lemon pepper & flaming hot, 2pc chicken snack, & a side order of gizzards. YES, IT WAS ALL MINE! Hell I wanted to try it all just in case I never come back, lol. After a 20min wait my order was ready, the lady shows you your order to confirm accuracy, so when looking at mine I don't see my flaming hot wings. I don't recall if she rang them up or not and after the hunger pains & long ass wait I don't inquire I grab my shit & go! 

Driving back down Lamb I'm eating omw too and I started w/the gizzards. Very fresh & hot! I didn't like the seasoning they added to them. I would've preferred none or lemon pepper, so those got disgarded quickly. Next I hit the lemon pepper wings FRIED TOO HARD! Taste was very good, but they should've been pulled up sooner. I saved the last 2pc chicken snack which was a thigh & leg for last. It was extra fresh & juicy, but again that seasoning from the gizzards was present. It's like a chipotle seasoning that's gross to me. So I ate the thigh, but nothing else. I left the rest for my kids who didn't eat any of it. Lol I would return for the flavored wings only. I almost forgot to write this review, which isn't good. Service was ok, quick in and out nothing major stood out."
5xY6yAtsO0SAQwxl-5grFg,5,I absolutely love this place yes the food is amazing I've posted before it's an amazing great hole in the wall because it's true this is definitely some of the best Mexican food and go figure I'm not even Mexican and Colombian
0xQqqNv7h7jPGSZKu8m57w,5,Always a great place to meet up with friends for a drink or a quick bite. Great atmosphere and the food is out of this world! Highly recommend!
pTcQQGcxIqYkFJxn7Lolvg,5,"Best pizza in the area by far. No comparison. No argument. In fact it is the only pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh that actually tastes like it is supposed to taste. Also, prices are very reasonable and delivery was very quick. Ny style with pepperoni was good and the Chicago style although it was kind of just a thick pizza (no butter crust) was very flavorful. 

I will get from here now on. Never crossed my mind to try them because I usually order from eat24 or GrubHub. I'm also from NY like the previous reviewer and I agree that this place is very good and most other places in North hills are just not that great"
aTRU6ACI3x0Jo73SmhtgtA,1,Never again. I usually always pay for a deluxe package but didn't have time. So I get the bill and they nickeled and dimed me to death. Charged for callus removal an additional fee and charged me to remove a bit of gel polish let on 4 toes. They charged $8.00 for that alone and $5.00 to fill in acrylic  on 3 toes. Unbelievable this place can go $%^& themselves. Additionally it was the worst service. I felt like it was the person's first time. Really really upset.
d9Jg8Glr8PyvInAVJxWAEA,5,I have been going to this restaurant since 2005 and they have always been friendly with delicious food. They have a great salad bar and their hibiscus drink is one that always needs to be large!
7hB7Z6hS20g6MrMkkSykWw,1,"The first picture posted here for this business fooled me, gave me the impression that this place is huge & massive, beautiful and spacious patio, must be crazy busy affording all of that, with some great menu selections as they're claiming a franchise name/brand that is very well known in the middle-east for being a leader in this category.

Once you walk in, you get shocked and slapped in the face for a strong reminder not to believe what you see and read online!

The place is literally 5-10 tables max, with a ""second floor"" that's like a private hidden place! For WHAT?! I have no clue!

The place smells beyond unacceptable, it looks and feels so dirty..
I obviously didn't try their food for obvious reasons, but tried a quick hookah for about 30 minutes, and it's nothing different from the whole experience.

Service consists of a teenage girl and an old man who turned out to be the owner of the place!

How can such places exist in the GTA in 2018!? That is beyond me!"
ET-07omhEpeQPBmZZWKqEg,2,Average.  Been here numerous times over the years and the past couple of times have been so so.  Probably won't be back
pRCVNY8BjcwWxf4PZFlpvQ,2,Went in this morning to get a new phone and the sales rep helped us. Not the brightest crayon in the box. She didn't ask which number I was using but I assumed because my name was on the papers she was upgrading the phone to my number. My name goes with my phone number on the account but no she gave me my grandmother's number. I am livid.
KUaK9lVMQAmGogqDAp_AYg,3,DO NOT GO HERE FOR THE FOOD! It's pretty bad! But the overall experience is fun and you will certainly have a laugh!
ncemhSO1xDQEzrD98R_yvg,4,"I've been a fan of green grotto since going to the one in Markham.

The interior is very cozy and is a good spot to sit with friends.  At night it can get very busy and hard to find a seat (especially weekend nights).

I always order their Hokkaido milk tea.  Its delicious!
They also give a small complimentary bucket of popcorn when you sit in.

They have free WiFi which is good if you want to sit in with your laptop.

My friends and I have been coming quite a bit and will continue you to come back!"
lZije1EVRUNt5swLRniOpQ,5,This place did not disappoint. The service was great. The food was good. The wait was not long. It's a must try of you're in Vegas.

NZuUcf__2AfOrmxgxNH7og,3,"Had a corned beef sandwich and coffee.  The corned beef was good.  They need to add a value proposition or wow factor, then this will be a great place.  My suggestion would be to charge a couple dollars more for the sandwich and throw in the sides.  $2.50 ea for a side of potato salad or coleslaw, yeeks.  Thats $5 for typical sides with a corned beef sandwich thats already $9.00, Mound the corned beef, give a bit of value.  When you are eating there I do not like the idea of paying when you order.  I also thought it was a bit insulting to be asked for a dollar for a refill of my coffee.  This could be a great place with a few little ""value"" improvements.  Service and value need work."
YeQ9NfWRJQbjMz2DVwc_3w,4,"Fantastic selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles. Definitely more of a sports bar environment which is ok. The food is reasonably priced and very tasty. Had a burger that was absolutely fantastic. It came tots that I I thought were kinda bland, but a little salt and ketchup takes care of that. Parking is tricky during busy times since it's inside of a strip mall. I'd definitely have no problems coming back here again."
B4WWe2SiBtafwKDOrGbfaw,1,"Oh Dear!

I was so wanting to like this place - close to my home, with a 'no fuss' appearance.  And the Cricket (on the big-screen TV) was quite a fun surprise. 

The place could use a bit of help on the 'atmosphere' front ... I think for the whole time of my meal, there was some non-descript sitar music playing in the background, and some of the staff looked like their mother had just died ... but I could live with that if the food were ok. 

I ordered Lamb Vindaloo.  It was awful. Vindaloo is notorious for being hot (spicy hot), so when I order it, I don't mind if the waiter verifies I want it hot, but if they don't ask (they didn't this time) I expect to have a mouth-burning experience.  It was utterly bland.  Not only was it bland, but it was lacking in any of the 'vinegar' flavor I've experienced with all the Vindaloo's I've had elsewhere.  My other dish was ok, and the papadums were good, and the rice and Naan bread were good, so I won't go below 3 stars but - quite frankly, my meal wasn't a 3 star meal."
7QLqz8BPZfR1tEZL3YMZXA,3,"Coming from a students perspective, it has mixed reviews. The class itself was wonderful and informative and I'd highly recommend even if one was over 18! The in car lessons were a different story however. I expected to be treated with the same respect as in the classroom but this was far from the case. I was yelled at constantly and even many times brought me to a point where i was uncontrollably sobbing. I didn't think a man could be so heartless to a person. It became so bad that I was terrified to even get in the car. I'm not sure how the other instructors were but John is definitely the worst human I've ever met. If one were to schedule in cars here please save yourself the trouble and schedule with someone who is not John."
by6RwN64Cez3KXuqxRpwEw,4,"I attended the Bellagio's buffet for a wedding dinner. This was my first time in Vegas so this experience was new for me. First thing first, the waitresses were nothing short of amazing. With a party of about 35-50 people, they never ceased being attentive and hospitable. Not to mention that we all had the unlimited drink special for $14.99 and they never lost a beat. The ambience, food and drinks were all amazing. There are many many options on the buffet so choosing what to eat can be a bit overwhelming. Be sure to save room for dessert! There's plenty to choose from."
9zoJDmVbq1fU8TBQKZ-mXQ,3,"My friends and I went down to watch the UFC and grab some food. We had the Nachos, Wings, and Burgers. Best tasting was the cracked peppercorn burger. 

On the plus side...Service was friendly . 

Too bad the food was so mediocre. I really think they could bump it up a notch or maybe they are forced to follow a corporate menu.

Lots of TV though to watch the fights."
5b8LeatXwzEDhdbbocfAlw,5,"Please accept this short testament of a very personal nature that speaks to the Village at Lakewood's staff.

This has absolutely nothing to do w/ bathroom tub caulking; ceiling fan squeaks; pristine pool facilities; loud or quiet neighbors; excessive leaf blowing vs. excessive leaves; excellent, exclusive, taxpayer-rebate-funded (parochial/cult) schools vs. traditionally funded and notoriously neglected (pubic) schools for normal kids; creepy cupboard crawlies or any other such weighty matters.

I'd like to thank Wes, a member of the Village at Lakewood office staff, for his professional and discrete handling of an extremely urgent matter that a clearly distraught, non-resident walk-in dumped on his Monday morning desk.

Without hesitation and with some authority (no doubt guided by his years of industry experience) Wes rose to the occasion, followed procedure, enlisted the resources of the community, directed activities as necessary and calmly offered comfort and assistance to this complete stranger under duress.

Here's where I pull off my ""Undercover Boss"" disguise and present Wes with a full year membership to the ""Jelly of the Month Club"", right?  Hold on a sec...

That was real life on the phone.  They're out of jelly.  So I'll leave you with this instead:

Imagine how well the actual Village at Lakewood tenants are served if the Village staff perform this highly for a stranger in need.

Thank you, Wes and Village management for your assistance."

ol6GagJHrmArnM8Gdj9Kvw,2,"Two times we have been, the first 'D'vine' the second, total
service and kitchen dysfunction.
The good news, you can definitely get a table here at peak brunch times and they have a patio, but you may never receive a refill of coffee, the syrup for your chicken and waffles, and the wrong eggs on your meal.

Still new, still rocky, a 14 year old bus boy, but the servers are all really nice, just no one is designated to one table and everyone is trying to cover all aspects of service, but somehow still missing everything."
7oOhiFwBClXDfyIOxQ2zFA,1,"Tried this place due to the fact that my regular Thai place was closed.  Huge mistake! They wouldn't allow us to bring our own bottle of wine, even after stating that we would pay a corking fee.  They ran out of duck, and calamari.  Then came back later to tell us they found calamari.  My seafood dish had catfish that was slimy and disgusting, and the squid was rubber.  Seriously like a tire. They use red pepper flakes to spice their food not thai chilies.  If I wanted crushed red pepper I would go to a pizzeria not a thai restaurant where I'm looking for aromatic flavors.  They had a crowd so people didn't seem to care, but I know better."

We found stripburger which was right at the corner from our hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted with friendly smiles and a very attentive staff. We ordered the usual burgers, fries and shakes that had alcohol in them, which were very delicious. Our burgers were huge and EXTREMELY tasty. Our waitress was awesome, very friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. Only complaint I had were the fries... they were too salty for me and opulent even eat more than 10. Which is very unlike me because I love fries! Other than that small blemish this place was good and not too busy or loud."
pGyLiMjyXtU3gh9_qQpO4g,4,"Well well well, Hole In The Wall Crab Shack...nice to meet you! 

I'm so glad I finally got a chance to scurry on over here for a quick lunch. And oh wow was it delicious and the portions were a plenty. Since I don't want to sound like a review on repeat here are the highlights of my meal...

Crab cake: Zowie. One of the best crabby cakes I've ever had. Large, burstin' with flavor and SO full of crab. I'm not quite sure what type of magic holds all the crab together but it's insanely good. Mama likes! 

Hush puppies: Perfectly fried balls of joy. Yes, balls of joy. Wonderfully brown and crispy on the outside and a lovely spongy and delightful inside. I plowed through three of 'em so quickly.  

Broccoli: Yeah, I did it. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I subbed in broccoli and it was super good. I'm sure it wasn't the most healthy broccoli I've ever eaten but it was spiced and cooked just right. No limp broccoli trees here! 

The staff: Seriously some of the nicest owners & staff around. Super chatty, funny & kind. They are really happy to tell you how they get those fresh crabs every week, too! Yeah, you just want to hug 'em - both for their disposition and for their delicious food. 

Miscellaneous: As others have noted, at the moment there is no place to sit and chow. They might be moving to a new location, so keep your eyes posted if and when the address changes! Also, prepare to pay a bit more than you may be used to but the food is a) outstanding and b) very, very fresh so it's worth it. 

I'll be back to try more of the menu very, very soon!"
qIURNTvpI6syJzaD3wfmow,5,"I realized when I was preparing to deploy overseas for several months that while it sounded morbid, I should probably do some estate planning in case anything happened to me, or in case something came up in my personal affairs while I was gone that I was unable to take care of. 

A fellow volunteer at an event I was working on mentioned that her husband did estate planning and it might be worthwhile to check out even though I am in the east valley and the office was in Glendale. 

I can assure you it was such an easy and carefree experience that I cannot believe I was actually seeing a lawyer. I always pictured it being so complicated and expensive and having things said to me I wouldn't understand without use of a legal jargon dictionary. However, Heath sat down with me and discussed the different types of documents that were available and what they were used for as well as answered any questions I had in regard to them. He also asked questions about my affairs in order to create the documents needed. Ends up I just needed a simple estate planning package with a few different documents. 

I left that day giving Heath the information he needed to draft the documents. Since I didn't live nearby, he emailed me drafts of the documents when they were complete for me to review. I was able to ask any questions I had before hand and when I showed up to pick up the documents, all I had to do was sign and pay the small fee that was charged. Witnesses were available and everything was painless. 

I highly recommend visiting Heath for any estate planning needs."

BfY2GyG8U7QviV2ZH4u2DQ,1,"We bought a brand new Mini Countryman from Toronto Mini Downtown about 17 months ago and had 15588 kms on it . Had two tires have issue already. 
First time was a bubble on front passenger tire's side wall. They wouldn't want to cover it under warranty even it's a defect. We end up paid $358.12 to get a tire and installed by them.
The second time was happened few days ago. The front driver side tire blew out from the side wall and almost caught an accident on highway 404. There was nothing on the highway can cause a damage on the side wall of tire. When we tolled our mini to Mini Downtown, they refused to warranty the defect tire again. This time, we paid $362.91 to change the tire.
Two tires, both defect on the side wall and happened in one and half year. I am very disappoint of Mini's quality and service.  Will never purchase and recommend mini in my rest of my life. 
P.S. We are planning to sale our Mini Countryman now, since it's a very unsafe vehicle with 4 defect tires on it. Also we will file a claim on better business bureau at the mean time."
uhIlQiGnLO_-PfH_8nZ8vQ,4,"New and...I liked it! It's located on the second floor of the Ivy, just across the street from the Blumenthal Theater. If you come in from Tryon, you'll walk up a narrow stairwell and come in facing the bar. If you come in from the main Ivy's building, I am pretty sure you can find an elevator to get in. 

The service was very friendly and attentive. There is plenty of seating and I've got to say, if you are into people watching, this is a nice set up. The decor is classy and room for lots of people. Sitting on the second floor, windows line the dining area. 

We ordered the veggie lo mein and the General Tso's chicken. They came out promptly and fresh. Both portions were large and really enough to share if you weren't hungry for your own plate. 

Try it next time you are in Uptown. Most of the dishes for dinner are just under $10. Their menu also states that they can deliver."

I will be calling manager and update Yelp post upon his response. I have never had such poor customer service. They just ruined a $600 phone.

Keep in mind this is my first time coming here and they're getting their information from what I thought was confidential patient information. I did notate hair loss, to simplify my symptoms on paper. The front desk attendant diagnosed me with alopecia while I'm still in the waiting room with multiple patients who could hear our conversation. They told me my office visit would be $160. At this point I'm embarrassed. ""Well is there anything else you have,because hair loss just won't be covered"" I said no it's a little different I don't know if it's alopecia. Front desk's reply was ""Well there's different types."" And that was that. I could not believe we were having this conversation in the waiting room.

3Ul4BrRVGarGsf0tWXkMFA,5,"This place is nothing more than a dream come true for fans of well cooked meats and foie gras!  Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.

The food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.

I sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.

After a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.

The main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.

Dessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.

The star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.

However, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!"

Thankfully we caught our termite's early so treatment was not too intense but even so, I'd call them. Everyone I interacted with there was super friendly and helpful. They do not use carcinogens to treat which is nice (last thing we need in our house is a nerve agent!) and I'm sure my dogs will appreciate that too. Our appointment was at 9am, but our helper actually showed up earlier than that--about 20 minutes early, armed with a spec sheet and ready to get the work. He had to pull the carpet up to drill, but you'd never know that looking at it now. He pointed out the cause of why the termites may have come out, a leak on the side of the house we will have treated. Costs were not very heavy at all and great professional service, I highly recommend!"

The croissants tasted like tulicreme, the deserts were mushed up in the box by the lady who took our order and the taste was far from familiar. I am sorry but I wouldn't return. Wish they will hire a better Baker"

cIeF6K2kjNNkJ2pMKrGztA,2,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)"

rtle3DSQRWUr38t_gumKHQ,5,Always a great place for a night on the town!  I love sitting in the bar area to people watch and enjoy live music.  The food is delicious and the drinks are perfect.  We love to come for a romantic evening or a fun night with friends.  I love the upscale casual feeling coupled with a high quality menu.  And the service is attentive and prompt and we always leave looking forward to our next evening at Ocean Prime!  We are big fans!
bveIxS-cg5aeqNvth_KPag,4,"My first stay in a casino was here a couple weeks ago for a few days.  Not a bad place.  The room was nice, not expensive, and the staff was friendly.  I didn't do a whole lot in the Casino itself because I was attending an event, but the family seemed to enjoy themselves with bowling, arcades, and eating.  

We did play a few slot machines before we left.  I like the penny slot machines, when I win five bucks, they make a whole lot of noise.      

About the only negative I can give is the buffet, it was edible, but not all that good."

L_TtjgMr127RWqb4PjRZgA,5,"We dined at this restaurant whilst visiting Vegas 2 weeks ago and had a great time. The lady who seated us was hard to understand but once our waiter (Mike) took over, things improved greatly. As we had 2 young children who get restless quickly, he was accommodating with bringing out their drinks and meals quickly. When I asked him, what felt like a millions questions, he was awesome with answering them for me. The food was magnificent, cheap cocktails that left a smile on our faces and would have easily had a few more, but had to drive :( 
The atmosphere was like I had never experienced before, the thunder storm was also pretty cool!! 
Would definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to returning when in Vegas again!"

Their chicken are also top notch the flavors were so infused into the chicken, everybite is seasoned well. I would definitely go back over and over again."

f1zwyZ0tCPvovQ00w8MjmQ,3,"This weekend I wanted to get my dog bathed, nail trimmed, etc. I called a couple places and they were all booked. I called Pawsh Wash and they said they could take her if we could come in then. So I brought my dog in. While I was filling out the paper with my contact info. the groomer came to the other side of the counter and loved on my dog to gain her trust and then took her on the other side of the counter and let her off the leash. She said it would be 2 to 3 hours and that they close by 4. We left and ran some errands. As we were headed home we noticed it was close to 3:30 and so I called to check on her as it had been 3 hours. I was told she would be ready in 20 minutes. We were about 20 minutes away so we headed that direction. We arrived exactly 20 minutes later. I walked in, and this is the only reason they got 3 stars instead of four, the groomer told me I was rushing her and that they usually call when she would be done. I explained that I had called because she told me they closed at 4 and wanted to make sure I picked her up before then. She said okay and that was that. My dog is a lab so she does not get groomed, but the bath and nail trim etc. were very good. I would probably try this place again, because they did a good job. I just hope I don't have to deal with being told I am rushing them again when I called, and they told me to come get her in 20 minutes which I did."

y1lPMc3JDbo6HAU_aToQdw,2,"First thing to know, gratuity is added to your bill, so the incentive for good service is out the door. Don't mind paying over priced food if it's good and the service is on par. Has to ask 3 times for a high chair, each time she said, but she went to sit more guests or rearranging the menus, finally had to find one myself. I asked our waitress for an empty bowl so I can feed my baby, 10 minutes later, a good runner in black (black lady) brought one, I politely asked her for another, she looked at me with a blank expression, clean two tables behind us, and refilled water for other tables except us, still no bowl. Since the last in black ignored us, we asked the lady in Orange for a bowl, she gave my wife the hand, and walked away. Apparently, she's the Keno lady, but she could have said ""let me get you your server"". Don't even get me started with the $18th bowl of bland pho and tasteless cornish hen chicken."

We had just gotten to the point of ""I'm so hungry I don't even know what I want anymore"" when we decided to stop in. I am so glad we did!! The brisket did not disappoint! Ours was served wet, I felt totally indulgent eating the fat on the meat, but it was too good. The Cole slaw is awesome and the BBQ sauce, served on the side, was incredible! We ordered the sweet potatoes fries to share and the maple aioli they come with is seriously insane! We left with our bellies brimming with fullness and a new favorite haunt to add to the weekly rotation. Definitely check this place out!!"

(you can see the pic from that day before in my post above) The  person who did my nails was the manager, Evan and I don't think he put enough sealant.  It's hit the 1 week mark now and will be bringing this up to their attention Friday because I live with someone who comes to them for regular gel,  and hers never chip or destroy her nails like this!  My nails had grown out pretty well and now my nails are nubs! Con was my toes of the same style pedi survived the two weeks."
p9xEcIv4eU9eLIUuIEmn5g,3,"Good drinking bar for those who like good drinking bars. Dark, more dark and darker still, its interior is either straight from the 1970s - I described in as ""the sort of bar one could see in the show 'Charlie's Angels' during the Farrah Fawcett era"" - or constructed to look like such. Either way, it's a huff of smokey air in the pre-fab, ""let's have consumer-driven fun"" world of Las Vegas. The enclosed, circular fireplace in the center of the first room is a nice touch and, along with the votive candles on the tables, a good source of light. If you're anti-hipster (whether patron or staff), this probably isn't the place for you, since a chunk of the crowd and the workers are dressed in dark clothing and sneaker-shod, have varying degrees of body art, slouch, smoke and possess a disaffected stare. Like Don't Tell Mama, this place is much easier to access if you start early (around 8 or 9 p.m.), especially on the weekend. While there are available street spots in this part of downtown, many of the reviews mention using a pay lot; this wasn't an issue for us, as we were staying at the El Cortez, just down the street and the hotel had ample parking in its structure. Please note that there was a supposed credit card minimum when we were in on Saturday, 5/19/12, which was $15, so my friend bought a shot. The crowd seemed neither friendly nor unfriendly and the noise level was low enough to accommodate conversation (again, remember we were here between 9 and 10 p.m. on a Saturday). Good jukebox with indie stuff - big surprise! - and no cover make this a no-brainer, especially for someone who opts for a downtown hotel stay instead of the strip. Remember to venture past the first room, especially if the bar is crowded, because this seems to be where the action is on busy nights."
xCCuOL5kbtQq7T-DOXF8rA,5,"My family has been shopping at this Smith's for nearly 18 years. It is consistently one of the best supermarkets I have been in.

 It is not TJ's or Whole foods ( but those are different beasts all together!)

Perhaps it is the large size with the spacious isles that has me smitten with this place but they also have a really large selection of your typical Supermarket items.

Good Deli, Great selection of most every product. Their produce and vegetables are actually pretty good as well!

I feel this is almost like a costco as you can buy a lot of things in bulk here.

Help is really awesome as well.

Parking is great.....sorry I'm from San Francisco and parking is a blood sport."
NBW2zKP2E-ymUu5foWEDOA,4,"Wow, I can't believe there's only a few reviews of this company.   I met a SunRun sales rep in Costco one day.  I asked him some technical questions with no intent to purchase a system.  A follow up meeting at my house by one of the sales team answered my remaining questions.  It seemed almost too good so I told them I would think about it.  I called some of the other solar installers in Las Vegas and told them the deal.   They told me that they couldn't even come close and would not return my calls for a formal quote.  Yes, that is absolutely true!

We opted to buy out the lease outright which gives us a solar system for 20 years with free maintenance and support the whole time.  The equipment is theirs but I think it's much like a cell phone.  You'll want to upgrade before the end of 20 years anyways.  I calculate my cost to be 8.55 cents per kw/hr compared to that of 13.1 cents per kw/hr of NV Energy.  We only get a $14 bill from the power company now; which is well worth it for the net metering service they provide (which means every ounce of unused solar power produced by the system can be sent to the grid for later use) .  No other costs as everything for the next 20 years was paid upfront.    

I know they are new in town and they wanted to make a good impression with the new trucks and equipment, but they followed through with installers that were exceptionally professional.  They kept me informed during every part of the installation.   They installed the system in only a few days and I was very happy with the end result; both with the solar panel placement on the roof and the inverter placement inside the garage (my preference).

Because I signed up when they were at Costco, we received coupons for free Costco membership renewal and a $500 Costco card.   It takes a while to get both, but they came without me asking for them.

I just couldn't be happier and I don't normally write reviews.  I do, however, use Yelp a lot to decide on services for the house, so I just thought I would take a few minutes and contribute.  I would do this again with SunRun ""in a minute"".  Take a bow SunRun."

I'm going back again today for botox.   Can't beat the price."
SIEpzEMezFA9dyNFTUaiDA,4,"Best item I had that I would go back again for:  shoe-string fries

Items ordered:

- Potato Twisters:  It was fun to see a huge pile of carby-goodness.  A bit of a smokey taste.  If you like a softer version of kettle chips, this one is for you. 

- Southwest Chicken Salad:  Nothing spectacular.  The lettuce which composed most of the salad was a bit bitter.  It would've been better if more of the ""other"" items listed on the menu were present.

- Mini burger sampler:  
The turkey burger was tastiest of all 3 (IMO).
Beef burger was standard for a sit down restaurant.  
Ahi burger didn't have enough ahi.  It was two thin slices.  So, you were biting mostly into bread.  

- Captain Hook Burger (Fried Cod):  The crust was very salty, but the crispiness of the fish was excellent. I didn't care for the sweet relish.

- Iced Tea:  perfect.... freshly brewed 


Service:  very slow (They need to hire a runner to deliver the food to the tables... especially since they sold over 1000 GroupOn deals.)

Price:  Pricier than Smash Burger for about the same quality just nicer ambiance

Ambiance:  A fun place to go on a casual date.  Cute decor (contemporary cowboy?)  The booths are great for really tall people.  For short people like me, it felt like I saw sinking in the seat and had to sit up to reach the table.   

I would only go back for the turkey burger & the shoe string fries, but I'd have to get some kind of deal because their prices are just more than many of the other restaurants around town."
qXAnwTqZdIOyJ2HGUTRXRw,3,"I haven't been to a Red Robin since living in Anchorage. That was over twenty years ago; I was rather young. While I didn't remember the flavors, I did remember my experience fondly. This goes to show that memories as a child can be skewed somewhat. The interior decor is an over-the-top tchotchky reminiscent of a restaurant one might find at a theme park, i.e. Disney World.  On the meal for this visit:

Clam chowder
Prime Rib Sandwich
French Onion Soup
Chicken Pesto Pasta

I am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal. 

I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer. Stouffers makes a better chicken pesto pasta at a much lower price. There are just too many other better restaurants in the area to consider returning."

So I said if you don't wanna do it I am fine to have someone else. Then she didn't say anything. During the massage, all I got is keep scratch my skin. So I asked can you pressed it instead of keep scratching my skin cuz it hurt. Then she start pressing my feet but the pressure is too light that all I feel is she touched me. So I asked can you please use more pressure, then she said her thumb hurts and can't use that much of pressure. She also said I can't even do one customer a day it's too tired.

Service was prompt and attentive, the salmon salad was fresh, tasty and a generous portion. Lot of space to spread out with an area, much like a back yard for the kids, both young and old, to stretch out.

GAnX0-3-4n9FFGj59_nxpg,1,Purchased over $62 worth of stuff from your store. Got home and couldn't find 2 items that were paid for. Decided to come back to the store and get it. They had to check the camera to see if it went into the bag. I told them we didn't get the stupid item. I have to pay for it again when we clearly didn't get the item. I live on the north side of town. I can get it at any store. Why would I drive all the way to your store just to lie that I didn't get the item? It might cost a small amount of money but the point is why would I have to pay for something that I already paid for and not get. If I wanted to steal any of your merchandise....it wouldn't be for pennies. You just lost me as a customer.

hrGgc8QPFJx8r4LmitrgqA,1,"Dear Jessica

I am so glad that you have responded to this serious concern.  I am 100% in agreement with you that this criminal, damaging, abusing and neglecting behavior from your staff and your director is not a reflection of Kindercare standards. Actually is not a reflection or should be the norm to any place where the safety of a child should be #1 priority

We have taken this to a higher power and the law. We have parents and a numerous amount of teachers that are leaving your center as I type this document, ready to testify. 

Go ahead and try to delete every comment I make. I have saved all correspondence and your director needs to stop pretending to pose as a parent. We saved her Yelp comment and it will be subpoena that she posed as a parent to validate a crime based on pay

The claims cannot be unsubstantiated just based on your statements. I do not need to get contacted by the leadership team, since Erika didn't seem to care for four days to call me back. Darby did not ever call me once after these horrendous incidents happened to my child, and at this point this has been taken into a legal level. I am concerned about what your staff is saying to you, and you may have the best intention as the franchise owner. However, I have several parents with similar situations that are pulling their kids out, and now we are going into a CIVIL CLASS AUCTION. I suggest that you consult with you attorney before you continue to respond. Anything that we say can be used in the court of law. The reality is that you also have a huge turnover of teachers that are leaving as I type this message. Many of them ready to testify and see how ""unsubstantiated these claims truly are"". They will not only back every single claim from every single parent from this forum, but they will speak their truth. 
It is time that the abuse and discrimination comes to an end. Also, notify your center director that before she decides to create a fake yelp account (response that was taken down right after, but I saved). That all IP addresses and posts can be subpoena in any forum to see where the note was originally posted from. I am not sure if your parents have access to the computers at your kinder care to create responses on Yelp, but it would be interesting to see why someone created a fake ID and decided to response posing as a parent. 
Please install cameras in your center with audio. I suggest that you start spending some funds and allocating safety precautions into the safety of the children as you state, not just with words, but with actions. You may be shocked with the abuse that is happening at your center without your knowledge. I will be contacting Kinder-care through all the parents legal counsel from this point forward and I do not need any of this rehearsed non sense to appeased people, cover the crimes and meet affiliated standards. There are things that have happened that can be proven and you cannot take away or hide. 

Today 05/24/2017 you sent this same response to me via Facebook through your page. We received a numerous amounts of emails and direct messages from that response of yours THANK YOU!

We have now more teachers and parents that are advocates to child safety and we hope that for the sake of the kids you look into these serious claims and allegations. 

- The teachers are being disrespected and fired on the spot by lies and the abusers are allowed to care for children. 

- I have teachers with proof ready to submit the above claims and support the yelling, ear pulling, insulting and child abuse that is happening in your center

- Parents and teachers have witness Darby showing up drunk from the night before. How do you expect an alcoholic to care about child's safety?

Please spend some money in cameras with audio to make sure you get your story straight and see what's truly happening behind your bank"

Just sayin. haha    I def. recommend JB if you're looking to be entertained by something other than a cirque, magic or boobie show.   

Tickets:  We ended up just purchasing our tix from the Paris desk since we were staying at the Paris.  Too lazy to go to discount tix or look for cheaper ones.  We got the cheapest tickets which were around 60 bucks.  FYI:  I heard the couple next to us ask if they had senior citizen discounts and they were hooked up.  Score!

Venue:  Any seat is good since it's not a huge venue.  There aren't any funky columns or obstructions anywhere so no chance of having to watch with your neck turned at a 90 deg angle.  We were sitting the 3rd or 4th row from the back and it was fine.  So unless you feel the need to be up close and personal you're fine getting the cheap seats.

Show:   I know I'm getting older when I want to hear music my 63 and 65 year old parents listen to!  Hubs and I were like one of the youngest couples there (in our 30s) but age is nothing but a numba here.  I won't go into details since you should see it for yourself but I will be honest, the beginning is kinda boring.  I remember whispering to the hubs it better pick up or I was ready to take a nappy nap.  But after 15-20 minutes it picks up.  JB is all about how Frankie became Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons via acting, dancing, and great singing.  I was actually surprised by how many of their hits I knew! So sit back, relax, and enjoy! 

FYI: Like Rodney S. mentioned, prob not the best show to bring kids to since there is some profanity and gun action going on.....Joyzy to the max!"
6DaET2ScrNL2GbL8OUvI3A,1,"Not recommended. They came out to service our 6 AC units while we were gone for the summer. They left our cooling on 70* (in the middle of the summer!) when we had it set to 90* while we were gone. Our electric bill was  4Xs as much as when it was left on 90*. We didn't know until when received our electric bill. Total waste of money!

When we returned to the home, several of the units made strange noises. When we reached out - they were only concerned with having us buy an annual contract and no concern to hear why we wanted them out. 

Our experience with them was not good."
DDg9WoXSwHN7ydbAN67ojA,4,Good burger if you need something quick. Great prices! Service is always great. Everyone that works there is always so nice. Burgers are a little on the small side compared to other places but tasty. I am from Texas so my heart will always belong to Whataburger when it comes to fast food burgers like this.
JAjjVCcYcUVZG8-5cS49GA,2,This was a typical mall foodcourt crap place. The two combo plates for $9.95 each was a waiste of money. The schwarma was dry and pulled out of a holding bin and thown on flat top to heat through. The combo plate had chicken and kefta kabob both dry burned on the ends and again pulled from a holding bin. The hummus was tastelss. This place has no redeamimg qualities even for a mall food court. Yuck
Jd-I9uVATmNJ_64FwPjTmA,4,I love 131 Main!!!! Grilled trout! Wild rice salad! Banana cream pie! Good wine & main salad! All Awesome! But maybe that's because I drank the bottle of wine! Anyway...I'll be back!
wU-_oMXG72YniXTWv3Ip_A,5,Great service and the fish is super fresh.   Only ten seats per seating service so book ahead.  Get seats close to the owner/chef to see how it's done!
sLnF_FhJrdT-RmXnY8M4pg,4,"Stopped on a late Saturday morning to find the place void of any customers. A little skeptical we went in because our only other option for donuts was the QT across the street.

Was greeted by a woman who asked if we wanted a dozen. We opted for a half dozen. $6.91 was our total. The maple bacon donut was extremely fresh. Wonderful, the maple glaze was sweet but the bacon salty. Perfection. Apple fritter crunchy on the outside soft and gooey on the inside. My son really liked his chocolate long john.

All of our donuts were fresh and tasty except the raised pink frosted sprinkle. We think it was a day old. The customer service could have been a little friendlier but overall was a good donut experience and we will return."
ck-IeBLudXTqUjhkbEUYEQ,4,"Hyper hubris that has plenty of luxury and lounging space without the gambling clamor always in your face. ""Cosmopolitan"" has stayed faithful to its own name, in that respect. We're still far off from a fortress of solitude, not unless you stay in one of their decadently plum rooms. But in off-season, this is the place I'd like to return to. Without the horde of people, this is cosmo-ritzy. #historymaking"
vsvznnHNerpP4ER7tjcxRg,5,"I had a very good experience! I sent a vague email describing the type of pavers I wanted over to them and they were very prompt in their response. They sent me all the different types of pavers that fit the specs I wanted and they were very affordable. I had several questions and they were very accommodating through email and responsive. I walked in and ordered in person just so that I could see the pavers before I ordered and they were delivered one week later to my driveway! Very easy, convenient, and helpful."
Nj8GrPxEbpPlozkPrff1-w,4,"First off, the manager/host was very friendly! I had called in to see if they were open on Family Day and he remembered me when we arrived!
(I just downloaded Yelp and this is my first review - I had to write down this experience somewhere) The wait for a table for two was almost instant. I got Eggs Benedict with salmon and asparagus while my partner got the Breakfast Feast.The portions of food were great for it's price and coffee had free refills! However, I must warn you: if you and your friends get home fries - it's A LOT. Next time, we'll substitute one of ours for tomatoes or something else.
Overall, it was a great brunch place just off the DVP. Would definitely recommend!"
m6rF9bATQlOegw6noSxUCg,4,"First time at Carly's Sunday afternoon after visiting Radish at the Desoto Market!

After enjoying a $7 IPA and a $10 cocktail at Desoto... we decided we wanted a decently priced Bloody Mary. So, my roommate suggested Carly's. I guess they used to have $4 BM's on Sunday's? But that has changed to $6 now when you buy 2. Not bad since they add lots of garnish (if you're a veg head, make sure to ask for no meat or cheese). 

We also ordered the hummus trio which came with red pepper & regular hummus & this olive Tapenade (which is to die for!) served w/grilled flat bread & terra chips for $8.

Next, we ordered a Beermosa to share with a shot of Bourbon (for an extra $2)! I definitely recommend it! Super strong and worth the $$! 

Needless to say, after that trip to Carly's I left with a full tummy and had a good buzz going on! I can definitely see myself coming back for some drinks and their vegetarian options!"
jq2rFlHYun19hy_xWfwzpQ,5,"I have become addicted to FM.  Yes, the location is truly terrible and the parking lot small.  However, once inside the store you're treated to a peaceful, clean, organic shopping experience where you can trust the food you're buying is excellent quality.  The fruit and veggie selection isn't as large as what Whole Foods offers, but what they have is ripe, ready to eat, and at a good price.  I most often find myself in FM for the bakery.  I buy a lot of their fresh breads, pies, cookies, muffins, and donuts.  Why?  Because they're absolutely delicious and not loaded with fillers and chemicals.  My family can enjoy the occasional treats and I don't have to spend hours in the kitchen baking.  The fresh meats are excellent.  The salads and sides are excellent, the take-home pizzas are winners.  This is a really nice store and very different from Giant Eagle.  The quality of GE's selection doesn't compare to FM, and the stress level in GE is almost the same as shopping in Wal-mart.  My experience is in FM is always stress-free and the other customers are friendly.  I cannot speak to the selection of gluten-free or allergen-free items at FM because we do not have these issues in our home, but generally speaking for families without food allergies, I highly recommend this store."
ydCADnLbRYPSgokD5LhP-g,3,"I met the hubs for lunch yesterday on the recommendation of a coworker ,who said they were great AND affordable.  Turns out she was spot on.  We were seated immediately (lunch hour was just hiding its stride) and our waitress was at our table within minutes.  I decided on the Grilled Chicken salad with Walnuts and the man ordered a spicy pasta dish.  Our food was out super fast! I thoroughly enjoyed my salad and can vouch that the pasta dish was just as tasty.  Our lunch meal only came to $20 and some change.  Looks my husband and I will have to trade in our local Applebee's lunch date for Cheddars!"
HHcWQit13QuQfyGeMJQaUg,3,"Okay local bar. Short on craft beers, but the service at the stick is okay. I ordered the cheeseburger sliders - they were overcooked and way too salty. Ate one and was done. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again if I'm in the area (HGI is right next door) but wouldn't go out of my way to eat or drink here."
rz2lhtJtwFvWcZt7MiNLnQ,1,Doesn't matter if you book a non smoking room.. All of them are smoking obviously. Online they said there was a free breakfast but there is only coffee. Don't go here! It's gross in every way and I regret spending $50 on it.
KPdDs_6cSlc8jXDJ7dUdmQ,4,"We tried their signature Blu Burger and a build your own with the Kobe beef. They were both great and very large. We tried regular fries, zucchini fries and onion rings. The zucchini fries were awesome! The only bummer was there weren't very many. The sides are definitely not for sharing. Another con is that they actually have a split plate charge of $2. That really bothered me. Overall, great service and good food! Next time I am trying a $3.50 milkshake."
_II1hdhYvO1l48IsrS3Atw,5,"Amazing food!!!! the kitchen is open and you see the cooks working hard! The place gets packed quick and the food is really cheap. The staff is always super nice and welcoming. Really good place and is a must try! 
During summer,i love to sit on their huge terrasse which faces marche jean-talon! Very good vibe."
8cR_ffWKya_qnqX_du9OBQ,4,"Went to Golden Corral tonight at the recently opened location in Las Vegas.  I had never been to a Golden Corral before and didn't know what to expect, although I had done some research before hand.

My wife and I wanted lunch as to avoid what we figured would be a large dinner crowd, so we arrived about 2:30.  It was quite busy, with a line at the cashier stand, however the line moved quickly.  The major bottleneck is the beverage station, it slows forward progress as diners fill their glasses.  As long as you're going to have servers that re-fill your drinks, you might as well have them serve the initial drink to avoid the delay at the front door.  

The price was good, I'm used to two-for-one deals at the casino buffets, so it was weird paying for both lunches, but the pricing was reasonable.

We were able to find a table with no difficulty, as it was seat yourself at that time.  The restaurant was clean, and tables were bussed frequently, with no piles of dirty plates or napkins cluttering the tables.  

The food was very good, some items were a little bland for my taste, such as the mexican dishes weren't as spicy as I would have liked.  The meatloaf was a hit for me and my wife, which we consider the best meatloaf of any buffet.  The steakburger sliders were very good too.  

We were very pleased with how often the food is rotated, I didn't see any old or dried out food on the buffet line.  We had to be careful when eating because the food was very hot, which is a plus!  I also like how you can watch the food preparation as you're eating.  It's nice to watch them cooking as your eating so you know the food is being handled well, and prepared fresh.

The desert area was very good as well.  Although it's hard to get to the fountains because of the volume of people trying to use them, it's almost always wall-to-wall people at the desert counter.  I can highly recommend the hand scooped ice cream too.

Lastly, everyone, even the other diners, were very friendly.  Everyone was observing proper line etiquette, and excusing themselves.  Not jumping in line, waiting patiently.  Such a nice change from buffets where the norm is the ""entitled"" elite who think they run the world and you must allow them to cut in front of you and in general ignore you.  It's nice to be seen and to be acknowledged and to use the people skills our parents taught us.  Oh, and there were a lot of servers, buss persons, and staff keeping everything running very smoothly.

As long as things stay the same at this location I'm quite sure it'll remain our favorite buffet in Las Vegas."
kvFUDP6wkDJHg0R3gOyt-w,3,"Food here is decent. Prices are okay as well. The owner, she's very nice and attentive. The service, on the other hand, is a joke. First server didn't know what room temperature water was. Second server we asked forgot. Also the hot pot we ordered came out without the fire underneath lit. If my wife didn't love hot pot so much i would've never gone there. She will probably still go but tonight was the last time for me."
iKTY2Jbyw5ADMRy8m1i1-w,5,We love Lanny and Kim for pedicures. My hubby says they're the best!  Always on time and they take their time.

water glass was very well used, hard to tell if it was clean or not and some of the other parts of the restaurant a little ""well used""."
1Sbei4KpHQhBrIRlh1GcFw,4,Dinner is much better than lunch fish is fresher.  Service was great on both good place.

dtevjkPZHLddthVlAtPqnA,3,"House pan roast was pretty damn good, but the seating and cleanup is in turtle speed.  Waitress disappears and leaves the last parties dishes sitting there for about 15 min while we stand in line starving...who manages this place? Nothing bad can be said about the chef cuz he is working his ass off.  30 min wait is cool but I wouldn't do an hr."

2qs6smL93-vZy76GsVKEEw,4,"It's a beautiful, peaceful campus. You see first his childhood home on the left. Flower beds line the trails. The scent of flowers and the soft sounds of hymns guide you to the barn.

And then -- a talking cow with a ""mammy"" accent tells about the childhood of ""Billy Frank.""

Stop. 

This is ridiculous. A preacher of the gospel you want to introduce by a talking cow with a ""mammy"" accent? Who thought this up?

And then you sit as a group and watch a movie. Then you are taken to the next room as a group and watch a movie. Then you are taken to the next room as a group and watch a movie.Then you are taken to the next room as a group and watch a movie.Then you are taken to the next room as a group and watch a movie.Then you are taken to the next room as a group and watch a movie.

My advice: put the cow in a corner and have it an optional intro for very small children.

Have one introductory video. Then let people go. Let them have optional videos like in any other museum. Let people just browse and look at the artifacts.

And the ""Billy Graham Library""? It's behind glass way up above you preserved as a decoration. I'd rather like to at least be able to read the spines to see what books he read.

Yes, Billy Graham was a great evangelist. I saw him in Boston in 1982. I saw him on TV for many years. Give them samples in different rooms on different themes. But don't spoon feed it to a captive audience that must sit through movie after movie after movie after movie after movie."
uzuJPQ4YtpIEHiBMdlnNsg,5,"OMG...love this place...something for all my kids...we love the prices and the portions..food is great...great staff, great location Vegas hot spot!!"
4IQJTszUOBwOeuctwkYARA,4,Great place to stop for the night or stay a while.  We stopped for the night after a long day of traveling and the water park was just what the kids needed to burn off some energy.  I definitely recommend it. The place was nice and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.
XQeeg7WFkHVnQX2XuEqlbA,4,"It was really good! My friend and I came here pretty early, so it wasn't very crowded. I'm a vegan, and they basically didn't have anything for me on the menu, but very graciously made me something special. I don't recall exactly what, but it was some kind of salad (that I enjoyed even though I wouldn't normally order salad) and an asparagus/fiddlehead dish. Super nice staff."
6taCleGgjdVL6b-Q6kCNGw,5,"A few people have told me that La Paz just isn't the same since their move. Back in the day, they were a frequent lunch place of mine when they were on South Blvd.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but went with an open mind.

On my first visit I had the fish tacos - well one fish and one shrimp.  They were very accommodating in allowing me to try one of each.  They were good.  I would order them again.

The five stars come from my second visit.  I had the shrimp and steak salad.  They cook the steak perfectly to medium, as requested and the salad is simply phenomenal!   Their sun-dried tomato vinaigrette is delicious and was the perfect match.  If you have to eat a healthy salad, this is the one to pick.  The meat is spicy, tender and char-grilled.  

If you go to La Paz with expectations of their former self you might be disappointed.  I think they did a great job.  New look, new menu....just the name remains.  Plus, their house wine is one of my favorites.  How can that be bad?"
muKw9xnXTWVM0MzSIBm5HQ,5,"We were referred by a friend and the service was friendly, fast, and efficient.  They did not try to take advantage of us - totally straight up.  We felt that we paid a fair price for all of the work we had done.

D1y935SY3KRjDE_K9-jeWg,5,"When you go into this sweet little family owned eatery you will not leave disappointed or hungry in any way.  The food is incredibly fresh, delicious, and exactly what we were looking for.  On top of all that the owners and staff are truly something special.  So kind, informative, and accommodating.  Our drinks never got below half which is so appreciated on a 112 degree day.  When they heard we just arrived in town the owner Paul sat down with us and wrote a two page itinerary of other eatries and indoor fun for our nine year old.  Our amazing server Nick even asked if we wanted our drinks to go.  So gracious.  Thank you for your hospitality.  If you like Greek/Mediterranean food this is a must stop."

epn_hhEndrGlMyTD4vIeiw,5,"I just had what was possibly the most interesting burrito of my life (so far, anyway). Kimchi fried rice, tofu, carrots, lettuce, cheese, and Seoul sauce perfectly wrapped in a soft tortilla. Spicy, mouthwatering, deliciousness. The menu is limited so this is not a place I'll visit too frequently, but it's a big change from my normal culinary repertoire and an excellent choice for a quick bite - certainly more interesting than many a meal I've had in CU. Service was friendly and quick, and my burrito was well worth the $8 it cost. At nine months pregnant, I could hardly finish it (but I managed)."
wR3REK0P_vggyaOvCpYqNg,1,"I usually love this place but tonight the service was absolutely horrible!! First off they were out of kalbi and spam Musubi!! The excuse from hostess was it was a busy night. That's seriously not an excuse you should say to a paying customer. Then! It took forever to get my food- over 40min and 3 other parties received food before me. I ordered two meat plate of katsu and beef and then a plate of shrimp and thats it! One other dad and dtr left so upset because it took so long for their food to be served. I asked how much longer for my food the first time and she asked ""what'd your order again"" so I told her. No update. I asked 10 min later and she said ""what'd you order again"" seriously?!? I repeated my order and she said Oh here it is it just came out. It was my Katsu and beef and she said that's it. I said NO I'm still waiting for my shrimp. The cooks in back looked like they had no idea about it. And told me they were just waiting for my katsu to be done. I showed them the plate like It's right here..... .... suddenly they had a plate of shrimp there for who knows how long sitting there and said ""oh are you table 6??"" Like YES I am actually. What the hell is happening there?!? No idea what they're doing or how to respond to customers.


Only pro is that the food is still good. Too bad they don't even have it in stock ...

Just checked and my order is wrong .. it's chicken teriyaki instead of beef and they gave me salad instead of macaroni salad. Awesome....."
QEJf8c7lvyr7QDWtHNCx0w,5,Best place to get powder coat or wheel repair done. Not only is the quality amazing but the speed of which everything is done and the prices can't be beat. Everyone is professional and friendly and show great pride in their work! I would recommend them to everyone for any of your powder coat needs or wheel repair.
neu4EQS6XrnTARA3zsVQLQ,5,"Great market for Latinos trying to cook with great ingredients. I had to drive 40 minutes to stock up. The Taco stand outside is the best in the Cleveland area. The Taco de Pollo is hands down the best. Moist chicken with toppings of cilantro and onions and your choice of sauces. I love the avocado cream sauce. The woman before me said it bangs, and she was right!

The carne asada taco was very good. They cube it up pretty small which I don't prefer. But the flavor was very good. At $2.50 a taco, you can go wrong."
owQbATdtxhXEfvMQFgyXUQ,2,"Let me start out by saying I still have not eaten here... 

The pictures however are making me rethink my stance.  A couple years ago I was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that I brought along with me.  It clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time.  However, when we sat down and I tried to order the picture, I was told they don't prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day.  That I could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all.  Due to my prior excitement over the picture, and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen, but they would not use them the way they advertised, I was very deflated.  It ruined my appetite, we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since.  

I am glad to see so many positive reviews, hopefully I will move past my grudge soon and finally try the food that aesthetically appealed to me before."

euMaxEDZweuGCEGqfAr64g,5,Just wanna give a shout out to an employee by the name of Saul. Hes very sweet and is generous when it comes to making my salad that I always get. I love the veggies and sauce...I always give a tip just so they remember me for next time hoping they'll maybe be a Lil more generous when it comes to portion sizes..but this time I couldnt since I didnt have no cash ...I would personally give Saul a tip just for how nice he is ! But Anyways tho this location is the best !  Everyone is awesome .
MVMJidWp5hzVxkAqUDN3fw,4,"I came here en route to Chicago. Impressed by the menu & enticed by the Lao menu. Of course, for whatever reason , Lao dishes are always way more than their Thai counterparts despite widely same spices. I digress, food...
Thai tea-awesome one of the best I've had, no skimping on the size, 1/2&1/2, sugar or flavor. Excellent!!
Gai mok- very excited as I've only had the fish ""version"" which is amazing. It wasn't steamed long enough and the middle was cold. It was ok, but overall wouldn't get it again. The cold part just turned me off. 
Laab gai Lao style- was kinda sad they couldn't prepare it as a cold salad (which is how my nephew's Laotian family serves it and how I had it in Thailand) but they tried their best to accommodate although when I asked them to put it in the fridge after prep as it would be take out, I don't think they understood as the waitress said they don't have a fridge. 
Gai yang (bbq chicken) with papaya salad and sticky rice- outstanding, the chicken was boneless breast, well marinated, delicious, the sticky rice perfect along with a side of papaya salad, pefect, just like you would get in Thailand. Outstanding. Even the table next to me asked what I ordered and commented it looked very good. It was so good, I wanted to share it with him...then I thought that would be weird, so I didn't offer."

The Homewood location is one of the BEST pizza places I've been to.  I am a bit bias as I have been coming here since I was a child.  The new Craig location in Vegas is great... it's larger than the previous location.  I recommend the antipasto salad and any thick crust pizza.  The Aurelio's Pizza Sauce makes the pizza great, not matter what location you visit.  The service is awesome!

VX6k6HWusJ_iozwry7AGEA,5,"This restaurant redeemed itself with the assistance of the manager. She took ownership of the bad experience we had, gave us a gift card and asked us to return and promised a better meal.  We went back today and she held up her end of the bargain. She remembered who we were, brought us free pancakes without asking and gave us great service.

There is a perfect blend of songs in their sets and I always enjoy watching them.  If you want to go on an awesome classical rock journey, check them out, you won't be dissapointed."

Judy showed up RIGHT ON TIME and was a very trustworthy  and pleasant person. She worked her butt off for me!!!!! I probably should have booked 4 hours for my 2 masterbd/2 1/2 bath, 1000 sqft condo but I only did three. There were a few things she did not have time for (blinds, fans, dusting higher srfaces, and stairs) but thats not because she was not trying. Judy was MOVIN!

It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and ""wa la""..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And ""BAM"" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review. 

We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.

My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The ""corn cakes"" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?

I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous!

I had the citrus salmon and my boyfriend had the filet.  We had calimari to start and the chocolate cake to finish.  All was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Highly recommend this place!"
xu39VZ9oPzknOSwQEsZUWQ,2,"As an update, I can't even count on the coffee being consistently good. A few in our party had bitter and just dirty tasting java. We brought it back and the girl said that sometimes happens. What? They then cleaned the machine. I think they just need to be diligent about cleaning the machine and the spout should be wiped every time. Please don't rest on it being the only java shop in the hood. Let's serve everyone like you want them to come back. We don't want to lose you yet. :)"
kWnwwZX54GG2iL5MG7R73w,5,"Spectacular. Huge and beguiling menu. Avoid the Americanized stuff and get some of the authentic dishes. We started with the chive dumplings and cold and spicy noodles before moving on to the beef with eggplant, shrimp dumpling soup with noodles, and pea greens with garlic. Each dish had sophisticated layers of flavor that really impressed us. Service is very fast - maybe too fast for some. This is not a white tablecloth place, but what's coming out of the kitchen would not be out of place at an incredibly pricey restaurant. Even after overeating, we had enough to feed four people with our leftovers the next day. So, six amazing meals for $50. Awesome. I'm really eager to go back."

My family and I stopped by to have lunch on April 15, 2017 . We orders the baby back ribs and mac n cheese and my favorite corn nuggets.
We received friendly and courteous service from Lizelle and Zack that day and by everyone else that works there.

I recommend the Rollin Smoke to anyone visiting Las Vegas."
iAqMMfVWWxLQp4d6G_4uyw,5,"Unfortunately no longer on Open Table ;( but still the best brunch in town in my book. And still always busy so clearly they don't need Open Table's help. Though to make a reservation you now actually have to speak into your smartphone (soon to be watch): 216-241-4243. 

I haven't written a review since the Brunch menu changed. My favourite Migas dish is no more, but it has been replaced by a new favourite - Shaksuka. Something that I've never heard of before, but have now had twice and love. It's so simple, yet so flavourful and always consistently good. 

The menu calls it spicy, but I'd disagree and just say well flavoured; it's not ""hot"" - maybe even a little sweet from the peppers and tomatoes. If you order it definitely add the lamb sausage. You get one links worth, about half the plate in size. It really makes the dish and adds substance to it - not optional in my opinion. 

Just like I was on the Migas I am hooked on this dish. Soon I will have to try something else as the rest of the weekend (still both Sat & Sund 1100-1500) brunch menu looks great! The sticky buns and apple butter sure are."

Dim Sum Restaurant has a good variety of dishes and service was fast, but it was way too expensive for the kind of quality you get.  Most of the dishes taste mediocre, some too oily, and whats worse is its mushiness.  My next stop is Dragon Court..."
Sm-ZqBGZZ63UKQ5C3z5baw,5,"I was recently in Arizona on vacation and needed an emergency appointment for severe tooth pain. Dr. Durisek not only saw me on short notice, but took me in on a holiday, took xrays, noticed an infected root that my home dentist missed, AND gave me a referral to an endodontist who took care of me. Amazing personal service, and caring staff. I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, professional dentist. Thank you, Dr. Durisek for taking the time to help me. I will be forever grateful!
Note: Dr. Durisek's waiting room has a massage chair, snacks, and Starbucks coffee that made the experience luxurious for my family! What a great place!"
-gn-URWUEfR-Lh8LmGYZgQ,4,My husband and I had guests from out of town and we brought them here for breakfast. The food is simply amazing. I've been to there other locations too but the one inside the Linq casino tasted a lot better. The chorizo with eggs and potatoes are sooooooo good!! If you are staying at the Linq you must check out this place! Its super good. We had reservations but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out. They were super busy so it wasn't an issue for us. The customer service was wonderful too. Make sure you come hungry because the portions are HUGE! =)

syaHJ_UcMaySdQvpwIEQOw,1,"Im going to start off with the food. I ordered the talapia topped with mango salsa with a side of steamed broccoli and ""country style green beans"". The tilapia was average and it came with baby grilled shrimp on top. The mango salsa was horrible. The mango didnt even taste like mango. The rice that it came over was definitely pre-packaged and gross. The green beans were CANNED. What kind of restaurant serves canned vegetables?!? The broccoli was steamed so you cant really mess that up too badly. They only have four draft beers, bud, bud light, miller light, and yuengling. YAWN! 
The service was not very good. Checked on me twice before my food even arrived, which was annoying, and never checked on me after i got my food until i was obviously finished. Just saw him standing next to the bar chit chatting with coworkers. He didnt even have the patience to wait til i left to take the checkbook. As soon as i closed it, he made sure to come right over to take it. I was there by myself so i wasnt trying to stay long at all. Didnt even get a thank you. Ungrateful jerk. 
All in all, im never going to Cheddars ever again and recommending people to never go there."

pAUvbiz23IxwM7CSxZFAQw,2,"I'm torn. The facility is clean and welcoming. The coaches are great, and the equipment is in great shape. But the turnover is ridiculous. In a few months, my daughter has had a revolving door of coaches. One week, there was no coach for 10 minutes, and then someone covered for a bit and then another coach took over. Today, one coach taught both preschool and the parent-tot class. So 8 kids used the equipment at the same time. Therefore, kids had to wait twice as long as normal to use the equipment. Patience is not the strong suit for most kids that age. Disappointed in the lack of continuity because there is no improvement without some level of consistency. Guessing they don't pay the staff enough to stick around which is a shame. I would pay a little more per month to help them retain quality coaches for longer periods of time.  Not sure if that's the issues, but it's a shame whatever the cause."

The gravy was good, the chicken fried steak had a nice crisp. I am not a fan of the home fries, it was mostly over cooked pieces of potato. Next time I won't get them crispy. There will be a next time. The water; I would recommend that they invest in a charcoal filter. I could taste nothing but chlorine. The coffee would also benefit, it was average at best. Admittedly I am a bit of a coffee snob.  For breakfast an outstanding restaurant. Four stars, fix the water."

kTn8F0ioNaS-6vxQxDENhg,1,"When we moved here last June, things were great for the most part.  The office staff was great, but we had a ton of things break in our apartment and there was only ONE maintenance guy that would spend hours if needed after others would say they had fixed it, but did not.  They just switched to a new management company and I cannot wait to leave. The gates are constantly broken now.  They used to break and would be fixed within 24 hours.  Last time, the gate by my apartment was broken for almost 3 weeks.  We are going on about 2 weeks, I think, on the front gate being broken now.  The maintenance people take forever to show up to fix anything.  Last time, it took them a week when it used to be 2 days at most.  And I recently spent the whole night in the hospital after my son had a nail go through his shoe and his foot on the property. This, after a nail went through my niece's shoe, luckily it went sideways and missed her foot.  When I went  into the office to let them know, they tried keeping the nail after I mentioned them having a possible lawsuit if it happened to us again or even someone else.  Then, I was told they would have me do an incident report which consisted of them taking down my name and apartment number.  No apologies, no compassion, NOTHING!!!!!!   They mentioned having maintenance come over and look through the rocks by my door, but of course, no one came.  I even told them they could come to my door and I would show them exactly where it went into my son's foot!!!!  They fired all maintenance and office staff when the new company took over which was a HUGE mistake.  The new office staff sucks and the new maintenance crew sucks.  I can't wait until my lease is up!!!!!!!  I would run the other way if you are thinking of moving here!!!"
Qh3TtzyJUTjnfKRnSTYD5w,1,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. I used to come here a bit but after the last couple times I've changed my mind. If you don't have certain cuts of chicken please don't lie to your customers and charge them extra!!! This happened too many times, just let the customer know and they'll be fine. Plus the customer service here went down hill almost instantly! Went to the drive through and I got stared down by some low life who worked there, I was so shocked to get this sort of treatment since I was paying quite a bit. I felt robbed, not gonna lie. I understand if the customer is being rude, I work in retail so believe me I've dealt with some assholes. This is why I try to be the best customer, but people like these guys are just useless and should be replaced with people who want to work. I'm done ranting but just to sum it up, don't waist your time because obviously you're waisting theirs."
Bi-f0y-ZNi_I-nfXrHretg,2,"Food was about a two. This place has become a bit rundown since the good old days. I ordered the ginger chicken with rice. It also came with a small salad and spring roll. Not bad for only $ 6.99. 

A friend ordered the cookie monster. It looked interesting! In the photograph it looked like it was served with a funnel cake. But when it arrived it was on a waffle. They could have told my friend they were out of funnel cakes that day. 

The thing I didn't like was, we had come in a group of 7. Service charge is automatically added for groups 6+ (10%), which was absolutely fine. Right before the bill was paid, our friend had asked if tips was included. To which the waitress had said yes. After the bill was paid, the waitress said the company takes the 10% and we need to add MORE for tips. The way that was handled and communicated could've been better. I did not want to leave anything at all after that. 

Never coming back. Lots of choices in the neighbourhood."

My husband got the tasting menu and it did not disappoint. A lot of variety and they happy switched out the scallops to which he's allergic to. I can't recommend Sushi Roku highly enough.

We like the customer service at this location and they never get our order wrong. The food is good (haven't tried the Taco Bell but the kfc is good). Everything is hot when we get it.the inside is clean. Well maintained. The only thing I wish they had was a baby changing station in the bathroom!
WuuFSocxG4-ICaY2kEegFw,5,"And here we go! I heard about this from a friend, and every time I pass this corner, I would always see a huge line so I knew it was inevitable that I was going to need to stop in and check out this new taco truck/ tent /outside restaurant venue. Let me just say, it did not disappoint! Contrary to the very few negative reviews that are on here, these tacos are amazing! Here is why, the corn tortillas they use are nice and thick and very very tasty. They are definitely of the street Taco variety so make sure you order enough, and my preference is the pork or pastor tacos, but both are very delicious. The meat is very tender, and the toppings are super fresh; you could taste the sweetness of the onion, you can taste the really ripe flavor of the guacamole and the Salsa's are well-balanced both in the medium and also the hot; a perfect mix of Smokey and Spice. Services pretty fast despite the fact that there are a ton of people ordering. If you're even within 10 or 15 miles of this place you have to make this one of your stops or literally the best tacos on the west side! I just finished eating, and I cannot wait for the next time I'm back here!"

I only really care about the Pho, so that's what the 5 stars are all about. Do people actually order other things on the menu in Vietnamese restaurants aside from the Pho? For me, it's just a given. If it's on the menu I get tunnel vision. I accept it. 

The service was great, delicious Pho, and the sizes of the bowls are pretty gnarly even considering the price. Not very expensive at all. Fan. Pho. Life."
MVbPhIyvVkfn1u2YquxRiA,1,"About 2 years ago my truck was in a wreck and I picked Mattloque Taylor to fix it for me. I thought I was saving a buck by not going to the mechanics that the insurance company recommended. I went through a Facebook group.  Well, he kept my vehicle 4 close to a year and kept claiming that the parts were hard to find and coming up with different excuses every time and this was with me calling on a daily basis! The final straw was when he said he was going to take my truck to another one of his friends shop to get the framework done. But he was very vague about where it was and could not even  give me a name or address. Finally I told him that just get the vehicle ready and I will be there to pick it up with the tow truck. He then sends me a text saying that I owe him $3,000 for disassembly fee. And the next morning I get a text saying that the truck is ready for me to pick up although it was still disassembled. Apparently, he checked and found that there's a lien on the vehicle.  So there was no way he could keep it. He still owes me for an airbag assembly. Later on I found out it was a higher-end vehicle. I didn't know it when I bought it. I think he saw the opportunity to make a scam because the day before I said I was going to pick it up he said he was going to take it to a friend of his to work on the frame but he wouldn't tell me where. Yes he is a cheat. And a very despicable person. At the time my daughter was going through chemotherapy and I pleaded with him to please fix my vehicle because I had a very difficult time getting her to her treatments. If I knew how, I would sue him."
tZ0lfbY4fXNsZcwyJm9ogA,3,"The check in person had the sign in board. She was huddled over it like it was a fetus with no body warmth of its's own. When we asked to sign in she said NO  almost yelling. After three people were signed in, 25 minutes later she said we could sign in, it had a time checked in, thats why she was blocking it, so it wouldn't show accurate times.
 Afeter all that we were informed that one test needed to be done before 9AM. Well, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN!
My daughter has tiny veins that collapse easily. I'm torn here because the phlebotomists are EXCELLENT! They really care, and listen to what we say when we tell them what won't work. If they have to do more than one stick they are genuinely upset for her.
 However, they also accidentally lost paperwork, so we didn't get half the tests. Additionally, they didn't take enough blood the first time so the Dr sent us back! All in all we've gone back four times,  Thats; WAY to many times for us to get her stabbed.
 If they get it together they would have an awesome team, but they are NOT there."
yIXU0MLS-J5KPnHmpy90IQ,5,"Oh my gosh, don't know where to start. Finding a high-class, romantic atmosphere for dinner in Vegas can be TOUGH -- you either dress down for the day or wait til almost midnight to put on heels. This place is perfect for an anniversary or birthday, whether it's just two of you or in a group. It's definitely pricey, but you get what you pay for -- amazing food (seafood is mostly fresh with an italian twist) and the service was probably the best I've experienced anywhere in the world. 

If you / your group is planning drinking, definitely book a cabana outside (it's a $150/person minimum). The view is gorgeous and the atmosphere even cozier. Definitely my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."

j8TqiFpIZJjCsm4cvMHTzQ,5,"Can a single meal completely change your perception of fine dining?

Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?

I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.

It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. 

After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. 

Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. 

Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**
A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.

**COURSE #1**
Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.

**COURSE #2**
Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.

**COURSE #3**
48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.

**COURSE #4**
Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. 

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**
Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.

After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.

This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.

If you subscribe to the ""you only live once"" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must."

The staff is very friendly and they spoil him rotten, which makes me feel good about leaving him.  I don't have to worry because I know he is in a safe place. He gets to play, socialize and work out some energy and usually sleeps for a couple of days. I would recommend Camp Bow Wow if you need a safe and secure place to leave your pet for vacation or just days you need a break."

The Hubby had the blue berry waffle/pancake (can't remember) but I do remember it being amazing!! Soooooo blueberry -eeeee and made well.  They offered to send us with coffee to go!! They are the best!!"
C_oCpNq91uTtOYUs2cChdg,4,"Came here on a whim as we were passing through Vegas on a road trip. We were craving pizza, but didn't want anything too fancy or takeout. This place was perfect! We ordered at the counter and got our food about 15 min later. They had basic toppings and some unique ones. We topped ours off with garlic and were excited when we saw the pizza adorned with giant cloves.  I'm not a big fan of crust and usually give it to my hubby. However, this crust was not shareable. I devoured every flaky last bit of it. The server offered us some garlic dip and I jumped at the chance because I never pass up sauce. This was some of the best pizzas I've had in a while!!!"
oV1oeR4IxDEWeldNea0hrA,4,"Great place to stop before getting into Las Vegas. They also have a Dunkin' Donuts! They also have a restaurant/buffet. The breakfast buffet isn't that great. 

The exotic racing is across the street & nice to watch!"
OkHEaSGeRGDnibGL9PEXqA,4,"Sweat pants-wearing, NASCAR-watching, BudLight-slurping humanoids aren't as easily converted to specialty coffee as hipsters and city folk. I'm not judging such fate as a ghastly act of mankind; it's just that in this neck of the woods, we have to take what we can get. 

If I was to rate this based on the single pour-over I have tasted from here, it would be a solid five stars. I was highly pleased to find that they had Akron Coffee on bar because Akron Coffee is the new best coffee in the [Akron] area. But it was my first time to try it so I played it safe with a Yirgacheffe pour-over which was said to have a pleasant balance of strawberries, cocoa and cinnamon. And yes, it was wow, quite pleasant indeed. It was very sweet and as it cooled it became increasingly buttery. In fact, the last of it got entirely cold and at that point it became one of the most butteryest, most smoothest, most bestest coffees I've ever slorked. In contrast, I sampled a bit of Oak Grove coffee of forgotten origin brewed via airpot, which was not so pleasant. 

They don't do espresso which is understandably a problem for some people. But for me, I find a bit of joy in seeing others as dedicated to high quality drip and filter coffee as I am myself. It's so much simpler that way and that's how these guys operate. A clean well designed coffee house with a simple menu is all anyone has ever needed. It's true. Less I better. Sometimes."

Her line work is fantastic, her individual designs are awesome, the shading and coloring is just awesome.  I'm getting redundant, you should just go book your next tattoo with her ASAP.

In addition to her Daria, one of their piercers, is great as well. I've only had her help me change jewelery at this point, but even that she's knowledgeable in.  She's done piercings on friends of mine, and I'd recommend her to anyone.

Its nice to go into a shop where the people are friendly and not cooler than you because they're more alt than you are.  If you want something minor to something major they're great people to go to."

g9XYSoU-tSzx-MNicY_R7Q,3,"Food is 5 star, if I could give service a minus I would so combined a 2. My wife and I are frequent diners here going back over 20 years and when we went on Wednesday April 11th it was the worst service ever people that came in at least 10 minutes after us were served and almost done eating before we got food. If not for the fact that I know how good the smothered pork chops are I would have walked out."
erPGdtO4PduiuRSayPMLnQ,5,"Great food.  Top 1 or 2 restaurants in az for Italian. 

Don't bother ordering off the menu for dinner!!

Get one of the specials!

The beef tortoloni and the pasta with squid ink are ridiculously good!  The buffalo mozzarella appetizer is a must. 


Atmosphere is fun, decent wine list.  I make it here once a month."

oB-9h4MB26ftzj0jJn0cfA,5,"I am a huge Teriyaki chicken fan, so I tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  My fellow yelp'ers weren't far off the mark.  I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  The meal arrived at my table quickly.  Upon first bite, I was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet.  This sauce is not as sweet, but much more flavorful.  The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  

Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.

All in all, a great experience.  I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise!  Great job, Blue Fin!"
_giCWgBPTdfnAGHnj5W8PQ,5,"Great service, the blended drinks are delicious and I love all the different options!"
EYYB9DlmA6kbOQIvDaIUJQ,2,"If i could, I would rate it 0 stars. I bought a pound of jalebi and it tasted terrible. It left a terrible itch in my throat that other jellaba's did not cause. Along with the overpriced terrible jalebi, I was served with a rude hostess. Who thought it was more important to chit chat with friends while taking my order.

I visited this store due to the ratings but after this experience I will be returning to this store. I would normally not post a review but I don't want others to be fooled by the positive reviews."
PUwnqBvL6Pyy7-1khhpDFw,1,"Don't ever use this shop!!!! It's a complete joke. They will come up with every lie they can to why your car isn't finished when it is suppose to be. I dropped my car off over a month and a half ago for a issue that they said would take a week. After constant calls on my end to get updates and nothing but excuses on their end I finally picked the car up myself. I was told it was all fixed however when I picked it up nothing was fixed. They actually broke my main window switch motor while it was at their shop in addition to not fixing the issue that I took it in for. 

I HIGHLY recommend to everyone not to use this shop. You will be unhappy and regretful if you do."
kdbQW8tGJc90eaOtXI5SPQ,5,My wife and I go here quite a bit and I just realized that I haven't written a review. We actually held our wedding reception in there back room. They serve great food from Mexico City. Our preferred server is Enrique!!!! He is awesome and takes great care of us. Everyone is very nice and Jorge the manager is very awesome to work with. The prices are great as well.
vHBilF1n2gxGU9xJ3AIjwQ,1,Beautiful location.  Terrible service.  Food is fine at best.  Watched my server complain about me after receiving a disgusting cold and soggy sandwich that was not described accurately in the menu at all.  Honestly such a waste.  I've been here multiple times and every time there is an issue and I'm not even that picky or confrontational.  I work at a restaurant like it's not that hard.
wOT4VFLcVvqgpCqH6kAVVw,3,"With such glowing recommendations, Boralia had been top of my hit list for months. Their aboriginal inspired native food seemed to be all the rave but sadly we left underwhelmed and still hungry. 

A small and intimate restaurant on the Ossington strip, reservations could be hard to come by and our party of 7 had a strict 2.5 hours reso timeframe to follow. We practically ordered the full menu:

- Smoked mussels ($17): intriguing presentation of their mussels concealed by a cloud of smoke. The smokey taste was interesting but the mussels were too skinny and lacked their sweet juiciness.

- Cured trout over cedar branches ($15): again nice presentation but it ends about there.. The trout was tough and bland and the pieces were tiny.

- Venison and foie gras parfait ($15): if there was one thing I'd recommend it would be this - definitely the best dish we had from the menu. The foie gras parfait was sweet, light, silky and had a meaty savoury tanginess to it. 

- Pan roasted elk ($16): this was very tender with a great sear on them and worth trying as elk is not a regular menu item. 

- Pigeon pie ($24): first time having pigeon pie and I can't say I'm looking forward to the second. Literally just tasted like a regular meat pie.. And at $24 for a small pie it was quite forgettable.

There were some good dishes but nothing jumped out as a show stopper. Overall be prepared for small and dainty dishes that will take many plates (and $$) to fill you up. We also felt like it was a rushed dining experience and we were reminded to stick within our timeframe at various times. Really wanted to support an authentic Canadian cuisine but the meal just didn't deliver the experience we were hoping for."
CL-VSle2UqGk3_wti1xIbA,4,"This place is a gem amongst the other divy spots in the neighbourhood. It is kept clean and the everything is legit fresh as you will see when ordering. My girlfriend ordered the beef tacos and said it was the best tacos she has ever had at an establishment. I had the slow cooked beef burrito and I don't know what kind of sauce they use but man oh man is it really good. I am a huge fan of Burrito Boyz but this thing gave it a run for its money without a doubt.

We plan on going by again this week to have a smoothie that is actually made with real fruit and I have to try the tacos now as my gf refused to share. The staff were also very friendly and hopefully they can open up another location near us North Toronto. If you are in the area and you want very tasty food that gives you bang for your buck check this place out."
kXvrV_ZQ72qiugm-xbX1Ug,4,"I haven't been to a movie in forever, but went Saturday night to Stonecrest. They have an automated ATM machine like ticket ordering, ie, you don't talk to a person. I wasn't crazy about that. It wasn't as easy as I hoped it would be to find the show and time I wanted. But, I managed through it. And the ticket wasn't cheap, $12 a piece. But once in the theater it was super nice. We had reserved seating (you select your seat when you purchase your ticket). And the seats are nice recliners. Unfortunately, our movie was almost sold out and the only 2 tickets together were on the front row. That would have be very awkward, but the fully reclining seat let us recline back and thus the viewing angle to the screen was fine. Still a little awkward being so close to the screen, but it worked. The best thing here was the space you have in these nice chairs, you don't feel like you are sitting up next to a stranger. Good job!"
pRytJccuwae5LyfObqyx2A,4,"Great food!  Calamari app was amazing!!
Ordered mahi Mahi which was good.  But still thinking about the calamari app."
JiNYRRpEpDpXpAlNaRz2YA,1,WTHeck! Is this place EVER open???? I've been there twice for lunch and they've been closed. Their website needs to be updated. When I've called I get a recording saying they're busy so of course that makes me think they're open.
Oi9178nk8Ib1sGl0fL6RqQ,4,"I've been here a few times & service is always excellent. Food is great & a very diverse menu for a bar. Pricing is a bit steep on drinks for being off-strip, so I wouldn't make it a regular stop, but a fun place overall."
HrEbcslQq4_oINhjzLkONQ,5,"This is our 3rd time to this amazing family owned and operated restaurant. Thank you Sherry (owner) for always making us feel so welcomed and part of your family. We absolutely love the food, service and awesome entertainment!!! Best restaurant in the East Valley."
oce9dqOUTnPnKRDxmVlyBw,3,"I had wanted to try the happy hour here but just missed it (ends at 6) and decided to stay and try out dinner. They have a nice big patio along a not too busy street. This is a nice place to come on a date in this area. 

I asked if they made any of their pastas in house and the only one that I was told was made fresh was the fettuccine so I substituted it in the garganelli carbonara dish. It was yummy. A good balance of pasta, sauce, chicken and spinach. I usually never have enough chicken for the pasta, but I actually had chicken and not pasta left. My boyfriend had the lasagna. I took one bite and thought it was really good. He said it had some hard chunks of tomato that he wasn't too fond of. We asked for more bread, which never came because it was frozen or something. We were told it was delayed, but it never came. 

We had the vanilla bean creme brulee and caramel creme brulee. It was served in these small tea cups which were the perfect size for an after dinner treat. The caramel was my favorite and they were only $2.45 each. 

I didn't try the bruschetta, but it looked delicious and I will definitely come back to try it. 

Please bring your patience. It took over an hour and a half to have dinner here and all we had were our pasta dishes and dessert (no appetizer or salads)."
8Osf-0rhsjwmM6qPqahtig,5,"I've been going to this HD for years, it's like a second home for me. The staff are great and friendly. They're experienced and was able to help me with any and all my problems."
tnOB9UA9Bj04EA_EZVah3w,3,"This is a very upscale Persian restaurant, equipped with authentic appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The decor was very traditional and atmosphere was vibrant. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken kabob over long rice. The koobideh kabob tasted a bit gamey for my taste. The chicken and koobideh rice platter was on the pricier side, $20 to be exact. The service was good just very very slow. It seemed as if the host was the only one working on the floor on the night that I came. He greeted, seated, took our drink and entree orders, brought out the food, refilled our waters, brought us our check and to-go boxes. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night and they figured it wouldn't be a busy one that they didn't need anyone else working on the floor? Aside from the slow service, they get an A+ for making their female patrons feel loved and appreciated at the end of their meal. Every woman is offered a long stem rose to take home with them. I've never experienced this at a restaurant before so I thought this was a brilliant idea. This place is a great date night spot for Persian cuisine."
ZqRIBOmEm3R8ZFdF8J0XgQ,5,"Holy shnikeys this is good sushi.  I have been coming here for a few years now and I love this place.  Good Price and very creative menu.  Don't get fooled by the all-you-can eat.  It is made to order, fresh and have some good creativity.  It is my favorite sushi  joint.  Love you guys"
n-0BfdTzfo6NsHApjkbxqQ,1,"Bill had many errors, all in hotel's favor. The shower was dangerous. We set the temperature, then showered as the temperature of the water, all on its own, fluctuated between cold to scalding. Reported to hotel staff - it was not fixed. 

Television did not work until second night. 

This hotel is pretty, but looks can be deceiving."
vre5sK2UxIoTii0gKdDoYQ,2,Been here a couple times first time the service was terrible so bad I left change on the table. This most recent time the service was way better for the waiter the hostess looked pissed and didn't even greet us. The fries were good but weren't cooked fully. We had the parmesan truffle fries the mayo sauce is awesome! Ordered one of there specialty drinks the spicy margarita and it came with some leaf that ruined the entire drink I couldn't stop smelling the weird leaf after i took it out. Had the farm burger and had to have it sent back as the egg was over cooked took another 20 minutes for me to get my new burger which the egg was cooked right but the burger was burnt this time. I ended up paying and leaving after taking 2 bites. Overall I most likely wouldn't go back they need Gordon to come in and give them hell
joBjrwVP9w4wKxNylKLcxQ,3,The food and service were good but this place is pricey. We love the moroccan flavor in the lamb shank. The pate is ok. I had better at Trader Joe. We thought the $10 cork fee was ridiculous. BYOB  restaurants in Chicago offer everything you need to enjoy your alcohol beverage at no cost.
byvDX4tvNpEjhyTJqCPj5Q,3,"I like this place for all of its outside real estate, I don't like the cups they put your cappacino in."
VIogKttAwizctuLhMHq6ZA,5,"One of the best studios in the city with very good instructors. If you love Bikram or Moksha yoga, try this place out. You won't be disappointed"
aWOZiUEzhSgrEGiI2bwTKw,4,"Their juice membership is worth the 5 stars alone ($10 per month for $3 unlimited juices) but the juices are actually SOOOOOOO tasty. And their shakes, which often change. I am a big fan of cold pressed juice, but so sick of seeing the usual juice formulas and equations. I like to be shook up a little.

Throw in the juice customization... it just makes no sense to go anywhere else. Plus you're attached to Skinnyfats. Which is bomb in itself."
gurfwRywAgz0dGEYhq_Lnw,5,"Really good good avacado and bacon omelet. The banana nut muffin was delicious, and they bring you a carafe of coffee!  We sat out on the patio, the airplanes overhead were low and of course loud and often. But it's a cool spot with very friendly wait staff. Oh and the chorizo scramble is very good, my partner loved it!"
SZYAkPDGDAKZpi2hLcTsQQ,3,"One for their loyalty program.  Tried to enter app at  the store and said it was down . Tried again the next day and now says the receipt is to old. Won't accept my two sandwiches.  Kinda getting discourage with these programs that say when you can use them, how you cam use them and what minutes of the day while wearing a tutu you can redeem them .Have had no problems using Farmer Boys."
Elz8pYAQMtpPvBr0WJoGBw,4,Not busy for a Saturday night. Rolls came out quick and we're tasty. Not fantastic or over the top delicious. Baked mussels were our favorite along with the Japanese burrito. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that the place was empty. Beside our group there were only 2 other customers.
LffBHBsGLmy0VwrwznWR-Q,4,"I actually really like south st. burger co, because they have guacamole!! and I always ask for LOTS of it, yum! besides that I find the burger juicy and not dry, I like the CHEESE options and This is one of my fav locations because they person putting my burger together is very generous on the ingredients, and you can always for extra, I always get more tomatoes also yum. The toppings are endless and this is why I love coming here. 

It also helps that they search NEW YORK FRIES! yum! 

it just some times annoys me when the person in front of me doesn't know what they want on their burger or takes forever to decide."
K5dRb9w47jTOZnTW4KXWdg,4,"Last year, when we bought our new home, we bought several rooms of furniture from Mor Furniture.  As in the past, the service and price was great.

Today I ran in to make a very special purchase - a power recliner - which I needed quickly and it had to be comfortable enough for someone to sleep in.

My sales associate, Maddox Almon, was awesome.  Spent the time to go over all of the available chairs, sharing feedback from other clients who had purchased them in the past.  So many stores today just don't give you that specialized service, especially when it's just for one piece of furniture.

Took one less worry off of my mind to know that my husband will have what he needs when he's home from the hospital.  A big kudos to Maddox for being so helpful and concerned that I found exactly what I needed at the price that I could afford."
F0x5GUMMnaLNemJVLz0Jdg,4,"Wow! This theatre has redefined a night out at the movies. They've taken everything we dislike about most movie theatres and replaced it with a new way to cater to America's favorite obsession. Here are some examples (but you've gotta experience this for yourself to fully appreciate it):

Typical theatre: Get to the movie early so you can beat the crowds and find a good seat. 
Esplanade 14: Choose your seat beforehand (all seats same price)

Typical theatre: stand in line at the concession stand and give up a better seat or part of your movie and expect major price gouging. 
Esplanade 14: pay reasonably priced concessions from the comfort of your seat with the help of a server (included). 

Typical theatre: small, dirty/sticky, cloth seats with little leg room
Esplanade 14: big plush leather seats with a fold out table with so much leg room you should never touch the seat in front of you. And they were thinking large Americans here- No problems for the 300+ pounders. They won't be spilling over into the seat next to them.  These seats rock!...literally 

Typical theatre: various popcorn sizes and drink sizes all rediculously priced. 
Esplanade 14: one popcorn size 7.50 (free refills and large enough to feed anyone), one drink size (large with free refills). Not a rip off either. 

Typical theatre: $10-$11
Esplanade 14: $13 and probably should cost more. 

Only one negative thing to say:
I don't like the extra butter for my popcorn on the side in a small plastic cup. I don't know how to put it on like the specially trained concessions staff and it's difficult in the dark. The theatre should complete the preparation of the popcorn before it reaches your seat."
Hsu0s86uoEjxrfTQLqAhZg,4,"The place is old, but really, this is all you need to know: Good steak and eggs! Good steak dinner special! Tall pilsners of good beer! All available for a great price! 

Oh, one other thing: hilariously fun karaoke."
EB7FX70sYjUilZx9oaSyXw,1,"This place is awesomely dumpy!  The only reason we even bothered staying here is because it was $25 a night.  It's also in a prime location on the strip so we could get the hell out and into much better hotels really fast.  We tried our hardest to spend as little waking time in there as possible.  If you want a real laugh, check out their karaoke bar.  Their dealers are forced to dress up as musical acts, I'm pretty sure that violates some cruelty laws.

I'm pretty sure it's gonna get torn down soon."
IRlVnviEbM1bc2Hx6_31dA,4,"This is the only strip club I've ever been to, so I'm not sure where it rates on the grand scale.

I went here for my bachelorette, though I didn't get dolled up in a crazy outfit and we couldn't afford the front row bottle service (which was like $300). We were kind of at a little table off to the side being less rowdy so we didn't get AS much attention from the dancers.

But it was still a pretty memorable experience.

We went on a Saturday night, when there was male stripping for ladies on one floor and male stripping for gay men on another. The dancers were all pretty well muscled and athletic. The stage seemed to alternate between the moderately talented and the really impressive ones. Some of the acts were cheesy, some of them were more raunchy. 

The VIP lounge wasn't quite what I'd expected. I have male friends who've been to regular strip clubs, so I thought the lap dance would have a lot of rules about touching or something...nope. ;) 

I think there was probably like 10 other bachelorettes going on at the same time, so there was quite a bit of screaming from rowdy ladies. Some of them were paying the dancers to drag their friends up on stage. 

I only plan on getting married once, but I wouldn't mind going back for a second look, now that I have a better understanding of the experience. Maybe my next birthday party? ;)"
UK5rvJ3v4gdwphKkK8ueoA,4,"You get what you pay for! I love this place because of how much you get for the price! I tried this place because we had samples at work and I found the bowls to be refreshing and a great summer pick me up! 

I returned a few months later to explore the menu and found the menu to be a wide variety of deliciousness! They have sandwiches, smoothies, juices, soups, salads, bowls! It was a great selection. I ended up just order an acai bowl and it was (I believe 20oz) for something around $11, which isn't bad at all! 

I love the serving size to cost and I love the wide selection. 

The only reason this review is only 4 stars is because the customer service could use some improvement. The cashier wasn't well informed about the menu and item availability. She wasn't familiar with the usage of the cashier system either. And the time between ordering and receiving your order is quite a long time. It needs some customer service improvements."
7m_F-z_1O00x2LRIWoBuYA,5,"Simply the best in town! Yummy! Their boba is so smooth and slightly soft on the outside, chewy all the way through to the center with an increasing but very slight gradient of firmness, and at least one to two chews before structurally collapsing."
tS4XBYLT_7JFnAXfc3CV_A,2,"The food was cold, the waitress was slow, and the customer service was just okay. I came by thinking I was going to eat at the Good Egg stopped by gave it a chance I wish I should've kept going. I will not return, the food is not the same as it was."
GGlHpbt_cGL7akMEDKxcyw,5,"Ever since my bf recently discovered frozen yogurt (yeah, he's a little slow to jump on the bandwagon), we've been trying different yogurt places around town. I usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals, so thank goodness it's lower in fat! I'm 5'6"" and trying to keep up with a 6'2"" man's metabolism here. 

Yogurtland has been our favorite. They have an excellent selection with a wide variety of flavors and toppings. We tried a bunch of flavors and both ended up doing a strawberry/cheesecake mix with strawberries, blueberries, and walnuts on top. We also added a few of their little cheese cake bites. Their yogurt's taste and texture is perfect.  

When the cashier rang us up, we thought she had only totalled one of our yogurts by accident.... could it be only $6 for two pretty fully loaded cups of yogurt?? Normally, ONE yogurt runs us $5-6. Not only is it good, it's cheap too?! That gets my stamp of approval."
hdg2EJsywrdr9UcDhuY4tg,1,"I was so excited for this place to open up by my house. Who doesn't want access to boba, cupcakes, and frozen yogurt across the street? This place was good when it opened. I've never seen a cupcake in the shop like they advertise, and it seems the boba has become nonexistent. Everytime I go there, they are 'out of boba'. Did they have any in the first place?
There is a very sweet girl that is usually working there, but I tend to steer clear of yolli pop when two idiot male staff (one couldn't figure out how to scan debit, so his buddy decided to help him out)  charged my boyfriends debit card $500,000 dollars for two yogurts totaling to $8.53. I don't even know how you would come up with that number. And yes, i did say $500,000. Needless to say, the bank froze his account for weeks until we finally figured out it wasn't bouncing, they shut it off for fraud. 
We talked to a manager, and she put us on the phone with the store owner. We gave him our name and number, and got 0 calls back about finding out what happened or given a receipt to give to our bank. 
I would come back, (cash of course) for a simple yogurt, but I wouldn't expect anything better than mediocre from them.
I hope the chances of somebody getting the debit card charged are safe, because those bozo's are still employed there!"
YUhE6fB6i67bNnkCbq4JGA,4,Food was delicious. Prices are managable. Cheese cake is out of this world! Only have to take a star off because it gets loud in the restaurant and alcoholic drinks are too pricey for what you get.
gMnkqM8-OluNULWZjli4Ww,5,I would disagree with anyone who says this place is overhyped. Love the farm-to-table emphasis. Love the laid-back vibe. The food was creatively prepared and damn tasty. Try the beet salad.
kBgzH0YFt7-P3XR44W57ng,3,"Pretentious, ok food, over-priced, slow kitchen, $22 Bacon Burger, $12 Beer...
Cross the street to Le Burger Brasserie at Paris, better food, better service, better prices at a sports grille"
LeRM0_k3zTqAAuoHcOSC3A,4,"Jims is a great place to go and get a greasy down home breakfast. The staff is great. We always make sure to sit in the same place to get our usual waitress. 

Once you've gone a few times the waitress will ask you your name and will remember you the next time you go. We always go here for Mothers Day, which is alot of fun because I always get hugs from the staff. Haven't been in a while because I am trying to lose weight and this isn't the place to go to do so. But, one day I will be back, and I can guarantee they will remember me. 

The only downside to this restaurant is the bathrooms. They are gross! And, of course, every time we go my 5 year old has to use them. We have gotten used to them though and tolerate it because we love the friendliness of the staff. 

We have taken our family there for breakfast when they come in from out of town and they love it here too. It has a small town feel. 

We have had large groups of 20 people, and they have a backroom that was perfect for that."
xjDhhBL3mNs0vrn7xEgfIg,5,"I think this is an awesome apartment complex. Alison and the management are super helpful, friendly and professional. Love the pool (my daughter learned to swim here and I do laps). I use the nice gym a lot too. The apartment complex is brand new and attractive with really nicely finished apartments. My air conditioning bill was really low in the summer because the apartments are so well insulated/energy efficient. The apartments are, I believe, in the best school district in the Phoenix area my daughter loves Madison Simis Elementary which we walk to, as it is only a few blocks away. The apartments come with a free 42' flatscreen and I have my friends over for football games. Being right next to Safeway supermarket I just walk to buy food which is convenient. My daughter has a lot of little friends here as we meet people at the public patio, BBQ, fire pit, pool and I have gotten to know the parents well. The grounds are a well maintained with lots of flowers. It is really one of the nicest apartment complexes my family has stayed in."
gBRSfdtWzl7A1eDqGqpsIg,1,Not worth the extra wait! It's been over 2 hours in line. It's after 2AM right now! You have no idea lol! I blame myself for not checking Yelp beforehand! The staff seem fine but just badly undermanned.
FY7gLQWRsW-PQUd1jFWpmA,5,The Gold Coast Hotel was AWESOME!! My Wife and I spend a total of 4 nights here because we were getting married in Vegas. We ordered a basic room for our 4 nights and had reserved additional rooms for other guests of our wedding. My wife's parents had plane issues and we had to cancel one of the nights we had reserved for them. My wife called the gold coast and explained to them that this was our wedding weekend and the issues some of the guests were experiencing with flights. The next day when they arrived we went with them to the front desk to help with check-in. Brittney the front desk attendant was extremely nice and had been informed that this was our wedding weekend. She upgraded my in-laws to a beautiful sweet I'm assuming with the idea that they would trade us rooms. Her assumption was right and My Wife and I were able to have an absolutely beautiful suite for the last two nights of our stay. Both rooms were beautiful and well taken care of. The TGIF downstairs was extremely good as was the subway. The casino offered lots games to spend some of that wedding money on as well. Overall if I came back to Vegas I would definitely stay at the gold coast again it was perfect!
bn-MPSZqsFShOHuzJ5eovw,3,"Having been to the old Swan, I guess I expected it to be similar. It's not. The new Swan is waaaaay overpriced for what they deliver. You order scrambled eggs, then pay for add-ons like cheese, mushrooms, peppers etc. And $4 for 2 slices of bacon? Please. I ordered eggs, bacon and 2 americanos and the bill was $25 before tip. Other spots nearby are better and less pricey."
HhW5gD8Ohnx68oY83v1SVw,5,Great place! You totally would not expect a great sushi restaurant from the outside! Looks like an old 1950's diner. Definitely try the Roppogni Roll and Baked Muscles.
A6ywW160gy-FzvZFbuK7hA,3,Great place and a lot of fun! Would of been 5 stars but the service was terrible. First off my valid Texas I.D. was denied by the manager who was a complete dick. Second off its mid summer and over 90 degrees outside and it took over 20 min to get a pitcher of water and then another 15 for them to bring out glasses to go with the pitcher. Our waitress was gone the whole time.. The worst part is that all the employees were sitting around chatting while we were waiting. COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL AND HORRIBLE SERVICE!
ptUHqsRWLGjtaUeWebDVGQ,3,"I've been wanting to try Butter Avenue for a while and finally got around to it this weekend. No complaints about the macarons themselves, they were delicious. I tried the lavender & apricot, coffee, ​and pistachio flavors. The coffee one was a little strong for my liking, but the other two were AMAZING. 

That said, the two staff members I encountered were very rude. I was taken aback by their lack of interest in communicating about the product and making the experience enjoyable for customers. Since I've heard such great things, this aspect was a huge letdown. 

Not sure if I'll return to this location for that reason, but can't disagree with the many reviews that confirm the macarons are super yummy!"
HG2YJ2Hv2Ae6LtukhdQaxQ,5,Their al pastor tacos are ridiculous...best I've ever had!!  Be prepared to wait though.  It took me around 45 minutes to get my food :(
xTjExWFGOeGsA9xWMlM2Rw,2,"We live across the street so we ordered to pickup a cold Italian sub and a spinach and pepperoni calzone and I asked for two extra sides of ranch (this was all off of the Eat24 app) when I got here they said ranch was extra and that the amount I paid on the app didn't cover it. I'd didn't mind so I pains anyways. 

When we got home the fries where a little stale and corner of the sub was a little soggy but over all it was alright. Not worth $9. The subs from subway taste better then this and they're only $5. 

The calzone was the greasiest thing ever. It tasted alright but it was also kind of stale. It was pretty large. Maybe if it had been fresh made...

Oh and the ""ranch"" was SOOOOO WATERED DOWN LIKE MY GOODNESS. We opened it to pour some on the fries and it turned clear when it touched surface because it was so watered down.  

We only spent about 24$ and it was a lot of food so I guess not too expensive but not worth it tbh"
5Xi-LSulVXvnKVqOT-ssdQ,5,"Took my friend's car there while she was out of town since she had the super saver card thing, seems like a good deal.  The guys were really nice and quick.  Had a 9am appt, got there just after 9 and was out before 10!"

Factors of annoyance: certainly the birds can catch you off guard a little; what can you say, they're jus .. Birds .. That's what they do.. Am not sure if the management could or should do anything about this, I don't have an opinion on this at this point, but left to me, I'd prefer not to have those birds super close to the food.

Now the good parts- the wait time was pretty accurate, they brought the food out in time, and as my rating reflects, the food was just delicious! We had the crab Benedict and French toast, both very well made and presented. 

Gabriel was our waiter and he was terrific! Informative and good humored; simple enough you'd think, but those are two qualities that have become quite hard to find  of late at restaurants (yeah am talking about a bunch of other Vegas joints including Gordon Ramsay's burgr)

Sure to return to the terrace pointe cafe!!"
8JZtHF4FyTAl6Mdvj-N93A,4,"Me and a few buds were wanting to grab a burger so opted to try Twin Peaks on an early afternoon. Plenty of TVs going with good sports action. Their hot wings with standard sauce were outstanding. I was surprised that their twin peaks burger rocked pretty good; i destroyed it and the fries. All said better than average. Next time I'll be hammering out more wings... Gordon Ramsay's BurGR & fries were better, but 40% more...."
xrxaUz3yk_JTLjArD1k1hg,4,"The food at Studio B: its quality leaves a lasting impression.  The weekday lunch buffet (at $14.95) is excellent, and even that comes with wine and beer.  The grilled New York steaks are heavenly, medium-rare to medium, just the right portion, and you can go back for more.  Rotisserie chicken, carve-to-order.  Several Thai and Vietnamese salads are uncommon elsewhere.  Many good Italian dishes, both hot and room-temp.  Overall, so many things are made well; it's about quality.

It no longer serves breakfast, so finding any eggs is difficult.  But if you look hard enough, you'll find chunks of egg in the Singapore noodles.

And, a make-to-order espresso bar that goes with all those sweets (tiny Tiramisù, crepes, crème brûlée...).  But the line can be long because desserts and coffee are in the same place; the person manning the espresso bar also has to scoop gelato.   

If you stroll around the place after a big meal, check out the first floor where it has a pool piazza, spa & salon, ""Hostile Grape,"" and all the meeting and business facilities (nicely isolated from the casino above).

Miles from the Strip, at the southernmost Las Vegas Bl., the M Resort is a pretty nice place: small, but sophisticated.  Coming from/to Southern California, it is the first one in and the last one out.

A side note for those who are wondering, the ""M"" is a property of the Marnells, a father-and-son team (Anthony Marnell, II and III).  The family has an architecture & development company, Marnell Corrao Associates, that has done many projects on the Strip: The Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn..., among others."
Jy88ZEIt1bWZFisJ6ixM5w,3,"We stayed at the Bellagio for 3 days. On our first day, we were pretty hungry but also too tired to explore the restaurants outside of the hotel, so we came here.
the service here was slow, and the food was ok. I had their Veggie burger which was delicious and my fiance had the chicken salad.  
There are much better options in Vegas, but not a whole lot in the Bellagio."
0PzdiTSz6u_fn8T83BI05w,4,"Decent place with a variety of menu items. Most entrees come with the bottomless salad, which I'm a fan of, especially the house Italian dressing. I've come here a number of times and have gotten the sirloin steaks, Hawaiian chicken, and stuff flounder, each item was pretty good. The prices are very reasonable and I'll definitely come back in the future."
Qqo8tJ287aiEzTNTaRtj1A,4,"I booked a room on Price Line for two nights. $80 bucks total out the door. 

My wife and I used the room as a recovery room after a surgery. The staff was more then welcome to help us in every way possible.  They allowed us to stay until 3pm when the norm is 11am. They brought in a small fridge to use while there also. 

The room was a standard sized with 2 queen beds, a TV and a desk. The room was spic and span clean, and very comfortable. You can actually purchase the bed and the bedding online. 

They have wired Internet in all rooms. Which I used to stay connected to work. It was not blazing fast but it did work.

The indoor pool is nice but never saw anyone in it. The indoor spa was luke warm and the bubbles blow up your butt on on your back. Strange. 

The outdoor pool was freezing and I saw one surprised girl jump in. The outdoor spa was very hot and had zero pressure out of the jets. It was still nice to veg a little and relax the back. Much better then the hospital chair/bed!

The complex was very quiet and pretty well maintained. I will stay here again if I had to."

I ended up here to have late night dinner after drinking and walking around with friends. Anyways their menu has a huge selection and I went in for the ""late night menu"" starts from 10pm till 2. To start as an appetizer I ordered onion ring tower (these were soo good you must try them!) for my entree I ordered the Black truffle cheeseburger (7.95) medium well, & it was delicious! Super flavorful meat well seasoned and juicy! 
Along with that I ordered a side of truffle fries (4.25) the fries I'll give it 3 stars it was too salty! :( other than that everything else was bomb. Com :)"
vkynvofMUnvY3pcaS0gqMA,5,"I just moved to Arizona from New Hampshire and was in need of a new hair stylist.  I work down the street and saw the salon; even with it under construction, I made an appointment with Susie.  Turned out to be one of the best hair cuts and styles I ever got.  Susie is a great stylist.  I have been back several times and she is my new stylist for good.  Every hair cut seems to get better each time I see her.  I started with pretty short hair and Susie has been shaping it while I grow it out, which is usually so hard to do.  Susie also gives a great shampoo.  

In spite of the construction outside, the salon is really nice and bright.  I highly recommend making an appointment with Susie, you won't be disappointed."
oRK4Cvz7GdvfrE-6erT--g,2,"Not much good to say at all about this place. We live in the neighborhood and wanted to give this place a shot. I immediately regretted even walking in the door. Our food was totally flavorless and a horrible value. I ordered the ""Hammered Hog"" sandwich, which touted a 1/2 pound of our house smoked pulled pork covered with blue cheese cole slaw. My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich which stated it had a 1/3 pound of pulled pork on it. I swear, their was more meat on hers and mine was a buck more. Not that I would have wanted more meat, it had no flavor except smoke which I'm guessing was liquid smoke. The collard greens side I ordered was so acidic and lacking the long cooking time that this dish needs. I think they might have tasted sour because they had gone bad? My in-laws split a two meat combo and I was embarrassed to take them there. A $70.00 tab for two sandwiches, a split entree plate, one mixed drink and three sodas? Oh, and we ordered a plate of happy hour nachos which were store bought round corn tortilla chips, congealed cheddar cheese, maybe a cup of diced tomatoes and black olives with lackluster sour cream and salsa on the side. Needless to say, we will never go back. I give this place 6 months tops. Whoever thinks this qualifies as good BBQ needs to go to read a recipe and attempt to cook BBQ for the first time ever. I'm almost positive it will come out better."
pZt98iouRg1-KnuX5KyxxA,3,"Wish there were different categories to rate:

Fish and chips were pretty good, flaky, needed a touch of salt and maybe pepper.

We ordered a flight, our understanding was it would be 5 tastes......only got 3-  had to send 2 of them back for dirty glasses,  

Waitress was seemingly upset we were there- probably the first customers if the day, guess we interferes with gossip time."

p2oQnE71Bzt3jygE8d9IVA,4,"Their curry chicken katsu is delish. If you get the mild curry you won't really get the full curry flavor, so my suggestion is to get the regular curry. It's not very spicy, it has just the right amount of kick. 

The Japanese gentleman who takes care of the front of the house is very nice and kind. 

Note: Call in advance if you're planning to pick up your order. If you use Eat 24 they might not receive your order since Eat 24 has to call them to verbally place your order even though you've placed your order through their app."

Her space in the salon is decorated so cute, and the entire experience from start to finish is extremely relaxing. She was very informative and explained to me in detail the different types of lashes so I can get an idea of what I wanted. As soon as she started I knew I was in great hands. It took about 2 hours for my full set but we talked the entire time, and I couldn't believe how fast it went by when she said we were done! I'm so obsessed with my lashes, I strongly recommend Le to anyone!!"
J2gpK-kECyRgnS1b3v2IGQ,2,We tried eat at Blazin bills today however the wait we had 45 minutes took an hour to wait a for our food to arrive. The place was so noisy and crowded. We ordered onion rings which were nice and served hoever very greasy. We all ordered ribs which was and nicely served and plenty of meat. After we ate it took the waitress another 40 minutes to give us our check never offer dessert or coffee. But the place is packed.the bathroom was a mess.upon leaving a lady at the register complaining that a take out order called in took another 40 minutes.
8mf7kk6XoFN5F90czSrhmA,3,"The food here is always fantastic...the counter people though are always borderline rude at least the times I've been there.  They've never been helpful with suggestions or answering questions.  This time there wasn't even ice, for the iced tea that had just been brewed and was very warm.  The food flavorwise was excellent though, I had a macaron and the chips with salsa and guacamole.  So I probably will keep avoiding here because I don't really want to bother the employees with doing their job."
YrnsxsmFZaQuOOq-DCphFQ,1,"My experience with both Belk corporate office and Belk customer service is not positive. Belk has the most trashy, ignorant, arrogant, slow, rude, stubborn and uninformed staff ever. I filed a complaint with the BBB online and it took 3 days for Belk to address my concerns. When I finally got a call from Belk they made the huge mistake to have the stupidest employee out of the whole company handle my issue of customer dissatisfaction. Not very smart on their part. You can hear it in the customer service representative's voice he did not want to call me in the first place and didn't want to deal with me because me he obviously was forced to call me. I didn't like his tone of voice so I brought it to his attention and he didn't like that. He then changed the subject back to my complaint and lied about calling a third party that allegedly handles blocked IP addresses and blocked payment. My BBB case just closed today and despite my complaint Belk still has not given me an apology nor settled in my favor by admitting their wrong in what they do especially that I the customer is right which they will never do."
F2JN-3dMmZ7VzFQh_8ll2w,1,"I hate to say this, but Luna has gone downhill. There are 2 reasons you come into this place - Mexican food and to watch events on TV.  For me, the events are usually NFL games.

First off, the quality of the food has decreased significantly.  If you want good Mexican food, there are plenty of places to get it.  Likewise, the service in the cantina is weak.  I came in on a weekday for lunch, and there were not many customers in the cantina.  Still took almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter over, then another 10 to get a soda I had ordered. The table behind me was empty and sat unbussed for the entire 20 minutes, but the busboys walked by several times. I have worked in restaurants and I would have fired them for what I saw...

Once I got the food, it was okay, but I had to wait another 20 minutes to get a waiter's attention to get my check...

Final straw for me was going in today to watch football. I got in early to see where my game was showing.  They have signs on the TVs indicating which games were showing on each TV. Sat so I could see Raiders/Titans and Jags/Ravens. I was told in no uncertain terms that the TVs were not changing, and heard the bartender mention that as well.  But, before the 1st quarter was out, the games changed... So I could not see the games I wanted to see.

Why come here?"
BR8bsVj4Q4W6DvNEJrckZg,5,One word..Amazing! This is my 2nd time and everything is so good! I took my bf here who originally hated crapes but now he's in love with this place.

The breakfast burro (add potatoes and chorizo)  is unbelievably delicious!!

egChkAehOCn3gBbUgFcZIg,4,"I started looking for a new car back in June. We took a test drive with Harry ""Good News"" Gosnell. Since then I've taken a lot of test drives and a lot of times the salesman talk all through the test drive and trying to point out stuff about the car. 

Harry sat in the back seat and took me on a drive that showed me how to make the most of the turning radius in the Subaru Impreza and how to get out of gravel without spinning the tires and how to backup using the backup camera and the trajectory angles to my advantage. I'm a nervous Nelly in the car and this guy gave me so much confidence about parking and doing three-point turns and accelerating. Since that test drive my overall driving proficiency has increased so much and my confidence. It was an added bonus that I did not expect.

There are six Subaru dealerships within a 20 Mi radius of my house. I talked to nearly all of them and drove a car at another Subaru dealership, a Kia dealership and a Mitsubishi dealership. 

Now in August we were just getting the funding together to make the purchase. I'd been to a lot of different dealerships including Kenny Ross (where I would never go again... check out their BBB rating) and and we came back and drove a Subaru Forester with Harry Gosnell.

The Forester was a bigger car and more suited to our family needs, but we felt that it was out of our price range. One of the managers, Garrett, gave us a deal that made it affordable for us. and this enabled us to get the premium with the heated seats and all of the bells and whistles that we could not afford before this deal.

We knew that we couldn't stay and make a deal that day and we had to leave the dealership and we were worried that they might pressure us to stay but they didn't.

We went home we talked about it and we decided to make a counter-offer to the dealership which we presented to them. They considered our offer and gave us a very good trade allowance on our car and a significant portion off of the price of the Forester that we bought, this deal brought both sides together and was more than acceptable to my husband and I.

When we came in to purchase the car they were able to take all of our information and schedule an appointment for us to meet with the finance person, Chris.

In the finance office Chris was very organized took all of our paperwork,  put it before us and explain each thing before we signed. He explain the various products that they sell in the finance office but never pressured us to buy anything. He told us that it was perfectly fine with him if we didn't pick up any of the extras at the end, all of which we skipped on. 

I am a spreadsheet and numbers person and all of the numbers added up and nothing extra was added. There were no dirty tricks. They cleaned up the car that we picked out and got it all ready for us while we were signing the paperwork.

I left there with a very positive feeling and a lot of thankfulness because I have been praying for a new car and it happened. God is good!"
rMQjBShDU3PmRCXULBxw1A,5,"This is my all time favorite place to eat!!!!!
My husband and i went here during one of our many trips to Vegas. 
From the outside it doesn't look like anything too special but that almost adds to its charm. 
You enter though a secret door like the old school mob movies. It has a very intimate feeling when you walk in. Seating is private and comfortable,Live music that was AMAZING.. walks up to the table to sing to you but not too much. So for me the atmosphere and service was already giving them major points in my book. 
Now the food ... WOWWWW We started with the meatballs as an appetizer,best meatballs I have ever had, and I even loved the red sauce it was in( i'm super picky because my family makes our own) The pasta we ordered tasted homemade and fresh, so  amazing. we each got a diff pasta and we both loved each.The pricing is great!!  service is top notch reminded me of eating at Mortins Steakhouse but a much for nostalgic experience. We had such a great time dining we didn't want to leave so moved over to the bar area where we continued to listed to songs we loved from our fav Frank Sinatra and others from that era. Since going the first time we have made this a MUSt stop on each of our other Vegas vacations we have taken and will continue to keep coming back."

I feel like Norm when I walk in b.c they all know my name and my drink however I like to get something different every now and then just to throw them of course b/c I'm sneaky sneaky like that. You get $.10 off if you bring in your own cup, free refills and syrups if you have a Starbucks card that you register online plus for every 15 drinks you get, you get a coupon in the mail for a free one. And not some free drip coffee--you can get ANYTHING! Hell yes I go venti quad shot white chocolate something something b/c I can and I've earned it.

The facilities and amenities are great, the equipment is high quality, but more so than that, the staff is AMAZING! They are friendly, knowledgeable and you can tell they value each customer and provide top notch service in doing so. In terms of rising, I love the format of the classes, the challenge of the riding, and the system they use to keep you on pace and challenged. Sometimes I get frustrated with spin bikes because the resistance seems inconsistent, but the resistance is real when it comes to their Torq system. And then in some classes they add some weights and holy cow you feel the burn! I love that there is measurable results too based on the info the bike records during your ride. Knowing the distance ridden, average speed, calories burned, etc. keeps the drive alive and making you want to come back for more. I'm keeping my fingers crossed they open more locations because the only downside for me is that it is a little bit of a drive. But I'm making the drive, so that says a lot right there! I highly recommend trying them out if you're looking for a new cardio workout or just want a challenge!"

I think we literally asked 10x for the edamame (as my 15 month old only eats that) and finally when we were done and ordered our ice cream and paid did they bring out the missing order. The food was meh, I know you can't expect much from AYCE but I' ve had better. The server even acknowledged that they were too busy and unprepared however when I mentioned the ""busyness"" of the night she said no it's always like this near the end of the week.

On our recent trip to LV, we stayed in Henderson, away from the hustle and bustle of the LV strip. Yelped a couple spots we wanted to check out for brunch and I am SO GLAD THAT WE MADE A STOP HERE AT SERVED. It wasn't packed when we arrived so we got seated right away. Our servers were exceptional. So friendly, so quick, and so personable. 

The establishment is small, hip, and very clean. Lots of parking and in a very nice neighborhood. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely be back there to try out the rest of the menu items. 

For this trip, I got the longanisa breakfast. Let me tell you... my belly was SO HAPPY. Something so simple, but was so delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the miso burger and he loved it. I look at the picture I took and I'm salivating over the thought of their food. You can be adventurous or a little more on the traditional side. Whatever floats your boat.

OI0eH0eVzU2YUflCwU5iBA,5,"How could I resist when my manfriend calls and asks, ""Hungry?"" Without a single thought, I blurted, ""Yes!"" He says, ""Am gonna take you to where the best New York pizza is!"" Uhm, there's that in this city? Am thinking, my my my he knows I heart NY pizza!?! How did he know? Hmmm, a man after my own heart! Yeaaay okay, he picks me up and off we go. Initially, he says to valet park the car and so I thought so we can get in to noshing pizza at once (with a smile to my face) but then the practical me says to him to just park the car in the self park area of the hotel because am thinking this keeps my hunger perked up some more into hunger-ness. It's just that I miss New York pizza. It's been sooo long ago, and so does he! We're both from the Eastcoast so there...New York pizza is a definite go-to food for us. New York pizza have always been the best pizza I ever tasted in this American part of the world. (I just have to dream about real Italian pizza until I set foot in Italy some day).

Sirrico's Pizza is in New York-New York hotel and casino. It serves mighty big slices in that good ol' triangle shape or square shape pizza cuts. It's fresh and hot hot from the oven! A variety of pizza choices. Didn't even shy me from asking for the newest made pizza and the biggest of the slices. Pizza grande!

Like a ""starved"" woman, I was aching for this pizza. Looking at the slices of Sirrico's Pizza from the big wide glass-encased food service counter, the pizza man served my boyfriend first and then me. He served us with politeness to even ask which pizza we wanted. Of course, I asked for the ones fresh out of the oven as he pulls out from the oven a new hot tray of pizza and layed it down in front of us. A side order of garlic bread with tomato sauce also was requested by my man friend. Service was polite, fast and with ease. There was no line or wait as we breezed through with the pizza and beverages into the paying process. I spotted the usual toppings of hot dried red peppers, garlic, oregano along the way to the cashier. Asked my boyfriend whether he likes garlic and not repulsed by the smell of it. He says he likes garlic, oh my! Then so, I got a hold of the oregano, hot red dried pepper, garlic containers and drizzled 'em on my pizza! These, are my usual fixings to the New York pizza for as long as I eat New York pizza ever since. I usually ignore the cheese topping. There's cheese enough in the pizza. Why ever top it with another kind of cheese?  the parmesan cheese. 

Dear boyfriend found a nice round table to seat outside of the pizzeria. It's dining ala outdoors-y from the pizzeria which includes people-watching and strains of music from somewhere the piano bar next to the pizzeria can be heard. I have to say for the cost it took to have 'em, this did not faze either one of us from having two picks of pizza slices each: a slice of ooey-gooey cheesey large cuts of pepperoni pizza and a slice of vegetarian pizza topped with large cuts of onions, olives, mushrooms and green peppers. The pizza had just the right amount of cheeze-iness, tasty tomato sauce, and it appeared moist with oil clearly visible but it lack the desired crunchiness on the dough for it was thick! Oh pleased...gusto, mangia mangia pizza pizza! (eat pizza) Mangiare pizza grande! (eat big pizza!) Aaah, hearty dining! It's my man's treat of a simple meal but mightily appreciated, as it brings a smile to my tummy and memories of our eastcoast lives and New York! To some this may not be the best pizza in this city but sure is to our New York pizza memory. Hungry for pizza? You, am talking to you! Go munch on a pizza yumm pizza!"

The chicken pesto pizza is my favorite, but I really enjoy there spinach salad as well. The tables are a bit small if you are in a group, but they do a good job of timing the arrival of the food so that they can fit it on the table. This means sharing makes it easier, which I don't mind at all as I like trying a piece of every pizza."

zeaVB_H9a93Dbw65OtOEQA,3,"It was a change from the norm. Didnt think 4 3oz meatballs was worth $20. Not saying that the meal wasn't good, its just that its Pittsburgh, not DUMBO."
_Fur7WJ_p2q2YxvawEf-qw,4,"The food is really good. The kubba was decent, but I'm not a big fan of kubba. We got a mix platter with kabob, chicken, lamb, and beef liver tikka, and some Iraqi shawarma. The whole platter which feeds 4 easily was 45$ so pricing was good. The lamb tikka was very tender and extremely tasty. Only reason this isn't a 4 or 5 star is because the restaurant isn't very nice to look at. I went with my parents, my father being Iraqi, and according to him it has a very authentic Iraqi feel like any bar from back home, and the food was authentic too. The feel might bring feelings of home and feel familiar to some but in my opinion the restaurant could use a major uplift. However if you're looking for some good food I definitely recommend it."
xcLRIUC-LTOx0xrulddX4Q,5,"I went in for a smog check and was in and out within 15 min. They were quick, efficient, super friendly and affordable! Definitely will be back!"
RirREP5ceK3hmzr99AmIxQ,2,"I'm giving this 2 stars because the back of the house knows how to cook.

However, the front of the house has failed us twice and I give them zero stars.  On our first visit, we had a reservation and still had to wait.  They were overwhelmed and my girlfriend and I are understanding of dinner rushes so we didn't have a problem with it.  The food was delicious on our first visit and we just chalked it up as a one-off where it was just one of those busy rushes.

Fast forward to last Friday, 3/20, and we were seated and unable to even get a drink or bread.  This time, the restaurant wasn't even full.  After 20 minutes, I said to the hostess that I believe our waiter forgot about us.  She replied that he was double-sat tables.  The tables were outside and we were inside which could make her at fault which having a server have to run around an entire restaurant is incredibly inefficient.  As a former bartender/server, I understand how cumbersome this can be.  However, the hostess stating that he was double-sat tables essentially tells us that we are the least important of his tables.  She did politely take our drink order and after a total of 25 minutes, with only water at our table, we couldn't take it anymore and left. 

Since this is the second time this has happened, it's clear that the owners/managers are at fault for being too cheap to hire additional servers. Or, they're hiring servers that are inept at handling any sort of volume.  

In conclusion, the back of the house here rocks!  It's a shame that the front of the house is sinking the ship.  We've given them two times to get it together and they have failed us each time.  

GET YOUR FRONT OF THE HOUSE TOGETHER IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN BUSINESS!!"
gAmW2R5UyGxta-cZHQyW1A,1,I'm very disappointed We came here 3 years ago spent 500 dollars had the time of our lives we decided to try them again made our reservations very excited for our New Years plans. We ended up sick as a Dog Throwing up ETC on our New Years Eve Party ended the night sick as a dog in our room ruined our New Years Eve. Went to talk to the manger the next day instead of helping us sent us to security ( WHY ) made me feel like he didn't believe us we had to fill out a bunch of paperwork and no answers from management Do Not Go here there are a lot of places in LV enjoy elsewhere
BuJDoBLEOSJuHT9pA6-vCg,2,"Rude front desk staff.  Beds were hard as rocks. Woke up with a terrible back ache.  Their check in is too late(4pm).  Staff refused early check in or late check out despite having availability(half empty parking lot).  
Please be aware this is a timeshare and staff will push for you to buy a timeshare.  
Positives: Room was clean and pool was nice."
pZkx3WsVkIyEyfoostPtkA,5,"Another great review for this Auto Zone!  Went for new windshield wipers and the guy 100% helped me before I even got in the store.  Great staff, great service!"
D4njNPzGyQMlYYB7gUbgnA,5,"I really liked this place! I went there on a weekday evening when there was no one else in there, so I can't speak for weekends. The atmosphere was awesome and had that classic downtown Phoenix vibe in an old converted house, though it was a bit confusing on where to go when I first walked in. The owner and other employees were very nice as well. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried guacamole (on happy hour) and the red potato and gazpacho burger with the brown sugar lemonade. Everything was delicious, including the fries, the house made ketchup, and the other amazing house made sauces. Reasonably priced for fresh, delicious vegan/vegetarian food, and it looked like they had great coffee drinks although we didn't try any. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!"
1K7q3aEM51VSNn--iVYXtw,1,"I tried to search these guys before using them on yelp as their website reads nonstoplockand key.com
It's a complete bait and switch saying its a $15 call out fee and then $35 for the work they use a different name for yelp and their receipts which is 24-7 lock smith .
They pop up as a Google ad pay per click , when I called I asked a few times making sure it was the correct price I had a bad feeling from start as it was hard to get a straight answer.
I refused to pay the whole amount and sent them on their way I'm interested in how many times a day the lock technician must have to go through this."
Y3fIFDjLMg0JB1jNd6w8kg,3,"So this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. Let me start out by saying this is my 3rd Emeril's restaurant in Vegas. The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. 
The service and customer service here is exceptional. 

We tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake. 
Most of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again. 
The filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. 

When asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work."
JkwmarcfFhmiGLCaztccfg,4,"Popped in here for lunch this week with a coworker and was quite pleased with the overall experience. They have both a small lunch menu (which still has tons of options) and a bigger menu for all the time that had too many options for a quick lunch. 

We both went with Bento boxes and were impressed with the tasty food and quick service. The glass noodles were delicious and the California rolls tasty. The teriyaki chicken was dark meat rather than white. It was just full of flavour.

We were very pleased with the overall experience and if we're in the area again, I think I'd push to go back."
oKFtjYFcctVPWXs0RCOUPg,4,"My 8 friends and I came here for dumplings, and even though we only stopped for dumplings (I was holding a mini food tour), they quickly set-up a table for all of us in the back. We ordered the pork and chive dumplings fried, and the shrimp and vegetable dumplings boiled (apparently they don't steam them). I expected to hate the boiled dumplings but we actually really enjoyed them. Some people even said that they preferred them over the fried dumplings. That's a first for me! The service was great, and we received our food quickly. I plan to return and try some of their other menu options. They have quite a large menu, and the Schezuan section appealed to several people in my group."
oUH2nrzdeYVDIncBnKkXAQ,5,"JR did an amazing job doing the tint on our Mitsubishi Evolution. He took the time to explain different tint options and recommend what he thought would be best. He was prompt and professional, we will definitely use him for any future tint needs!"
_VW16WFqe2IBnGIvPQYHUw,3,"Nothing surprising about this Green Grotto location. Looks and feels like the other locations.

Just popped into here to pick up some bubble tea on the way to visit some friends.

It wasn't busy at all and service that day was a little slow is getting our order of four drinks out the door.

The drinks were what you expect from this place. Done well enough and by the book. Solid."
42h4oQiFU2_NwwyfXy8pFQ,2,"My wife and I attended. We were looking forward to it so much.   It was a nice day,  nice weather so at $50.00 for both of us,  we were okay - but just barely okay. A few suggestions for the event leaders: 1. Get a larger venue. The closeness of the crowd was very offsetting! 2. In addition to the marvelous local vegan restaurateurs, also approach national brands (Follow Your Heart, tofurky, Daiya, Morningstar, tuscon tamales, &c.) and have them attend.  3. Work out something different for people who pre-paid vs. those who need to purchase tickets at the event.  People with vip tickets were waiting in long lines with people who had not pre paid. I heard a lot a groaning about that.  4. Only offer vip tickets online.  As we were leaving after a couple of hours of standing because there was not enough seating,  my wife said ""Let's not go next year. That was terrible and expensive. Definitely not worth it!"" To which I replid: ""This is only the 2nd year.  People will give them improvement ideas and next year will be better. We'll go one more year. ""  PLEASE don't make a liar out of me. Learn!  You raked in cash at this event, but I won't pay that kind of money for the kind of experience you provided this year and I'll be looking very closely at everything next year before plunking down 50 to 100 bucks just to get in,  then paying for food and whatnot."
T3fI8Ij3qzLE122xsHMB5w,5,This place is super cool!!  I love the positive vibe and great food plus they have beers on tap!!!
2kVIxSPTcJ37e3irWNV05Q,3,"Waitress gives you wrong food then says you ordered wrong. Cool. Thanks Perkins for the horrible over priced meal I didn't order. I got some weird dish with hash browns in my pancakes and scrambled eggs. I despise scrambled eggs (the army ruined them) and these looked just like army scrambled eggs. They didn't look fresh at all and I know I would never order them. 


Update::: she heard me telling my friend when we got the bills and walks back to tell me I'm wrong, that what she wrote down is right. Even though I have never ordered scrambled eggs once in my life and everything on the plate was wrong. 

I have never been treated so rudely by a server. I work in the industry so I get it. It can be a shitty job but if something is clearly wrong I fix it instead of being rude, condescending and mean."
ItSS722u2glIUmc_bPxGPg,4,"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list. 
We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. 
Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side."

Great scones too!"
GN7duB7o784Wo3CzssNLmA,4,"After thinking about it for what seems like years, I finally bought my first DSLR here. The person assisting me was very nice, knowledgeable, and did not try to upsell me anything. He even recommended a reasonable alternative to the sdcard I had picked that saved me a few dollars.

I bought the camera during a promotion, making it pretty much the same price as on the internet, with the added benefit that I feel that I have a shop to go to in case I have problems."
pMKHhnmPj35NlYpjoHJbqA,3,"I am super disappointed with most of my experiences here. This is the closest location to my home but 6/10 times I get followed by security or encounter huge piles of anything and everything everywhere. I have nothing to hide, and I do not appreciate being followed while I'm trying to pick new things out for my home. I'm indecisive, and may or may not put things back in different areas because I always have a budget that I can't stay under. I never bring in my purse anymore just to avoid someone walking 2 feet behind me asking if I'm doing okay. Target is my go to place when feeling down or whenever I need anything. I'd rather go to the target that's 15 minutes away than go to this location now. 


I hope that others have better experiences here, because target is up there with Disneyland - such a happy place."

X5f5EADYTVjQikt8QXVGrg,1,"I wanted to write this sooner in your guest survey but since I have a very hectic work schedule and you only allow 4 days to put in the survey, I now must use this. I feel that this was the worst visit I've ever experienced at any of your Chili's locations in my life. I'm 23 years old and work very hard for the money I get, on top of going to college full time for further my career and live on my own. For me to go out to dinner, it's rare but since I used to work in the restaurant industry, I expect good service and understand what is required from a server. The service I received at the West Mifflin Chili's was horrible. The hostess seemed annoyed that we were coming in TWO hours before closing. I requested a booth, she gave me an attitude and said ""fine."" No smile, no professionalism, and no manners. I then get seated where there's only one other two top seated, didnt get greeted for 7 minutes after being sat. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food that had been clearly sitting under the heat light for atleast 10 minutes in the kitchen. He did not come back once to check on us after getting the food. His name is Geo. Worst service ever. Horrible server that did not care."
8N-DixzdO07X7eeet2-Cag,4,"I haven't had their food yet, but their wine and beer selection is one of the best in Charlotte. THere is a nice little seating area, and a bar area where you can order beer and wine.  They always have some good beer on tap and you can order a half pint.  The beer selection is well organized.  From normal craft stuff in the cooler to a selection dedicated to Belgians and sours.  Def check it out if you are in the area."
fllgqQr7cFkuppWLlXbbbw,1,"We dined here for breakfast and ordered the Halla bread French toast, eggs Benedict and a simple bacon/eggs breakfast. The prices are high for the quality and portions you receive. The coffee is gross and the service is mediocre. I am unimpressed and would much rather spend my money at Le Peep in the arboretum, any Cracker Barrel or even Waffle House."

6OV9HfNaYDB1UCBEbfgb_g,4,"I called Sarah inquiring about repairing the battery port on my Samsung GS5. She was completely honest with me and warned me that it's possible that the screen would crack. She would need to have one on hand in case that happened.
I decided to have the screen replaced anyway, what I thought was a scratch was actually a giant crack. 
That worked out well! She gave me am amazing deal because I was replacing both parts.
She called me when the part was in, even gave me an after hours number to reach her. 
I dropped it off, had my phone back in less than an hour. 
A week later I thought I was having problems with my microphone,  turns out it was my face. Yeah, little embarrassing.  She was so kind, so nice and patient.  She can have an office full of people and is very patient and generous with her time but completely efficient. 
So happy to have found her!

Oh! She also told me how to charge my battery without it being in my phone. She really does care!"
9yZrYE54-plthSONeiMdOg,5,Was in town on business. Found this class and headed over.  It is clean and the staff was helpful.  The class was hard and a great workout. They had towels and all the stuff you would expect. I gave it 5 stars because it was clean the people were nice they had lockers and a place to change and it was a killer workout. What else do u need!  Kudos to Jess the coach that night. She runs a fast pace class so get ready to rock.
Xy4D0oqNrbHfX0c_mHtmYA,5,"I didnt have a perfect experience with my windshield, but the customer service and friendly staff at SW Auto glass is why I will be a return customer as well as refer friends! I had a small pinhole leak that made a whistle noise in my BMW after the windshield was replaced (to be fair, 95% of cars it likely wouldnt have been noticeable, however since my car is silent inside, the slightest of noises can be heard!) I sent an email (didnt call as it was after hours) and had the installer on the phone within 10 minutes of the email! I typically expect a warranty issue to take days or longer (using the larger companies it takes an act of congress to get something fixed, about 10 years ago my corvette had a leak and it took 11 days to get that company back out to fix it and STILL had to fight with them as they insisted it was leaking somewhere else!) but in this case, even with christmas being the next day, they were out the day after christmas and came to my work to fix it. Customer service isnt easy to come by like this, and id rather deal with a small issue and have them own up to it and fix it than a big company that puts me off and treats me as another notch on the belt. 
The team at SW Auto glass is great!"
JV8ftur7ytbXn2l174DBjQ,1,This casino and other MGM Affiliated Casinos charges $10 to park in the garage even if you're a local. Will never come here again. I'm spending my money in this establishment and they can't even offer free parking.  Never Again MGM!
L328Mqwg0R8wxcR9pM3twA,3,"It's good but I'm not overly impressed. I think this place got more hype than it needed. But the food has tasted good every time Ive gone (not great). And service has been ok but not great. Nothing wrong with this chain, just not quite worth the hype in my opinion!"

nDdwRP5HZj6Ufm6UMPXnug,4,"1700+ reviews and maintaining a 4.5 star!? I just had to check out what the fuss is about. So this past weekend I got to visit Vegas for my birthday, and decided to pay oyster bar a visit. I knew the line was gonna be long so I specifically chose to come here early on Monday morning, I'm talking about 4 am type of early!
I walked in expecting to get seated right away and boy was I in for a surprise..... there was a line! Mind you it was 4am on a Monday, so I was completely in shock; ended up waiting for almost an hour to get seated!
Not gonna lie I was getting pretty frustrated with the wait so I had high expectations when it came to the food. I decided to order the combo pan roast with a spice level of 7 out of 10 and the three shooter special with vodka ($12). The shooters had quite a bit of vodka and nice chunk of oyster as well and the pan roast definitely lived up to the hype. The only problem I had with the pan roast was their use of previously frozen seafood but the flavor definitely makes up for this minor issue.

Overall verdict, oyster bar is definitely worth the wait. I just hope they can expand the place in the near future or hire another staff to offset the wait time a bit."
cHHW5c_HI4fN0_LzWOO0BQ,5,"Arti was fabulous and his designs spoke to my flair for bright colors and soft flowing feminine fabrics.  I'm a student of Dance and I was elated to see so many clothes that accentuate the artful gracefulness of movement. To top it off, the music playing softly in the background titillated my senses for the beautiful art of dance and everything beautiful.  

It was a beautiful experience meeting Arti and shopping at Vasari!!!!"
ilNX2NDbBSbMj3Vv5DaDaA,4,"The gf and I hit the Galaxy Theatre on what turned out to be their opening night.  Watched, ""Oz The Great and Powerful "" - 3D.  We were fired up about the notion of ""luxury"" seating since my daughter recently shared an experience at a similar theatre in southern california so we were hoping for the same.  Not quite but we still enjoyed the place.

Highlights:

- Like the fact that you can order and reserve the seat in advance ( but there is a $2 processing fee ) - movie cost $14/person. 

- The seats are very comfortable with electronic control to recline the chairs.  BIg surprise, the seat  is very comfortable.

- sound system is awesome.

- screen is HUGE

- I like that they require you to completely turn off the cell phones

Lowlights:

- wish they had ""loveseat"" style seating - it was kinda hard to get comfy with my girl

- Although the screen is huge, they should cut a few feet off the bottom.  Anytime someone stood up in the first few rows, their melons blocked a portion of the screen.

- expected full food service in the theatre

We'll return 

one pic from seat"
x6q6c11lmExCPcpKx-FR1w,4,The food is very good at this upscale old-favorite Phoenix eatery. I like the traditional-old-school-rat-pack vibe.
kqvTCKcWJbiZzmtyW9io-Q,3,Heard much about this Thomas Keller place in Vegas. Price is surprisingly acceptable for a fancy restaurant like this one. I only went there for breakfast and had the Croque Madame which is basically like an Eggs Benedict with Toast instead of Muffin. It is however one of the best I have ever had when it comes to an Egg and Ham sandwich. The toast was grilled to perfection which adds to the overall texture and taste. I would come back and try for a dinner item for sure!!!
FATJBmT-579Xl__U1mK7kA,5,I will say that they do follow through when I do ask for my french fries to be cooked fresh Lee and lightly salted. Employees do work together is a great team. I do recommend this establishment to anyone all over the valley
RnLnhcEH9SgomGrAiQIJSg,2,"3 stars based on a decent cashew nut chicken dish.  The decor is old, really needs a revamp.  Its one of those places it's probably best not to see the kitchen (less than clean interior).
Needs some paint, lose the gross carpet."
Sm7H3B-_7n0pT0J2tI4HOw,5,"Staying here at Aria right now and it is so elegant the moment you step into their lobby. Unlike what other people said about a long line on checking in, I only waited about 2 minutes before a friendly staff directed me to a check in counter. I am so glad they have the early check in option and my room was ready at 9 am! 

I got the standard room on the 8th floor and I am already impressed - I will book higher rooms next time. Almost everything in the room - the drapes, lights, temperature, setting up a wake up call or even setting a room to private (no need to hang a do not disturb sign!) can be controlled with a button either on the tv, by the wall or that tablet by the bedside table. 

Overall I am impressed by this hotel and will come back."
qab6GDoNC0jUjq97d3kPDQ,3,"They have changed their menu since the last time we were here. Not for the better in my opinion. No more brisket . Now they're just like every other restaurant on the strip. What we ordered was good, especially the Mac n Cheese, but we will try someplace else the next time we are at T-Mobile."
0azVMaJ1blwi7PPjdI9t-A,4,"We went on Sunday night at 7pm. It was cutely lighted up and people were still there even though they close at 9pm. 

Adults pay $5 and children pay $10. Children pay more because they get stickers and they also get to pick a pumpkin from the pumpkins that are out in the play area. There is a hay ride, a mini maze, plenty of photo ops, a lot of animals to look at, and a mini rodeo for the kids. 

They have tables to be able to sit and decorate the childrens pumpkins and they also sell snacks and drinks. There are also two jump houses and plenty of shade with tables. 

There is a bigger pumpkin patch as well, where you can purchase more pumpkins. They have cute home decor for sell as you walk in as well.

Definitely worth visiting!"

Everything is good."
PK1mM68Vt75g3aJ40FwNHg,1,"Yes, prices are cheap but you get what you pay for. Absolute worst dry cleaner I've ever used. Picked up a few items to find holes in one item and stains that looked like burns on ALL items. I went back to ask about this and was told ""those holes are from the identifier tags"" and ""that doesn't look like a burn, it's probably grease or something from the machines"". OK... No apology or anything but they offered to reclean for free and against my better judgement, I let them. Everything came back with the same stains, just faded and even more holes. They offered to reclean again but this time I refused. 

I should have known, always take a test item to a new dry cleaner first! My mistake. Now I've got 3 expensive items with stains, holes and faded leather."
3M9_FBpMdqxee-9GDaM6qw,1,"I could not believe what I paid for this nasty food. 
1. The lady charged me for side meat I added to my shrimp won ton before asking me if it was ok. No. It was not okay. It was $8 for .22 lbs. plus 9$ for my won ton. Wft. I have never paid this much for won ton of any taste level, not in San Francisco not in Portland Oregon not in San Diego. Overpriced and tastes bad. 
2. Yes. The taste, it was too salty.  From the soup to the tripe to the beef tendon, all salty. I didn't finish the side dishes bc it couldn't stand how salty it was. 
3.  Size does matter when you're paying over 16$ for a won ton dish. The bowl was 6 inches in diameter and about 4 inches deep. Very small. The pic shows the size. 
4. The service was mediocre and the place was so ordinary. Why did I pay so much? I don't understand why this place has 4 stars. Seriously.  I mean 16$ for .5 lbs of tripe. Not one lb. half a lb only. That's 32$ for one lb. yikes. Misleading and very disappointed with this business."
a0M0m2jtNpHPwLoJKZvr9g,5,"The NY style pizza here was as good or better than any I've had in New York!  The Greek Salad was fresh and delicious.  Another place I'd like to re-visit before our vacation is over.  Two tables in the dining room, all other customers were picking up to-go orders and most were picking up items other than pizza.  Extensive menu. Really enjoyed visiting with Vinny.  Highly recommend!!"
64mI0Y3SHNvnrkRGld2zNQ,1,"In a word, this place sucks. I usually stick to WingStop just because it's familiar territory, but decided to venture outside of my comfort zone. Trust me people, change is not good because B.Dubbs was a huge letdown. 

We walk in and are waiting for about ten minutes before a host says, ""Oh, are you dining in?"" There was no one ahead of us and the restaurant was not busy, how did she not see us? We get seated and take a look at the menu. Another ten minutes pass before we see a server. She was really sweet but seemed new. She asks me if I want a dry rub on my wings. She explained it as they put dry rub on them before putting sauce on so I said sure. They came out with dry rub on them and nothing else, no sauce. Just covered in seasoning and fried, then covered with more seasoning. Pretty gross and unappetizing. 

We don't see her for quite a while. Our glasses are empty, one of my friends needs ranch, and our server is nowhere to be found. My boyfriend flags someone down, who ignores us. He gets our waiter who brings refills and ranch. She brought me the wrong drink, a Dr. Pepper instead of root beer. 

All in all, this place was pretty bad for a wing place. The service sucks, the wings are gross, the staff looks like they want to shoot themselves, it was not a fun dinner. Also, the music is way too loud! We were practically yelling at each other the whole night. WingStop is definitely not something to brag about, but I'd rather go there than this place."
t9vqH88fmPOzxFg9satLkQ,3,"Great location and outdoor eating was nice with live music in the square and a mister. The business model is excellent. You bring your order to the counter, get your own beverages, find your own seat and they use metal tray with parchment so not a lot of dishes to wash. The environment is hip and brings a good vibe to the place without them having to do anything but be there. You would think they could get the rest of what they do right. 

1. I chose my drink and brought it and my order to the front. The young man asked if we knew what we'd like . I said yes and asked a question about a menu item I did not see in the menu that had been recommended.  I looked up and he was gone however.  He returned and... did the same thing again.  Only this time,he took the beer bottle out of my hbd first and set it behind the register. We were baffled.  So rude and inconsiderate to just walk away both times.  We weren't dallying.  There was a line forming. Finally a girl took our order, rang us up and asked about drinks.  I pointed to my beer and Houdini reappeared and said, ""oh, is that yours, it was just sitting there, I was like who's is that? 
(!?  Really !?  Nothing like putting an exclamation point on our perceived invisibility.  He took it from in front of my hand) 

2. We sat and received a piece of cheesecake and one entree.  I flagged down a runner, then another to ask if they knew we still had a salad coming.  They brought me a salad, lay it in front of me and I asked if it was the melon salad.  I was told it was Caesar ?!  He took it and ran around the restaurant a few more times with it.  Five minutes later another runner said are you waiting on a salad? And laid down the very same salad in front of me.  I don't know whose it was but it visited several tables b4 u got it.  I told them I was waiting on the melon salad. He beer was gone, my friend had eaten his meal, the cheesecake was melting and covered in flies. Finally, after another 10 minutes went by and the cheesecake was inedible. I received my salad.
3. This was not a good salad. I don't know if they rushed it.  I don't know how many people had touched or become acquainted with it, or if it had originally had some feta or flavor that someone ate.  It was watermelon, tomato and cucumber with fresh ( but not at all flavor-filled) oregano and a sprinkle of feta with a weak balsamic on top.  The predominant flavor was cucumber.  Is that even a flavor? .  It looked pretty though.  It came with a mass of gyro meat.  That was tasty. 

All in all, it was a good meal because the environment and the company. It could have bee

Update: adding insult to injury - owner offers to remake the bland salad but says nothing of the way we were ignored and treated as if we didn't matter or exist three times by his first line employee, nor the delivery If food plates rotating between tables before being served to proper customers .  Those are your big issues."
7cWL8Xadq1u20nGAKRyOrA,1,"I would give 0/5 if I can. We ordered lamb curry, naan, and garden salad. A small bowl of lamb curry is 15 bucks. Garden salad did not come with cucumber, lettuce, and yogurt sauce as listed on the menu until we asked. They made garlic naan which is more expensive and we had to pay for them. No cashier at all. The funniest part is that we were asked to checkout by ourselves (operating the tablet for checkout and POS machine)."
drJbyr-aJTT0l0vcczLGXg,3,"Food is actually pretty good and adjustments can be made easily according to our choice. Biryani is really good. Something's are pretty oily. Ordered their eggless cake once it was amazing. Sweets are good too. Service as such is quite slow. No place to sit it's too small. It's better to just takeaway, but it not possible all the time."
WeB8C8C9OPbU6RxWUwRWzQ,4,"As a semi-professional musician and have been trained for 80% of my life for music, I can say that the Cleveland Orchestra IS indeed on top of my ranking list. I have also lived in Chicago for a few years and I couldnt really tell a BIG difference between the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra. 

I think given the location, it is very impressive that this orchestra is so successful right now. The music hall is just breathtakingly beautiful. I have been to 10+ concerts so far and there was no single concert that has let me down. One time, they had a jazz music event, called martini or something. It was one of the greatest experiences that I had with the fusion of classical and jazz music. Multiple music stars like Yoyo Ma and Joshua Bell have come to cleveland for performance as well. The players do rotate from time to time and yes minor errors are unavoidable but they are very minimal that I would not really frown on that.

If you are a student, they have a student fan card, which you can get for only $50 for a whole year's concert, except special events. If you catch the sale season, which is usually the first month of September or something, you only need to pay $25 for the same card. You do need to go get the student ticket at least 1 hour before the concert. I usually go a day or two before the concert.

Parking is a pain in the butt. The garage parking used to be $10 and now it's $11. Street parking is almost never available, unless you are willing to park somewhere that's 10 min away or get there 2 hours early."
zwH-ICPi8xjmhNkN4EdXuA,5,"One word... AMAZING!! Michele was great from the beginning. We just wanted something small and intimate and OUTSIDE... the first few venues I called were crazy expensive if I even wanted to fathom having it outdoors and not in some funeral home style room (one was bad but I'll keep this about AWH) Michele gave us a great price and everything we had wanted and saw for our wedding. The venue is absolutely beautiful... our photographer loved it's historic feel and it's hidden beauty in the less obvious places (pics are stunning) Our family had a great time, weather was nice and I didn't trip down the aisle on my heels!! It really was a great beginning to our life together and I thank Michele and the Antique wedding house for there huge role in that! 

I highly recommend them to anyone looking for an amazing wedding experience that won't immediately put you and your new partner in debt."
LRpHXdMOSGcUw5EVtNABdA,5,"I absolutely love this place. My partner has been tattooed by Jessi (her work is phenomenal) and I was there last week and got my hair cut by Julia (only $55 for a women's cut!!). The entire staff is welcoming and friendly and just really cool. I love that it's very much a creative space - they also have a small collection of vintage clothing and shoes for sale. The shop decor is super unique, the space is comfortable and the experiences there are overall really, really pleasant. Highly recommended!"

The thing that would get me to raise the review to 4 stars would be if they moved the store closer to where I live."
dHn_XQz4yx4rrnuPT2IZQw,5,Awesome atmosphere. I love the decore. The food is always great and spot on with taste and presentation. The staff are friendly and fun and the fact that they  all are of Irish descent  adds to the overall experience.
0RpAlFwdUvmwiXtPznEvvA,1,Service was horrible and way overpriced. Better off saving your money and eating Chef Boyardee !
S87fPNbcdd3L8TgBSgF_QQ,2,"Went here for Winterlicious at America Restaurant with my girlfriend. It is an Oliver and Bonacini restaurant, so i expected top quality - they definitely charge top dollar.  Not so.  Canoe costs about the same and is lightyears ahead in quality.

I had the beef sirloin and shortrib - very ordinary, none of the amazing flavours like at Canoe. Sirloin was undercooked by two levels.   Squash soup was good, but nothing mind blowing. 

My girlfriend's turkey salad was average. The turkey had an old and stale aftertaste.  Def not what i expected from Oliver & Bonacini.  Her lamb was good, but again, nothing extraordinary like in Canoe.   Definitely not worth even the Winterlicious price, let alone the a la carte.

All beers start at $10.  Ordinary brands.  Glasses of wine start at $14.  Ordinary wines. 

For Trump haters - no worries, this place only rents the brand, it's not owned by him, and heard that it will be changing the name soon."

pBtoIz5jKe_gCyoGrAVsuQ,4,"Beautiful restaurant with probably the best customer service I've experienced at a restaurant. Ordered the cheese bread for my appetizer and it was really good. My dining companion had the lobster for his appetizer and he enjoyed it. For the main course I chose the Parmesan encrusted chicken with potato cakes and cheddar grits as a side. While the chicken was cooked perfectly I didn't like the flavors so I sent it back and got the beef short rib which was good. The potato cakes were also good, but the cheddar grits were bland and needed salt. Overall the food was pretty good but the customer service was impeccable."
gF6sKauZiKq7V5uYL5kfxw,5,"First of all, before you buy that Groupon or Living Social, CALL the High Roller and check the price. I've been 5 times. The first time I was chuffed because I had a Groupon, but when we got there, I was stunned to discover the ""locals price"" was less than what I paid!. And just between you and me (do not tell anyone else!) Tuesday is half-price for locals. Yep, Two for the price of one. AND you can take your outta-town friends on your locals price -- one local ID can buy 4 tickets. Check it out !! 

That being said -- it is a fun thing to do and NOT scary. Do not be afraid to do this. I am terrified of heights -- chickened out of the zip line at the Rio, but this is not a ""ferris wheel."" It is a spacious enclosed cabin that moves so slowly that you don't feel it at all. 

One time we did the half-hour-happy hour and the Groupon was good for that because even though we are not big drinkers, we managed to slug back 3 drinks each, so that was a good deal. The bartender was delightful and told us all kinds of inside info on the wheel -- like for instance, what happens if someone has a heart attack or gets seriously ill? How fast can they whip this puppy around in an emergency?

One time, just by chance, we got there at dusk -- paid the daytime price, but got to see the sun set over the mountains. Beautiful. I've been there at night and also in the day time. It's lovely every time. 

This really is a Las Vegas treasure. Treat yourself. 

OH -- and wait -- after you get off, walk back toward the parking area and there is a big machine where you can take your own picture and post it right to Facebook. Check it out!"

She not only took the time to explain what type of lash she was going to put on my eyes, she was able to answer whatever questions I had. I can honestly say she does the best job out of anyone I've ever went to and my lashes stay on for up to 3 weeks. I highly recommend going to Linda at Whiplashes, you won't be disappointed!"
gh6Vh7YU1bqyGh20cVCuQA,1,"We just ordered two bowls for lunch from foodora and the portion sizes had our mouths drop. $14 for a 1/2 a small box full of food. The rice was barely 3 spoonfuls and I could count the amount of chickpeas on my hands. I guess I should have known better with the hipster thing they are pushing but this even exceeded my worst expectations. I had to add my own food to the bowl and offer it up to my friend who ordered from there as well. On top of that, there was no seasoning or dressing or flavour, just a dash of tiny portions in a clichéd cardboard box. I won't be going back and we have informed all of our colleagues in the office to not even attempt to consider Spark. This kind of poseur overpriced food ideology needs to be stamped out."
3NKAa-TMt2H7o0oBk3RHMw,1,I would rate it zero if that was an option. Complete ripoff. Don't use it. Force you to pay for insurance unless you bring your insurance card. Ridiculous security deposit held on cards. Staff are unfriendly and could not care any less about the service. Total joke. Pay more and get quality

Mps7wH7kjLYw6B7PmvlW2A,5,Awesome experience. First time there. Thank goodness they supply wine with dinner to soak up the great food. The left overs the next day were still good. This will be a must do on future visits.
BPsMF-5kNVpepC3b2gWIww,4,"Cruising back from SkiDagmar and enroute to Toronto we decided we were hungry - like right now.  Not knowing the area very well I could faintly recall a restaurant in roughly the same area that I had dined at several years ago. I had forgotten that I had yelped about it!  It was early in the week, very quiet due to several holidays, so we were lucky to have an empty table waiting for us. Food was still honest, fair priced and Sal took time to come over to say hello. Funny how life can repeat itself. The wood burning oven is great for the pizzas; the seafood dish that my partner had looked amazing (and yes I tasted it and would recommend it), our side of mashed potatoes were made from fresh potatoes not some package. And due to renovations it was clean, fresh with good signage outside."
NDxVvhQcUzchPqQdOspWvg,3,"Hmm where to start? 
I really like the hotel/casino but can't stand the walk back and forth to the Wynn for additional/better food options. 
The rooms are okay nothing special compared to other decent rooms on the strip (like even at Trump). A few things annoyingly stuck out - the towels were horrible and the TV in the bathroom did not belong hidden behind a frame that didn't fit. Other than that the service was really good - I didn't know that these hotels have something like a 15 minute window to fulfill various room requests. I had view of the strip which was really nice as well."
fjcRjC6dgKs907Ozg9y1lg,1,Tried this place because of the great reviews... very disappointed. The only good thing was the slaw. I will not be back. We tried 4 of the tacos and none were great.
3XAyOQ7vvyBU0nKlwIR2yA,5,"This is definitely the best buffet in Vegas.  It beats the buffet at Caesar's palace by a mile.  I paid about $35 for a Thursday afternoon buffet at the Wynn, and $60 for a Saturday afternoon buffet at Caesar's, and there is no comparison as to which one has better food.  If you're deciding between these two buffets, pick the Wynn."
T1u8MUWXmGu49XrBMXhG_Q,4,"My Vietnamese coworker has been raving about this place and that his family comes at least once a week. We were in the area today and had a chance to grab lunch. The restaurant is located in a busy plaza but parking is plentiful. 

The restaurant is spacious with enough seating. The tables seems to cater to larger groups. The place is busy but seating opens up fairly quickly. The restaurant's washrooms are small but clean. 

We ordered the Pho House Special, Bun Bo Hue and the Grilled Pork Chop with Shredded Pork, Rice and Vegetables. Each dish came in large portions. The prices were fair. Service is attentive enough as you shouldn't expect to trade pleasantries with the waitstaff. You write down your order, they pick it up and bring you the food. Make sure that you inform them whether you want tea or cold water in between those interactions. Otherwise, they don't come to your table to see how is your meal. Each dish was seasoned correctly as this place does Pho right! 

If we have a craving for Pho and we are in Mississauga, this will be our first choice. 

Highly recommended!"

...if it had not been so good I'd blame a friend for pointing out that Drago Sisters is right down the street from Sugar Bees, but in retrospect I guess I owe her thanks for adding to a truly ""sweet"" Saturday when seven items from the small bakery found their way back to my home as an extension of breakfast...or a midday snack...or ""3rd meal""...out of six.  A somewhat eclectic place with nuances ranging from classic French to Modern American and even Hispanic dotting an otherwise Italian collection of pastries it was with much indecision that I stood pondering the selections but eventually succumbing to a combination of personal tastes and staff suggestions everything that followed was artisan craft at its best; cakes dense yet supple, frosting sweet but light, macarons a crisp break with natural, smooth filling followed by an ethereal linger, and two items warranting ""destination"" status; first a Boston Cream Pie superior to the original in texture, cream, as well as cocoa and the second a small cup (available in sizes up to a full celebratory cake) filled with a baba style sponge oversaturated in sweet, milky tones and topped with piped pastry cream plus dark chocolate chips...

0JdFymzVcT8RZf6_K3B9aw,4,"Modern Burger...just the name lifts your expectations if not your curiosity. Unfortunately, whatever hope I had for new, delightful, and different was crushed by reality - its just a facade, a marketing ploy to whip your senses into gear for yet another burger and fries, charge more for it, and, if you follow that line of thinking its more tax revenue - and that is partially why its not a BK. But,  this is all ok, its just par for the course. (I did fall for it, but I remember the Alamo!...so to speak).

What is Modern Burger @ PHX Int. Airport?

- Modern fastfood, modern only in name, high price being its true differentiator (relative to twin arches).  

- Small seating area accommodates those wishing to dwell...Kitty corner view of TV at neighboring edtablishment 

- Music - The Feelies ""Modern Rythms"", a pioneer of the early 89s alternative sound, true standout!

      - TY MB!..you've totally redeemed yourself!

- Double Bacon Cheese Burger - LTO...greasy, cheesy mess...taste is closest to 5 Guys...I prefer grilled patties to the fried variety....they forgot the L and T so I got that on the side, upside was it was cold..(Take note MB, that's how Root Burger does it, works!)... overall ok, I'd hoped for better. Ate 3 qtrs.

- Fries were excellent - bright spot

- Chocolate shake was basically unmemorable and totally bland

$18...eh...not so great for that price, this was a double though. Good place if you need to eat and run and your expectations are just that."

1jIAo3SX5Y7zgXlK2LkFmg,1,Worst service! Came in on a Saturday and no one greeted or asked me if I needed any help. I stood in from of the cashier area for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. There were at least a dozen times when someone walked in front of me not saying anything. Thank goodness there are other places to visit at Town Square. Rude service on top of that.
MHydAX2vA8wv_kQLqnoyfQ,5,"I love Los Olivos!  It's an awesome, family run business in a cool old building.  The food is delicious!  Having been several times, I do not think that I had anything that was not good!  The bar makes a great margarita too.  My favorite dish is the shredded chicken burro with red sauce.  Its just as good as the chimichanga, but I feel much better eating it!  The cheese crisp is large, delicious, and very cheesy.  I love coming here with my family when they come to town to visit because eating at Los Olivos feels like you are at home."

I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem. Okay.. i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i'd consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet, that's a problem. 

c'mon its chicken tikka masala. make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself. this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel.

sG5XZz3T1jow3IF22IpAlQ,3,"We went to U.S. Egg after my son's baptism a few weeks ago. We called a week ahead to put our 'name in' because our party was for 14 people and they don't technically take reservations.  I was glad to hear that they would put our group at the top of the list for our convenience and we wouldn't have to wait that long (Which was great because we had a baby and an elderly family member). When the Sunday morning came (10am) we arrived and we were greeted very warmly. How refreshing, a busy restaurant smiling and not freaking out due to the party size. The restaurant was bright and seemed rather casual. They seated us promptly (no waiting). There was a manager (I believe) that even took our cake we had back to the fridge so it didn't take up space and would be fresh ready to go after brunch. He was so nice! Now comes the food part. It took a long time for a waitress to come over and take our order. Which was odd, you would think with a party that big, the server wouldn't have that many other tables. The poor girl had 4 aside from us!! Poor thing. Although we were starving, when the waitress did finally take our order (15+ minutes), she was very pleasant. I could bet she was frazzled, but she didn't show it when she arrived at our table. So ordering wait time was not good, but once again, customer service was nice.  And after all, a good experience at a food restaurant is highly based on the staff. I ordered pancakes, turkey sausage, and scrambled eggs. All very good, but nothing was 'amazing' or 'had to have'. But was hot, had just the right amt. of seasoning. And the food arrived pretty quickly after ordering (normal for a large party size). Please note, they do have a menu for gluten free I believe. (One member of the party had to order special for their diet). Then the manager brought out the cake we brought and a bunch of plates (and 'to go boxes for the rest of the cake).Very nice indeed. After all was done, we had to split the bill unfortunately, so it created a bit of havoc when separating the bill. My sister had a coffee on her bill (and she didn't order one) and we had a whole meal added to our bill and we had to get that removed. The manager again stepped in and was very cordial and removed the item (after 15 min. of discussion with the waitress). 

All-in-all, we would go back to this restaurant, it wasn't that expensive, had a great staff, and decent food."

I asked him and he was explaining there was no need to remove the cuticles because I had none, which I understand because my skin are too thin that you can hardly tell and might just cause to bleed but ah well......However,  the staff were very accommodating and the they did good in the foot massage so the 3 stars."

fQx3lUCBvjRfKqYJFp7FvQ,1,"Even though I live around the block I'm never coming back here.

Went in to grab one of those overpriced cold press juices they have. I buy it on debit and leave.
I shake the bottle and all these moldy specks appear; I keep shaking and they don't disappear. Expiration date is two days ago. Apparently pulling rotten inventory from the fridge is not a priority here. 

Upon returning, the staff:

A. Don't know how to refund debit purchases at first and spend a few minutes texting for help. 

B. Eventually attempt to refund me the charged amount and not my 15% tip (I'll never again tip for a bottled beverage purchase EVER at a cafe again).

C. Very likely didn't refund me correctly since the refund amount hasn't appeared on my bank statement. EDIT: Hours later and no refund, which means they 100% straight up took my money for free.

So go to Tokyo Smoke if you want to have to inspect expiry dates with zero confidence that anyone here gives a crap either way, or only bring cash knowing full-well getting a debit refund won't happen, and also if you've been dying to spend 11.50 dollars and receive precisely 0.00 in return for it!"

Apl7pZsd1bnehqsa9GWR_A,5,"I did a good bit of research prior to chosing Total Spine for my back issues. I didn't request a specific doctor , however I was scheduled with Dr. Giedraitis. The staff was very friendly and got me in the same week. I did read reviews on a variety of review sites out of curiosity as my back ground is in Medical/ Cosmetic Practice Consulting. There weren't many but what I could find mostly focused on negative bedside manner. This didn't phase me because having worked and consulted with hundreds of physicians my personal opinion on bedside manner doesn't sway my decision on choosing a doctor. I mostly care that the doctor listens, explains and sets up a plan to address my problems and doesn't make me feel unimportant. Bottom line. If they can do that in 10 minutes or if it takes 30 minutes I don't care. He did exactly what I needed without all the fluff and basically straight to the point. That's what I care about. His bedside manner was never an issue and I personally feel patients put too much emphasis on this overall. Are you inviting your doctor to Thanksgiving dinner or do you want your issues addressed?  Doctors are people too and have a tremendous responsibility and schedule. No one has perfect days and Doctors minds work a lot different than others. They are scientists as well as a businessman/woman. They have families and responsibilities like we all do. Do your part as the patient so doctors can do theirs to best care for you. They have multiple patients, multiple procedures, meetings, documentation,  protocol to follow that constantly is being changed by the government and FDA. Tests to order, tests to read, patients to refer, doctors to correspond with, partners to work with and employees to rely on for a smooth daily process and not to mention Insurance companies who want to only pay pennies on the dollar and then they write off thousands of dollars for work done that they won't get paid for. It's not the glamorous high life. Long story short.... if your doctor seems rushed there's a reason... if you have questions they can't read your mind, if you want warm and fuzzy get a kitten. If you want a good , qualified doctor get referrals,  research and check their history. 

Personally, I think Dr. G has a fine bedside manner. I feel he is focused on the best approach for his patients and he explained my condition and options in detail and he did listen to my concerns and addressed them accordingly. Everything was seamless and I have had my appointments, tests, follow ups and procedures schedule all within days of each other. 

Dr. G actually compared a past xray I had and read the report and found that the radiologist missed something and he took new x-rays to compare and showed me what was missed and set me up for an MRI with specific instructions to the technician to focus on the area in question and get a better look into the area that was overlooked. This to me is far more important than the warm and fuzzies.

I appreciate their flexibility and getting me schedule in a timely manner and I'm extremely grateful that there is a plan in place to address my extreme back pain and I'm looking forward to regaining a better quality of life with the professional guidance of Dr.G.

So what had the most hype wasn't great but I did like a couple things. Got seated right away during  peak time Friday night and waiter was attentive. The restaurant looks nice too."

e92Au0vsMlPACUIQ-wuzDg,1,This is the second time we have come here and they were shutting things down more than 30 min prior to the posted close time. The first time the doors were even locked and we could not get in. This time we got there at 8:00PM and the hot bar was being taken down and the man making the burgers was very inconvenienced by us making an order despite the fact that the sign said both were open until 8:30PM.

The main was okay, I little bland but not horrible.  The dessert was actually really, really good.  Best part of the meal.  The biggest complaint though was HOW HOT IT WAS in the restaurant!!  It was actually extremely uncomfortable, and took away from our experience because we just wanted to get out of there and get some cool air!  The management told us it was out of their control as it was the building, but I can't believe there's nothing they can do about this.  He was sweating while telling us!  The poor waiters were dying!"
Ww6gNt7yrsguZJJDWH3MmA,1,Worst experience. My fiancé went in there the day of our engagement pictures to get his hair colored. He told the lady doing his hair that we were  getting pictures. After she started coloring his hair she said this was her first time doing a beard and then said he shouldn't be doing it the day of. The first color she mixed up was too red and he told her but she said it will look good. It came out red!! She redid it with a darker color but did it soooo sloppy. There was dye on his forehead!! I made him walk across the street to La Lou and they took care of it there. They cleaned up the dye and blended it into his hair better. But my godddd how incompetent can you be! Why did she even start if she's never done a beard??

I have used Kent Mortensen Plumbing Co. on a few occasions at my rental property, and also to replace the garbage disposal at my personal residence.

Dinner was good - I got the Steak Bernaise and enjoyed the sauce. It was a really thin slice of steak though, so even though I asked for it ""medium,"" it probably came out well.
One of my dinner companions got the Vegetable Pot Au Feu (after a 3-hour meat fest at one of the buffets, he wanted a little vegetables) - it was a good flavored dish and a nice mix of cauliflower, carrots, brussell sprouts, and other veggies. However, the veggies were a little on the limp side. Another dinner companion got the Slow Braised Lamb Shank. A huge piece of lamb on a stick came out - you definitely got what you paid for.. It was delicious - lamb was perfectly cooked and the flavors were intense."

VpGaypQlpwRJVSx1qGCRGw,5,"Let me start by appology. On my mobile writing this review. I am not a foodie, or destination diner. I have been a chef for 30 years. When I do dine out of course expectations are high. This was for my wife birthday. We have been married for 32 years (yeah as long as I've been cooking). I will bypass the service, waiter was just sub par. Not bad but not great. On to the food. Menu is small plate driven which is what I wanted for us. Order a few and then some. Well, our waiter brought the first 2 courses on 2 boards. We were in no hurry, so why bring them at the same time? Then not even half way through the next one came. I asked waiter to take it back until we were done with first 2. My wife could see the kitchen and that were off set (they don't want it?).  Anyway, we enjoyed what we had. Baba gnouch and ceviche. both outstanding. Then the braised bison with a bunch of goodies and purees.(phenomenal). Does it get better? Next was the Kobe beef tartar with a perfectly cooked soft egg on top with croutons. ( chef note. Good but needed more mustard and capers, perhaps brandy). Then we asked for the menu to order one entree. My wife asked the waiter what he suggested. Bacon wrapped waaaabbbbbitttttt. She said sold. After first plates coming out toooooo fast. The waaabbbbiiiitttyyy took a long time. But it was totally worth the wait. (Again phenomenal). OK,now one bad for our waiter. We listen to another waiter totally blow his table away with dinner descriptions! Always us! Figures! Out waiter didn't even pour our wine during our stay. Really? Wtf. At 55 bucks at least make us feel welcomed. Then we had desert. Pineapple upside down cake with house made ice cream. (Both of us in bliss and I don't eat desserts at all). So you say does this review make merrit? I am a professor teaching culinary arts to the up and coming folks. My final tally, get me an awesome waiter, cause chefs food was too die for! P.s. hope someone shares this with the chef and his staff. Coudos brother!"
8X_Ge7hvwKCyVHBMoScGZQ,4,"After dinner last night, I realized I had been to Zen a dozen times and I felt it was finally time to give Zen some recognition.  It's next to my yoga studio so it's always been a great spot to grab a bite with my friend after class.  There is a reason why it is often described as a little ""neighborhood gem"" -  it's exactly that. You will be greeted with a smile and - speaking from my experiences - the service is always great.  

I glimpsed over some other reviews and a lot of people seem really stuck on the concept of having Spanish and Asian on the same menu.  So, for those new to Charlotte, I'll give you a little history on how that came to be. You probably already know that Spanish food is still hard to come by in Charlotte - well, back in the early 2000's the owner of Zen used to have another gem called Solé Spanish Grille (down the street where Kid Cashew just opened), it was sister restaurant to Miró Spanish Grille, which if I'm right is Zagat rated and still thriving in Ballantyne.  At the time having just returned from living in Spain, Solé was one of my absolute favorite spots - especially since nobody else in Charlotte seemed to have an affinity for Spanish cuisine.  I was gutted when I heard they were closing because the building had gotten bought by a new patron.  

HOWEVER the result of this was Zen - and as a former patron and fan of Solé, that already set the bar high for me.  Zen gets five stars simply for essentially being a part of our neighborhood for more than a decade - and for continuing to fill that void in our city for Spanish cuisine.  We have to appreciate restaurants for the passion behind them and for what they bring to markets they serve.  A five star review doesn't mean it has to be a five star restaurant.  I have been to Michelin star restaurants, and if you learn anything from that is that they don't follow the rules.  Zen isn't trying to break barriers by putting Asian and Spanish on the same menu - to me, it is a great Spanish restaurant that has reinvented itself to include an Asian fare, a solid choice for good food and an unpretentious dining experience."

YvBFP0OLU_xASWed8w9ZqA,5,"In my opinion, put Red Lobster out of your head, and head here!  This place is phenomenal in all their seafood selections.  My husband and I chose to bring his parents here tonight, they are from PA, frequent Rehobeth Beach, DE, and they raved how some of what they ate parelled what they get ""at the shore""!  

For aps, my husband had the clams casino, my father-in-law had the wings, I had the ceviche, all excellent!  For dinner mother-in-law had the fish n' chips, father-in-law and husband had the harvest platter, I had the enchiladas with crab...amazing!  My MIL wanted the fish tacos, but she chose last minute the fish n' chips, and she loved it.  The boys loved the platter, although the crab cakes were less than desireable, and my enchiladas were the best seafood enchiladas I've ever had.  I have compared them to Maria Maria's crab enchilada suizas, these stand out beyond them.  

This place is like a sleeping secret, and I wanted to share this place should not be overlooked.  Its in the far southwest corner at Dana Park, is hidden, and is worthy of your seafood cravings!  

No more Red Lobster, people, give this place a go, and it is all sorts of family good, big tables, excellent food, good drinks.  Give to the locals, not to the chains.  They also have seafood for purchase, and its fresh as AZ can get it, and the prices are good.  I love the Salt Cellar, but they have since raised their rates through the roof, we looked for less pricey, and they serve up just as amazing food.  Its quaint as well, reminding you that you are in a local seafood joint, and takes you as if you were just off the beach, whether west coast or east coast.  We have the east coasters to prove it!"

Service adviser disappears several times into the bay to confer with the technician -after- my car was on the hoist and the work order entered.  Now minutes later said service adviser calls me over to say that there is a BENT WIRE punctured the sidewall of my Michelin tire and a replacement was exactly $x and that I should order it now.  There is no way that my tires, stored throughout the winter in my garage, could have suffered this type of puncture.  SCAMMERS! I kindly asked that the winter tire be remounted, I paid for the 3 tires that were rotated, and I drove away, NEVER TO RETURN."
Dis2Htate4pFaNClt_Y02g,5,"My first experience was pleasant and the employee was polite and knowledgeable. They applied a glass cover protector on my phone and although it didn't adhere correctly I called the store the same day and they said to come back anytime and they would remedy the situation. I went in today and the retail sales manager named Nicole was aloof and told me that it was a manufacture's warranty issue and that she could not help me. Nicole Fukuzawa stated it was my responsibility to get a warranty. I have been with AT&T since 2007 and they have always been helpful as I've spent a lot of money on service and accessories. I would highly recommend it if you want good service that you go to another store. I called AT&T when I got home and they were kind enough to give me a $35 credit (although money was not my issue) and assured me that they will be contacting the area manager. Although it is uncertain if they will, I surely hope they do as the customer service is subpar! She definitely should not work with new or existing customers at any capacity."

OYRdt3b_s04t2j-FcEI09A,5,We were looking for a good halal place that had something for everyone. We ordered cheese pizza and supreme pizza which the kids liked watching them roll out and freshly toss. The pizza was so quick and fresh with halal pepperoni and beef and fresh green peppers and onion. The smell was enough to tell you that it was going to be really good which the first bite only confirmed. We ordered two double burgers and hamburger and cheeseburger which were equally yummy. Juicy burgers dropping with mayo and ketchup and all the trimmings. My little 5 yr old ate a whole six slice cheese pizza saying it was the best pizza he's ever had. The tomato sauce is perfect not a tangy or avidly sauce at all. Just perfect. I will be back to try chicken burger and philly sandwich. Those look amazing as well. The guys behind the counter were so sweet and amazing at making the meal hot and quick.my husband is Pakistani and I'm American and this was amazing place to eat at.

I personally went for a mango dipped in dark chocolate, and then I did a drizzle of white chocolate because...we'll do I need a reason for more chocolate? You can put multiple toppings on the pop and then voila! They hand it to you with a little cardboard to catch things as they fall off because they know you went overboard with the toppings.

So all I've got left to say is - yum!"

My husband had the Jumbalaya Pasta and he said it was really good. The sausage could have been more spicy but my husband really loves his food spicy. There were 5 shrimp, nice sized and not over cooked.  He also had a cup of the Steak Chili as his starter

He enjoyed that chili and told me that the next time he wants to have the stuffed baked potato with the Steak Chili.  So it must have been good!

My mother and I had both had a cup of their Clam Chowder, which is still yummy as on our previous visits

We had the Club House Sandwich.  I really liked that garlic aioli, however my mother thought it was strong.  Keep in mind that my mother is 82 yrs young and her taste buds have been changing as she's gotten a little older.

We both loved those shoe string fries

The only time we get to eat at Claim Jumpers is when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.  We normally go to the one located on Charleston, on our way back from Redrock but since we were at the Golden Nugget we decided to eat at this Claim Jumper

We had a late lunch so it was not crowded at all.

This is were my biggest complaint comes in:  The service was horrible!!!

My husband asked for iced tea, the server said that they only had Tropical Iced Tea.  My husband asked what was in it.
The response:  I don't know, just order it

I was about to say something but my husband squeezed my hand to signal me to bite my tongue. 

He did go ahead and order it and he said it was ok.

We got our soup and our server advised us that we would have a different server going forward.

Our food came but we were still eating the soup.  So the new server had to move things around to put the plates on the table.

My mother had hot tea and she had asked for more hot water.  

My husband asked for hot sauce

Server said he would bring it right over.  

He was helping other tables, going back and forth, so we waited.  

I noticed a bottle of hot sauce on an empty table nearby so I got it for my husband

We had finished eating and there was still no hot water

So I got up and walked all the way in the back and asked for the hot water

They acted so offended that I came to get the hot water.  I told them just give me the hot water.  A different server refused to give it to me and insisted that the hot water would be brought to us.  

I didn't think it was a problem to go get it but they made it seemed like I committed a felony.  So this really made me irritated.

Our server brought over the hot water a few minutes later

He then had the nerve to grumble to my mother about the food left on her plate.  I told my mom to ignore him because I could tell by her expression that she felt bad.  She ate half of her food and for us that is a good thing.

At this point, my husband got upset so he left only a $3.00 on $69.00 tab

Having worked in food service my husband normally tips 20% but this guy was just straight up rude.

We will eat at Claim Jumper again but not at the one in Golden Nugget

We will go back to the one on Charleston since we've always had great service from them!

Food = 5 Stars

Service = 1 Star

k0PP2vocX_8ekExINAXeCw,2,"Yesterday I picked up a pizza at Aiellos. When our family wants a pizza ""treat"", we go there. I ordered at 8:40 pm and picked up my 8 cut, pepperoni and mushroom, green pepper and olive pizza, (nothing fancy but the $19 price)about 9 pm. The pizza looked beautiful. It tasted like it was reheated. The cheese was separated, the mushrooms had a slimy quality and there was no flavor to anything else. Very disappointed, no more overpriced Aiellos pizza for me! Oddly enough after watching MSNBC last week I will try another Squirrel Hill pizza institution.
Last week while President Obama was in Pittsburgh, a smiling Howard Fineman made a comment on Hardball to the effect of, ""I hope he, referring to our President, gets a chance to stop at Mineo's for a pizza"". I have never had a Mineos pizza, but I trust Howard on all things political and now, on Pizza too.!! The poor quality of yesterday's pizza shocked us. Really, Aiellos, if you don't want to make a pizza on Sunday evening, please don't accept my order or my money."

T3Ag-gykjOikRu5zyy45Ig,5,"I love to give good reviews to the places which deserve them. I really do.

And Haru really deserves it.

Yes I live in McKenzie, but there's no bias - just sheer luck to have a great sushi place in the neighbourhood. I'd drive long distances if needed, glad I can just walk in.

Service is the best part of the experience - these guys are genuine, attentive, polite, and just fun to deal with - always smiling, friendly, jumping in to fulfil every need you may possibly have.

Good menu. I guess I've eaten all of it back and forth, and would love to see more items on it, but still - good stuff, enough to choose from for a while.

Needless to say, I've been to Haru almost every other weekend for more than a year, and neither me nor my wife had ever encounter something that won't be fresh and carefully prepared. We love that.

Another big plus is that Haru folks are so accommodating - when we arrive with our little one, they always help moving a stroller so it won't bother anyone, and give us a table which allows stuffing the baby seat in.

And the most important, it's not just about us, our family - we regularly observe the same level of respect and attention to the rest of the customers.

Good job Haru, and thanks for all the fish! ;-)

Well not yet though, as we'd surely return again and again..."
ylhCzsL1wcE4fmZ-gbeBTQ,1,"Best thing about my meal here was they had bottled Augustiner, everything else was so far downhill i couldn't even keep my footing. 

There is one spot in chicago that does similar sandwiches with fries and cole slaw with the bread between the meat so I had a little experience before this visit.  I got two sandwiches the cheese steak and the corned beef.  both we very bad.  Bread was fresh, fries were hot but that is about it.  every bite all i tasted was fries with an after taste of sweet slaw.  the steak in the cheese steak  tasted like it was made in a microwave.  the meat had to have been bought at a local grocery store because it was as bland as bland gets.   

I guess it's my fault for getting the corned beef.  why would a place in the middle of freaking PA have a good corned beef sandwich.  they didn't, took one bite and threw it out.  beef was very dry and the overwhelming taste of the fries and slaw once again dominated the tasteless flavor. 

before both sandwiches found the garbage i pulled the meat out to taste separately in case i missed something, i didn't.  complete waste of time, money and what could have been a more flavorful experience at a nearby Jimmy Johns"
5ORtQFsEsBIMju2lsSMeUw,4,"I love their rotisserie chicken, it's tender, juicy and well seasoned without being over seasoned.  The sauces to go with the chicken are great too!  

Now, I LOVE their salads.   They are packed with all things healthy, like kale and such....but they end up tasting great.    This means i tend to get a good filling meal, without feeling heavy or sleepy afterwards, which is great as a power lunch.   

Their chicken dinner is a pretty decent deal, I'll likely get that on Foodora the next time we are home and want healthy takeout.   Or I'm happy just getting a few roast chickens and cooking my own sides when guests come, and then say I did it because, how would they know?  :-P

This is the first place that I have ever been to that they take your pet out of your sight to do any type of procedure on them and this bothers me...I do not understand why they find this necessary to upset the animal that does not know them by taking them out of sight of the owner/parent...just my opinion but have never had to go through this with any other vet before for a shot, blood draw, etc..."
XJ69-QTlbqw3V0eucjvoog,4,"My House Chinese Cuisine just opened up around the corner from me. I've been waiting patiently for them to open and am glad they finally did! I have a weak spot for Chinese take out, and always welcome any new places to hopefully add to my rotation. 
I left this morning to find a menu to My House on my doorstep..... I took this as a sign that I HAVE to try this for dinner. I had plenty of time to peruse the menu, and decided on walnut shrimp, green jade vegetables, and crab rangoons.

Here's my verdict on each of my menu items I ordered:

Walnut Shrimp - generous portion! Large shrimp,  lightly  breaded and flavorful on their own. Complimented well by the walnuts and the white sauce. I especially love that this wasnt drenched and drowning in sauce. It allowed for the other flavors to shine through.

Green Jade Vegetables - as you may have guessed it.... this is an entree of green veggies. Green beans, broccoli, snap peas tossed in a white sauce. Again, lightly sauced not soaking in sauce. Very flavorful for a side of veggies, I was pleasantly surprised.

Crab Rangoons - Aahhhh yes, crab rangoons, my guilty pleasure. One of the deciding factors I consider whether I will return to a Chinese  restaurant is how much I like their crab rangoons.  These were top notch. The wonton wrappers were fried perfectly. Light crunch, good texture.... not hard or too chewy. The cream cheese filling was seasoned/ filled with something magical that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Needless to say, I'll be back. I wish this business all the luck. If they keep up with the quality food they served up tonight, they will do extremely well."

I actually don't mind going to the Lizard because, while the sports aren't my scene, the food is really good for bar food and the beer selection is great. Also highly recommend going in September for their Clambakes."

jpXK-ttjS0MFPpxr9cFAIw,1,"I used to love coming to this restaurant when they first opened. It was called Itamae before. The food was really good but I feel like ever since they changed the name, staff, food everything went down hill. 
A couple of weeks ago I decided to bring my cousins here for lunch. Everything was fine until the bill came. All 3 of us split the bill, and I noticed that there was a charge of $4.99 on my bill. When I asked the server what the $4.99 was, he told me it's because my daughter ate. I told him that my daughter is not even 1 year old, she is only 9 Months, why am I getting charged $5 dollars for it? His response was because ""she ate"". My daughter can't even eat a lot, she had a little bit of rice and small pieces of salmon teriyaki. Still the server was still arguing that I had to pay because she ate. I told him, most restaurants ONLY charge $2.99 for children who are 2 years and older. Which I can understand, because at that age, most children can properly eat, but $4.99..... for not even eating half of a bowl of rice, that's just ridiculous! So, ended up paying because the server refused to take it out my bill. Never ever going back to this place!"

kzZAjuCIWZTlnTS6z_auew,5,"I'm cheap.  Soho is not AYCE. Because I am a cheap b$t#ch, I usually frequent AYCE sushi establishments.  But I will spend $$ when it counts, i.e., great food.  Seeing all the love from my fellow Yelpers, I decided to leave my comfort zone and check out Soho.  Best. Decision. Ever.

Take the 215 to Jones and drive until you think you are out of the city limits, just kidding (sort of).  This location is not ideal, but it is well worth the extra effort.  We sat at the sushi bar and were treated like royalty.  All of the staff seemed very happy to take care of us and service was spot on.  In this commercialized, sometimes generic city, I am a sucker for pride of ownership.  The owner, John, was behind the bar serving up amazing fish.  He stopped to chat and really made our experience a great one.  

I cannot stress enough that every single thing we had was awesome.  The two stand-outs were probably the salmon wasabi (crème fraiche on salmon?!?! yummy!) and the bomb oysters, but it is really hard to pick favorites because it was all delish.  Yes, dinner was a little more expensive than my standard AYCE, but I felt like I got more than I paid for, which says a lot coming from me.  See comments above.  Chomping at the bit to return to this little fish paradise."
MRqT5J-mllYDLaitAbyBHQ,4,"expect to wait in long lines and fight for a table inside or out. This place is popular and hyped for a reason... It's just good.

stepping off the plane, my friend and I wanted our very first stop to be In-N-Out, so we took a taxi there...yep, WITH our luggage...and found a table near probably the only outlet in the place, where the workers kept coming by asking if we were fine... not even giving us any sort of fuss about charging our phones and waiting for our third person to arrive two hours later.
*quick shout out to worker Ed for making us laugh with stories about how much Spirit Airlines sucks*

So the food:

I did a little research and found out about the secret menu and ordered the Double Double - Animal Syle combo. This was fast food but it was so different from McDonald's or Burger King. The beef tasted fresher and the animal style hint of mustard plus the secret sauce really made it stand out. 

No matter what time you go, there's always a line but the employees (there's like 40 people back there) are quick and organized.

I really respect that the chain doesn't expand towards the east coast. It gives tourists something to look forward to when they arrive."
8pFAgx0BJIo4erCdfEhwSg,3,"The two stars are for the food, which was just ok. My order was also served incorrectly. The drinks were great, however, and the atmosphere was top-notch."
OLpGqlcwENBej54zO41ZNg,1,Gross! Very average to below average food and small and. It was not a good experience! You could get over how small it is when you come pick up your food if the food was actually good but it's so average to below average Chinese that he appearance makes it so much worse.  Won't go back
9adrCXUJ2n_fbfDb9_Uojw,4,"This is by far one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. The suites were very spacious and reasonably priced for how many people you can cram into these rooms (with beds of course).  There is a comfy sectional couch with a single pull out bed, a tv in the bathroom and many other amenities. 

The elevators are really fast.

My biggest complaint is that when we ordered towels, a blanket and extra pillows, it took 1.5 hrs to receive, which was so long that even the Priority Card center called in to check on us to make sure we received. What made it worse was that when I called in after 45 minutes of waiting, the housekeeping lady that picked up claimed I only called in 20  minutes ago, but that was actually just the time she decided to put in my order. This made us miss meeting our friends at another casino, which obviously ruined our experience.

30 min +taxi line...ridiculous.

No poker room.

On the brighter side, this casino doesn't take commission on most tables and has a non-smoking section, which is really nice for us non smokers. 

All in all I would definitely stay here again!"
p_WzgTZZo6Rwu_TaWOyb6Q,3,"My boyfriend lived here when we first started dated and I eventually moved in with him. His unit was located right next to the pool. 

He paid extra to be by the pool and regretted it immediately. There was a straight up fiesta at the pool every single night until 11 or 12 every night. Kids screaming, splashing and generally making a lot of noise. 

The actual unit was beautiful. The kitchen was huge and beautiful. 
I love the built in desk in the living room. The full size washer dryers was conveniently located in the hallway between the two bedrooms. 

I really liked this apartment but it was very far from my work and we ended up moving."

I was eying some guy who got a HUGE French onion soup. It looked like twice the normal size. Should have gotten one. Get that French Onion Soup!!!"

URBkWdUIYZggHhNFD7wQig,4,I had the Lola burger and it was very good I loved the pickle bar and all the sauces on the table. The only reason I'm not giving it  5 stars is because the shakes are way too big I asked the waitress if I could have a smaller sized one and she said no so I didn't get one I was very disappointed  I hope they change this you would think they would make more money if they offered a smaller size no one person could drink it all without getting sick. and they aren't that cheap
TdLquSctHnqFl4gh9yJjtg,5,Great prices! So reasonable. Clean! Great selections! Went there on a Saturday afternoon.. Absolutely packed now that must say something. Carne Asada and horchata is always on the list.!

$26.99 for a weekday dinner AYCE

Went here for a friend's birthday. The menu had a wide variety of selection in Japanese and Thai cuisines. Fast, friendly service. And very tasty food.

My only criticism is that the dessert doesn't come with the AYCE price... it's extra! Very disappointed and wouldn't come here again just because of that"
tExauqUalCmmm0-a6Xgfrg,5,"First off I waited to review Ibby's because 1. I'm lazy, 2. I thought I didn't need to as the food and reputation should speak for itself. Then I finally read some reviews and now feel I NEED to do one. So, I started coming here when Ibby's moved to new management and Antoine took over. My husband told me we should try it, and so we did and have been coming here ever since. All food is cooked to order, which I love way better than chicken or fish that sits under a lamp! So this means it will be a minimum of 10 mins and that's okay with me. My food has always been delicious, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I can speak to the juiciness of the fried chicken and delicious baked smothered turkey legs. The rice is amazing and I'm really picky about my rice as I prefer Jasmine. The gravy is amazing to not have any flour in it! I don't do cheese so I can't speak to the macaroni and cheese taste, but my husband and kids love it! The macaroni from what I hear has changed along the way and I think that's because Ibby's listens to their patrons and learns from any past inconsistencies. I love that with every meal you get a free drink and I believe the prices fall in line with soul food/fish fry places from where I'm from which is the Bay Area. The generous 3 sides with dinners are very filling. The greens are clean, tasty and not runny and freezer-like and not over seasoned. When I come here I have many dishes. Usually when I have a place that I love to go to I only have one dish that's my favorite. At Ibby's on any given day I can order from at least 5 different meals. I love the catfish, the fried chicken, the baked chicken, the baked turkey legs and shrimp! The sweet potatoes and cobbler are my favs as well and you will not be disappointed! I've also been to other restaurants nearby (Ezekiel's/LoLo's) and I honestly can't find one that compares. When we first started going there I was really antisocial. But everyone there makes you feel like family and they'll remember you if you go often. If you personally had a problem with your order, speak to Antoine, he will make sure you walk out pleased. The best part about eating here is that I don't leave feeling overwhelmingly heavy and guilty. Have you ever ate fried chicken or fish and felt bogged down afterwards? That's what I love about the cooking here! They deliver AND you can call ahead to place your order! It's been challenging for me to find a place where the food is as good as its rumored to be. I've found that place in Ibby's!"

3pbwUMtXg-CYoS4b6bZmdA,1,"I have gone to this establishment a number of times, and have never really had an exceptional experience in regards to the food, drinks or the service at any time. It has seemed to have gone even further downhill recently. Last week I went again because it's close and to see if there was anything new. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes to have our drink order taken. We were there for a few hours, and it wasn't even busy that night. I had ordered a veal dish, and it came soaking in a bowl of grease. I sent it back and the hostess/manager was visibly angry about it and insisted that it was because the butter they put on top - melted. I still was not okay with a dinner soaking in grease..... It was gross. 
We ended up with crab legs and bread....  Aside from the food served, the ambiance needs a serious update. There is a pretty thick layer of dust all over the ceiling and walls, and it smells like something gross - moldy covered by a powerful cleanser. I will not be making my way back here anytime soon. Too bad- there are not enough lakeside spots this side of town!"

mNBxNDHUYeaFuU8xJG3FYQ,5,"Ron is awesome! Under his guidance, I overcame an injury that plagued my running for over a year. After working with Ron as a PT/coach for just a few months, I ran a 10k in 40:49, which is a PR, and a half marathon in 1:30.52, which is right on my PR. These results are huge for me! I used to think that my fastest days were behind me, but I no longer believe that at all. 

When I first contacted Ron, I had been battling a hip/back injury for over a year. This injury caused me to limp (literally) the last four miles of a half marathon. Afterward, I couldn't run more than five miles without significant discomfort, and I had a dull ache in my lower back that was constantly present in my daily life. This went on for months.

I tried all the usual things: Ice, foam roller, stretching, a chiropractor, and diagnosing myself on WebMD. None of this worked. I finally broke down and asked my PCP for a referral to a physical therapist. However, when I went in for my appointment, the physical therapist told me flat-out that there wasn't anything he could do to help me because I was ""already pretty fit."" 

After some Googling, I came across Maximum Velocity Physical Therapy. I was intrigued because Ron describes himself as running/triathlon focused, which is EXACTLY what I wanted. I sent him kind of a crazy, desperate email, and he replied back within hours. My immediate impression was that I'd be in good hands with Ron, and that impression turned out to be 100% correct.

During my first appointment, Ron identified several weaknesses that he thought were contributing to my injury. He prescribed some strengthening exercises and told me that I'd be running pain-free in no time. Frankly, I did not believe him. How could I overcome a year-long injury so quickly? But it turns out he was right. After several weeks of working with Ron, I was able to run long and hard again. And equally amazing--that dull ache in my back finally went away. Thank goodness! 

Several attributes set Ron apart from other physical therapists I have encountered: He is relentlessly positive, has a passion for educating his clients/athletes, and genuinely cares. Plus, he knows how to work with runners and triathletes, which is a rare find. These attributes also happen to make him a great coach. I had a fantastic time working with Ron during my last training cycle, and I'm looking forward to working him in the future. This is not a decision I take lightly; I'm very serious about my training and racing, so it's a big deal to have a coach I trust.

In short: Ron has my highest recommendation. Go see him if you have a stubborn injury, and go see him if you want to get faster!"
C9kRaAlLNHyjWocL69TrSA,1,"Extremely unprofessional. I would give them 0 stars if I could. I was scheduled to get my hair blow dried and styled for my baby shower at 11 am on a Sunday morning. I showed up for my appointment only to find out that they were closed without any prior notice. 

There were 3 other guests that had been waiting outside in the snow since 10 am. 

It has been 4 days since my event and I have yet to receive a call to at least ""try"" to explain their unprofessionalism. I posted a review on their Facebook page and they just deleted their page. 

Do not trust them with styling your hair for major life events."

My favourite dish is probably the lettuce wraps. I also appreciate that they have seaweed salad on the menu.

Is this a fancy restaurant? Hyellll nah. Is it somewhere I would go back to and take a friend? Absolutely."
uH5SJwUg-Wb4VUJveOj6iw,1,Food is of mediocre quality and they got the takeout order wrong.

OfPgqWLYlwgD_cT4mSFdPQ,4,"Came here for some delicious Signature Pan Roast.   We have never been to this oyster bar and wanted to check it out along with the slots at the sunset station.   We were greeted immediately and given menus.   We sat up at the oyster bar top along with other families.   I even saw kids way under 21 sitting at the bar top so I'm assuming it's ok.   We were given free bread and we both got the Pan roast.  You get three different options of spicy: mild, medium, or hot.   I got medium and my wife got mild.   When we got out Pan roast.   Medium was not spicy at all.   I shoulda got the spicy for it to be remotely hot at all.   I tried my wife's mild and wow hers needed some spice to bring the flavors out.    Even though the spice levels weren't what we were expecting, the Pan roast was seriously good!   The portion size was big too!  I will be back."
8FvsOL07Kmx8WGWWS8TZlw,4,"Makai - think: chipotle but for Hawaiian/Asian fusion cuisine. There are pre-made items that you just pick and choose.

You get to select what size you want, the smallest being 1 meat and 1 side. The next would be 2 meats and 2 sides. There were even options to make your own bowl or do an a la carte selection.

I chose the smallest. This was $5 and honestly was pretty satisfying - did not make me too full but I was good. It'd be a great lunch size. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with a side of garlic edamame and you get your choice of rice. Brown rice was a little extra, fyi. 

The teriyaki chicken was cooked to perfection. They have a station next to the drinks that has teriyaki sauce (+ a spicy version if you so desire) so you can add more or add it to your rice like I did!

The garlic edamame was cold. I'm wondering if you can ask for it to be warmed up as I didn't like it as much cold. 

Overall the food was enjoyable and I'd come here again for either a quick lunch or dinner. Definitely possible to go in & out if you're on a time crunch and the options give you a variety where you can try something new every time you come!"

My dad called up Canada Tire and spoke to Adam, who agreed to let us come in even though they were at closing time. My sister and I drove the car over with one flat, praying the entire time. Adam was able to hook us up with a new tire that worked with the existing ones and it was a more than fair price, including installation.

IT0uG6Bo9wT9PJzuhXofyQ,1,"Horrible.   Placed an in store order with the manager for a very specific birthday cake for my son 2 weeks in advance. My son and I went to pick up his cake an hour before his birthday and ended up waiting for over 20 minutes while one of the employees was in the washroom (the whole time! Hungover!?) and the other employee apparently  couldn't help me with my cake.  I don't know if it was ready at all even when I was very specific with my pick up time and gave them 2 weeks notice.  When the employee finally came out of the washroom and was able to get around to my cake it was completely wrong!!! They wouldn't refund my money and offered to make me another cake which would take another 20+ minutes.  They would have rather swallowed the cost of a Wonder Woman Birthday cake with my sons name on it rather give it to me with a nice apology.  The manager was a jerk on the phone, incredibly  patronizing and horribly condescending.  We will never go back.   Ps. Cake was old and freezer burned."
I41WNVGQusLm7swaV5Y_BQ,2,"I really wanted to like Planta more. 

As a vegetarian, Toronto's first ""upscale"" plant-based restaurant opening up was really exciting. However, the food just didn't impress me. 

Cauliflower tots were nice, truffle fries were ok. Habibi salad was nothing really special, and the planta burger underwhelmed me (although I do enjoy grabbing a quick burger from their Planta Burger location in the financial district). The Frenchie was strange as well, and my boyfriend (who ordered it) felt quite sick after.

Cocktails were nice though! And the ambience and service were lovely. But overall, I haven't been dying to go back. Prices are way too high and food is nothing really that special."

VxUALCIgn3dtGFzyn4Pbxw,4,"I had a nice lunch at Mesa Grill.  I came on a Friday at about 11:45am and it wasn't too crowded, but by the time I left around 12:30pm, it seemed like quite the place to be, especially for business lunches/convention attendees. 

I went with chicken eggs benedict, which is supposedly very similar to their brunch dish.  I wanted to try to get a feel for brunch without coming on a weekend.  I did just that with this delicious dish with a nice spiciness that you usually don't get from traditional brunch options.  My meal came with three options of bread as well: raisin, jalapeno, and corn.  The jalapeno was the only one in which I would recommend; the other two were just eh.

My benedict was a very good option.  The other meals at Mesa Grill looked good and portion sizes were excellent.  At $18 for my meal, I think it was probably $3 too expensive, but celebrity chefs are able to get away with that.  Drink options were pretty limited and started at $14 so I didn't even try.  

Mesa Grill has some very interesting dishes with a totally different flare.  They also have quick and great service all around.  You will surely pay a little too much for the meal but if you're craving a New Mexican style entree on strip, this is by far your best bet."
BM8a01SMHfSR0ZPCDD3dGw,4,"Who knew we had this hidden little Italian gem out here in the East Valley! Went here on a whim because I saw the Yelp deal, but it would've been worth paying full price for the taste and quality for such lusciously creamy gelato. I love chocolate, but I'm picky and can't stand when there's an artificial/chemical aftertaste. I was not disappointed- the dark chocolate was deep, rich and satisfying. They also let us get half and half flavors which many other places won't do.  Bonus- they have a little Italian store/deli with imported meats and cheese. Can't wait to try out both sides- will definitely be back."
UjU2vMfSz7pWaz7h2wOaTQ,3,"So I came here with my friend really expecting a sundubu that would resurrect Jesus again so it was a little natural that we were mildly underwhelmed.

We both ordered different sundubu I ordered the classic sundubu and she ordered the miso one. There is a lot of tofu in it and the broth is nice and savory goes perfect with the rice. However it did taste a lot like any old sundubu that you can get in a Korean restaurant and jesus stayed very much dead. 

The service was alright nothing special and the restaurant is small and quaint the prices are good but the sundubu is just average."
rj67L4E2MSN3AvBKM5hrhw,1,"Terrible service. Will never come here again. There was no one in the drive thru. Nor was there anyone in the dinning area. Yet the gal at the drive thru that looked like a clown had us waiting for almost a good 7 mins till she finally took our order. 
For one look more presentable at work. She look she was stuck in October season."
R_0O8lO3AdPfMfM75mromQ,1,"This review is for the donation center only. Given my recent experience, I will never donate to Goodwill again. If you furniture or other household goods call Habitat for Humanity or Opportunity Village who will also pick up from your home. Unfortunately for me, neither had appointments on the day I was available.

That being said I saw online that they can pick up the larger items you want to donate. Great! I fill out the form to schedule a pickup and am contacted via email asking me to call and schedule an appointment. That's just my own personal pet peeve....a business that has email but insists you call. I ignored and proceded to schedule my pick up via email. I was given a date for my appointment but they will not give a time or even a window.

The day of, around 10am I call to see if they could at least give me a window of time when to expect the driver. A girl who before I've even said anything is annoyed that someone dare interrupt her day and for sure sounds like she hates her job picks up. I Gove her my information and ask if there is a time frame for which I can expect someone to stop by. She very curtly tells me I'm #8 on the list and that's all she will say. Me being me I push for more and she finally informs pick ups are made between 8am and 430pm. (remember that next time you complain about the cable/utility companies and their broad windows haha)

So I continue waiting and finally at 208pm I get a call from the driver saying he's on his way. Perfect! Then 45 minutes passes and still I'm waiting. I call the driver and ask how much longer and he says something I can't hear. I advise his voice is hard to hear and he hangs up on me. I call the donation center back trying to get an ETA and advising of what just happened and don't really get any new information. Another 20 minutes or so the donation center calls and tells me the driver was ""confused"" but I'm next on the list. It's 330pm at this point. An entire day wasted.

Shortly after I get a call again from the driver telling me he's on his way. I ask how long and he says he doesn't know, he just passed The M. So you work and live in Vegas but don't know the drive time from The M to the southwest side of town? More importantly you're a delivery driver who has a set schedule of appointments and you haven't planned your routes via GPS or Google Maps?? Another 40 minutes pass and he finally arrives. I show him what needs to be taken and that's when they advise they don't move items from second floor locations nor do they accept televisions. At no point was I given these stipulations. I had help here the day before who could have moved the items to the first floor.


Overall I think at this point Goodwill might be too large of a corporation (yes, technically non profit org) to appreciate that people are willing to support and donate to their organization. And that a little customer service/politeness/GOOD WILL goes a long way. Definitely take the time to research and donate to  other organizations!"
TrQZuouYa_qeaEoIv0x2QA,4,"Bagels are pretty good here. Had the bagel BLT and the bacon was perfectly cooked. Service is always great too. Only downside is the surcharge when you ask for a cheesy bagel, $1.80 extra is a bit much."
88KhUlfrOa7xzcR5Uk6KEg,4,"*review for the store, not the carrier*

It just occurred to me after a spending a whole day with a friend that my life is a little more.. simplify.  Because the first thing that comes to mind when I think about phone is headaches.  Well, not here, my friend.  NOT UP IN HEA!

I've been coming for years for as long as I've been with ATT and grandfather in at a really good rate.  For that I feel like I'm getting instant VIP status every single time I set a foot inside.  I'm all about that red rope access because frankly i don't get any love anywhere else but here.  I'm in an out like a superstar within a reasonable time.  Even on the latest gadget release date because everyone else are caught up at the other main stores.  

Let's face it, not all celebrity knows everything about cell phone company. All the techs here have been here since the beginnings, so they know what they're talking about when they level me with any concern or questions i have without making me feel like a moron.  I take my mom here too because i can't translate some of the technical cellphone stuff they're able to.

This store is filled with phone accessories.  I recently got a bunch of phone cases and chargers for like 5bucks each as stocking stuffers this past holiday.

//Cheesecake Tart// (14.99)This was recommended to me by by my co-worker and cousin and I was really excited to try this famous cheesecake. Sadly, I was underwhelmed by the taste. It wasn't as cheesy as I hoped and it tasted too light. This particular cheese tart had a thin jelly upper layer that gave the cheese tart an interesting texture (not quite a fan of it). 
//Golden Brulee Cheese Pudding// (3.99) Packaged in its own to-go box with the sugar and caramel sauce. The pudding itself was airy and firm and it was yummy. The caramel sauce was too concentrated and gave a liquor-y taste. I would've prefer the pudding by itself. 
S E R V I C E 
The staff here were pleasant and focused on their work. They packaged everything in a timely manner. There was one person ahead of us so we got lucky that the service was quick.

This is a cool place to come to if you can't afford to go to the original in Japan. This place is beautifully decorated to suit the modernness of the store and it has a cute overhead light that resembles a gooey cheesecake. There's a variety of seating in this cozy establishment. They have a wall you can buy merchandise from. I love how you can see the freshly baked Cheesecake Tart getting the signature emblem near the entrance of the store.  Though the Cheesecake Tart's texture and flavor was underwhelming I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other items."
uKKdgpIKjmAUrrwGQQbygA,5,"We tried their food at their new location at Birchmount and Sheppard. Great experience, loved the horchata, pupusas and especially their chicken burrito. Hadn't had El Salvadoran cuisine in many years and this was just great! They work on only cash or debit, however. Who doesn't have a credit card machine these days? There is a device now that turns your iPhone into a credit card machine for god's sake...well, take some cash and go for the food :)"

6tDBaHNkAupb3rNSCQ0mhA,4,"This is a such a cute coffee shop that looks like it came straight out of Pinterest! It's the perfect little place for a nice brunch date.

The parking is a shared lot and quite small but I got a spot right away on a weekend for brunch. There were a lot of people waiting at the front (all waiting for their coffee to go) so I was seated immediately. Service was good from the moment we walked in. The barista at the front was friendly, as was our server. The wait for our food wasn't long at all, so that was great too. 

The menu is simple and straight forward so it was very easy for me to decide on what I wanted. My partner and I ordered the Platform Waffle and the Sunrise Waffle. They were both yummy but I preferred the Sunrise Waffle more. I think I spent too much time trying to take pictures of the Platform waffle because it got soggy (oops!)  The potato curls were soo addicting! I couldn't stop munching on these. The pricing is average at $15-16 for each waffle. 

Of course, I had to order something to drink at Platform Espresso Bar. I ended up ordering a cappuccino. They were supposed to have two types of espresso to choose from but as they were in between seasons, there was only one in stock, which I was completely fine with. Taste was alright.

In conclusion, it's a cute little shop I would return to, but I wouldn't make it one of my regular stops."
dJmzLIjeLHTq97fy7vMGkg,4,"I've been coming here since I couldn't even eat solid foods. 

Pretty solid and standard place. The food hasn't changed much over 20 years. I've only gone here for brunch and it's pretty hard to mess that up. I always get the 3 egg breakfast. Good amount of home fries that are sprinkled with salt and some red stuff (it's pretty good). Eggs are always over easy. Bacon is a must. This is hit or miss. Can be crispy some days, but most days it's not too crispy. Toast is toast.

We know the waitresses at this place, so they're always pretty nice. I really recommend this place if you're hung over. They really give you a lot of food (carbs), it's pretty cheap, and it's pretty quiet unless you get a rowdy family with 5 jits up in the mix. Let's hope that doesn't happen to you."
W5lb8SiVkIisX8zuc9rRXQ,1,I've always loved eating here and have so for over 15 years. In the last 2 years the quality has slowly decreased but today was the worst. The fountain bar is always drenched and there was not even 1 piece of ice.Half of the salad bar had nearly empty containers and they were out of forks. Our salads were on point but when we went for the classic chicken noodle soup the chicken was so hard and tough we couldn't eat it. They pasta bar had mushy dry old pasta. It was approximate 5:30 when we arrived by 7pm it was still the same. The quality is just getting worse and worse. I don't know how their corporation could even be half pleased to allow the current quality of this place. Sad to say I'll have to find a new place
_XqJdDY9gNETwcFAIL0Ltg,2,Kind of your standard RI that is off strip.  My only pet peeve is that they appear to have renovated but just chose to paint cabinets instead of replacing them.  On top of these old cabinets they put in new quartz countertop and hardware.  What a waste.  And I'm sure I'm the only that is annoyed with this.  It's like putting quality lipstick on a pug.   I'm done ranting.  Not a bad location to stay if you don't want to be on the strip.
prab7Q2Iah2qIEMo2cfJxQ,5,This hidden little gem is the bomb-dot-com!!!  Thank you tropical smoothie drive thru and a big special thanks to all you haters for cracking me up with your pathetic reviews.  Ashley and Carolina...you ROCK ladies!  Until we meet again...
v2KTDCczCudqmt2CiueQpw,4,"Went here while traveling across the country on a stop to Vegas.  We had just left the MGM and decided we were hungry late at night and since coming from Ohio, where no Mexican restaurants are open late, we had to go!  Food is very average.  Overpriced and extremely Americanized Mexican food.  I was expecting a little bit more out of La Salsa Cantina but then we found the best part of this place, the yard margarita!

They were charging 17.50 for well tequila and 19 for top shelf tequila, which we chose!  You also get to keep the glass here, which was an added plus!  They don't play around with these drinks and they make them strong, taking care of us for the rest of the night!

I don't know if I'd suggest spending my money on food here, but definitely get the drinks if you do come here, well worth it, especially if you start the night here and get free drinks while gambling after for the rest of the night!"
xPJFt9EMweoECKPMhOfyGg,3,"I came here for dinner and to watch the NBA All Star Game.  The restaurant boasts a modern and lively atmosphere. There is a large fireplace in one corner, and a patio that wraps around the front of the restaurant, so I can see that this place has the potential to be a happening place, particularly in the summer time. Our server was very understanding to my incessant requests to get the game on the screen, so I was very appreciative of that. I was told they were having ""TV issues"" as the channels would change randomly throughout the night, and they were not able to turn on closed caption.  I was disappointed but nonetheless our server was friendly and attentive to my requests.  The food was good, nothing amazing, and I would consider the price point to be high for the type and quality of food. This place reminds me of Earl's or Joey's, a trendy place, with food that is nothing to write home about.  Service was really what made my experience enjoyable.  We ended up leaving at half time to enjoy the game at home instead."

This property is an older rehabbed property that is used for scammers of timeshare sales. parts of the building look presentable while other parts are rundown and older looking. The major concern here is the  salesmaen of Saphire Resorts. They will show nice resorts and hotels in many different areas but you do not have access to any of them. They lie, and try to get you to see a presentation for two hours. They wasted over  2 hours of our time. They lied repeatedly to us. They will promise show tickets, money for slot machines and food credit. The show tickets were able to be redeemed but the slot machine credit was a trick. It was only valid in a  run down casino on ""special"" machines that do not pay out any winnings. I won money but never a payout. The food credits were nice and place was too. They said we can cancel at anytime but that was a lie. They prices are extremely high and never use RCI.We are paying way over what they informed us I am so happy and nobody ever returns the call and they lied to us told us everyone doesn't have access to RCI every company who owns a timeshare does.

lQn0OZhGNWN5RVtPNZkfIg,3,"Where to begin?  To be honest, the food was okay.  Yes small portions for the $, but if the portions were bigger, I might still be there waiting for my plate. Started with the Spam fries.  They were okay.  Just enough for me and 2 friends to say we tried them.  Kinda like a hot dog coated in a crispy batter and fried.  I had the canton noodle.  Not sure what pickled peas are... But I could not find anything that resembled a pea. Wasn't a huge portion, so I may have missed the pea. It was okay but such a small portion.  The worst... My friends fried chicken arrived.  I swear to God 15 minutes later my other friends ox tail arrived and 2 minutes later my canton noodle.  It was weird 15 minutes watching my.friends food get cold while we waited for the other 2 orders.  Food was good. Table with 2 out of control toddlers was a drag.  They left thank God.  Been there... Won't go back. The mojito I had.... Could drink lots of them. But at 12 bucks a pop, I will create my own."
h6TTFF9KUpMANtyhUjl1Iw,4,"Location: First off, my guest and I (we drove separately) had a little difficulty finding this place. I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.

Venue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any ""prime tables"" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.

Food: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all. 

The mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.

Cost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.

Bottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside."
FinW7QphgrSJfqhunNmH9w,2,"I really wanted to like this place but it falls short. They do a little bit of false advertising which I called them on and they did not agree with me.  First off their bread is not freshly baked, they do not bake their bread in house, it is baked somewhere else and brought in.. Also their sauce is not exactly home made as they use can tomatoes and spices then add there own unique blend.  They do not know which foods have soy in them exactly, but all there fried food is fried in soy oil. The portions for lunch were very very skimpy only 5 ravioli's for $10.  Excuse me but paying $2.00 for one small ravioli is a little bit ridiculous.  They do not have butter for the bread, nor do they leave the oil and vinegar on the table.  So if you are bread eaters you will have to summon the wait staff lots of times to refill the oil and vinegar dish.  Not a good place for people who have allergies, hardly any gluten free items, no gluten free pasta dishes,  If you happen not to sit in a half booth bring a pillow as the chairs are very very hair and very very skinny.  The manager tried his best to accommodate me but not much to eat when they do not know the ingredients of many of their foods especially the ones which come from a can or are brought in from somewhere else."
kyreT4bNCLPksVq2H5mywg,3,"The setting is classic, 50s era smoking lounge. Though the stained mirrors on the walls, elegant velvet couches, black leather paneled bar and dark wood accents feel more like we have stepped into a century old establishment.

The cocktail menu is in keeping with the classic feel of the bar. Whiskey, rum, fernet. Inventive takes on classic drinks - but not something that is in everyone's wheel house.

Our motley crew sampled six of the cocktails featured on the menu. Perhaps it's that none of us appreciate bitters like we should, but we were all a bit underwhelmed. The menu of spirits here in stark contrast to what you will find in the restaurant below, and I love every drink I have ordered from that menu.

The place seats about 80, and it appeared there were two servers to a packed lounge. It was some time before anyone came to the table. In fact, our server passed us a couple times before acknowledging we were there. One of us headed up to the bar fully prepared to order cocktails for everyone at the table. They returned empty handed, as bullying up to the bar to place an order was an effort in futility."

If you're having any work done - I highly encourage you to get a quote - they're bid came in lower than others and a 1400 sq foot job was done in a matter of hours to perfection.

xwJrxiRYd6yJEChc9AnAPA,1,"Visited the place about 3 times in 3 months.  On the 3rd visit this place strikes out!   Parking lot has piles of trash, especially next to the fence of East side of parking lot. Each visit the piles have just grown larger.  Concern, the trash attracts roaches and rats.  Suggested a ""daily parking lot check"" with a broom and dust pan.  Owner/manager just looked at me as if I were an idiot.  Windows and blinds beyond filty. windows had a yellowish "" haze"" on them.  Blinds had a thick layer of dust and food on them.  Obviously, non-exsisting cleaning schedule.  Male bathroom had free standing urinal water under urinal.  Stall dividers were beyond filthy!

z809kpqUMr0mjxWCSYi8ng,5,"Perhaps this isn't my first time on this Earth? This was my first visit to Pike's and I loved it. It's not that the food was the best thing that ever happened to me. It's that the food was a solid 8/10. My waiter was an 11/10. The music was a 10/10. The weather the day I visited was a 10/10 (72 in January). Everyone who walked by and worked there smiled and spoke. My overall experience was wonderful. 

My waiter, and I forget his name. He was a very handsome, well built, young thang. He had a great sense of humor. Actually joked with us the whole time and was funny. Not corny, not annoying, legitimate not trying too hard made me laugh funny. You can tell he has a good personality 24/7 and I'm not saying that because he was cute. He even told me I was the slowest eater he ever saw. It's true. Management also walked by and asked if everything was okay. He was genuinely friendly. I loved everyone here.

My friend and I ordered the honey pecan fried chicken, which came with broccoli casserole and mashed potatoes. I subbed my mashed potatoes for sweet potato casserole at no additional cost (Yay!). We also shared spinach dip. The dip was creamy with lots of spinach. We ate every single bite of it. The chips were fresh. Not sure if they cook them in house, but they at least warm them up. Also noteworthy is the price point here is really good. $11/ meal.

The chicken was divine. I was a bit nauseous that day, and still couldn't stop eating. The chicken was cooked perfectly and a bit juicy without being drown in honey. The pecans were not cooked,which I think would've enhanced the flavor. I'm definitely going back and getting the exact same meal. Pike's is going to become one of my regular spots to visit."
gKbbSG6WXhMHizpHUH-Tkw,1,"I took my mom here today (Mothers day) and had the worst experience possible. When we first got there the waitress was nice and friendly, things changed quickly when the food came out. My mom ordered a egg omelet with mushrooms and onions, only 3 ingredients. I ordered the Cinnamon crumble pancakes l very easy order. When the food came out my mom got a fajita omelet with a ton of things she can't eat. We told the waitress about it and she got nasty with us and said ""Well, the manager said this is how it comes"" and did not offer to take it back and fix the very simple omelet my mom asked for. It was made clear that we were SOL. Then my food came the eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns were very good no issues there. My pancakes came out, I ordered the featured Cinnamon crumble pancakes. When I went to eat the pancakes I found one was a big chocolate chip pancake and the other was a small normal pancake with caramel spread on them (not what I ordered). Now that were 30 minutes in and have not been asked for refills on our drinks I'm getting very frustrated. I told the waitress my food was wrong as well and then the waitress replied with ""what are your eggs wrong"" and then laughed. I fail to see what's funny. I asked to speak to the manager and when she eventually came over she was already annoyed. When I told the manager about the waitress telling us the manager said ""that's how it comes"" she got upset and told my mom and I that she never said that, like she is a 5 year old child. Then she did tell us that our food would be free after giving us an attitude. When she picked up my pancakes to take them back we found a big black hair on my food, I have very short hair and my mom has short blonde hair so it wasn't ours.When that was also pointed out to the manager she literally huffed and stormed away. We never saw or heard from her again. I go there with my son a few times a week and have never had this experience here. I won't be going back and I recommend nobody else does either. WORST EMPLOYEES AND MANAGER EVER. The only reason you get 1 star is because we did not pay for the meal and I have too. The owner of this franchise location should be very disappointed!!"
f8Z8Jr9spRdv43pWgRRj2A,2,"The place is pretty small. Rmb to come early or avoid the peak time. It's self seat situation and really doesn't have any spaces to accommodate big groups. I ordered the mocha latte but was given a chai latte towards the very end of my meal. I need to leave really soon so didn't even bring it up. Waiters were so busy they don't even have time to refill water in the self serve area.  

We found ourselves a seat first then ordered and paid before we can sit down and waited for our food. The waiting time was a bit too long for a breakfast. Or maybe just the day I go? I don't know. I waited almost an hour. I would go somewhere else if in the rush for a quick bite. 

The meal tasted average for me, the eggs were pretty nice and runny tho."
oq5QVtwO-1SDrXQ1v_TqGg,1,"These people prey on innocent gullible people.  The distributors are deceptive and use scare tactics to get you to buy.  They give you a spiel on health risks to the family and they use high pressure sale pitches. 
I can't believe I actually entertained them but as soon as they finished with their sales pitch without even asking if I was interested the guy pulls out an application and begins asking for my information to get credit started.  I immediately told him I was not ready to get into another credit card payment and I am not interested.  He continued trying to make me feel guilty about my family's health and we shouldn't put a price on it....blah, blah, blah.  The seller then says let me see a correspondence or ID to see if you qualify, this is when he completely insulted my intelligence.  He looks at the mail and pretends to plug something into his phone and then says, ""yes you qualify for financing and you only pay $40 a month""  I asked how in the world would you know that, he proceeds to point to some numbers above my name on this letter ...COME ON ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! He knew how I was not the least bit interested but continued to pressure me  to the point that I felt this was too overwhelming for me and maybe they can leave me alone if I sign this sh*t. My husband was not around to help me out of this so I said yes and asked if I'm not satisfied with product can I return and they said yes, don't worry, and trust us. I told them I need to speak with my husband first then I will call him the next day to confirm.
I was so uneasy with this whole transaction that I could not sleep, had knots in my stomach and just didn't feel RIGHT.  Sure enough the next day I researched this company and saw so many negative reviews, and at this point I didn't care how great the products worked (and by the way amazon sells for a fraction of the cost). Someone online stated that the only way she got a refund was by cancelling your transactions by the first days of the sale.
I called the seller and of course his phone does not receive incoming calls.  So emailed him stating I will be cancelling my order today!  He immediately calls me and I tell him I want to cancel and furthermore I told him not submit my paperwork until I called him to confirm after I discuss with my husband , he responds, "" no don't worry we already processed your paperwork. He again reassured me that if I need a return it will be given to me, trust him and quickly rushes off the phone...HA!  
At this point I am being stringed along and feeling frustrated and taken advantage of.  I immediately called the company directly and questioned their return policy.  The rep stated that they there are NO RETURNS ALL SALES ARE FINAL!  You are only able to cancel within the first 3 day of transactions.  After those 3 days pass you are bind by contract to make payments even if you are not satisfied with product.
Follow these directions for returns:  please do so by before the first 3 business days of signing the transactions
1. Call the company (877) 494-2289, cancel and ask for a cancellation number
2. Fill the back of the sales transaction and print the cancellation # on the front and back of form
3. Fax to (708) 562-0320
4.  Call to verify they received fax
The customer service people are courteous and are not pushy at all!  When I called to verify they received my fax they said yes and it was sent to the distributor.  I will check in 5 days.
PLEASE SAVE YOURSELVES THE TROUBLE and to don't fall for this! They are slick and also try to tell if you cancel the salesperson gets a points on license and could lose their license. Well maybe they need to stop being pushy and if someone says not interested keep it moving and leave them alone.  SORRY BUT NOT SORRY to the sales person.  Rethink your tactics and be honest and stop pitching ""so called facts"", back it with real scientific research done with your products."
djAhNTH8UMZgFAbHH9Aekw,2,"Good beers,  but bad service. Sat for 10 min then got helped by a nice bartender. However I was never offered a food menu. Funny thing I sat down when it was not busy. I got helped once the crowd came in. 
Very disappointed would have liked to eat there after seeing some reviews. I found out they had food from watching the BS hotel channel."
1-jcB1dqLa8zdeG5OmkNbA,5,"We had the best server, I have had in years. I am a reviewer not by trade but by need to help others enjoy life. We, my friend M, my (K) friend and I went there for dinner at 6:30 ish, on a Saturday night July 30, 2016, were greeted by her. It was K's birthday. She oyr server, was very open and accommodating, saying to the ladies lets start with drinks, when they were not sure, offered coffee, water etc, my wife said we were looking for Bellinis.  Amy, I found out, was her name, suggested several, so the choice was Peach instead of strawberry. Yum. I had the coke as designated driver.  Next was food. The list was great but I went for safe choice on food, just a regular burger? Wrong, it not regular, its big. It can be made with various choices. My friend took the fried egg as a topping, yes.  I had the Sauteed mushrooms as well.  Amy was good, asking questions like Yolk side up or down, etc, on my Burger I got multi grain bun.  I had wanted whole wheat but loved this choice.  M, ordered Chicken Quesadilla as a starter but woah, its huge, its a meal. Also it has lots and lots of Chicken in it. She has had it at some known restaurants, ie the One starting with D (Franchise chain, various locations) and a sports bar starting with S (named after sea fish) and neither of those have even 1/3 the amount of chicken in it,  Names of competitors were left out. It serves no reason to name them.  Dixon's out did everyone.  My Burger was better than that of Five Guys, Gal and Fries place.  I am thinking if this is their regular style of menu, I will be eating here more often.   Our total was under $70.00. 
Amy our server checked on us several times, refilling the drinks, Coke and coffee, offering Mayonnaise for fries for my friend.  She said it was her second shift so I was nervous on bill, you know  having to ask about corrections, no, I did not need it. When members of my party wanted to split bill, I refused, sent them to VLT's where they made money, Amy took it as a sign to give me the bill quickly, paid for it, so the others would not see bill.  Ralph, Wheres the Bill? Oops it got soaked then destroyed, but its paid so you cannot share bill, ha ha. Guys This is how its done.  Amy was so professional, so sweet and not using her looks to sell food. She told us about the different foods, how some of them tasted, how big they were. 
About us: I am a very cautious eater, always checking ingredients etc for dietary and medical reasons, M is a person whom loves to try foods, but nervous about prep, K is a seasoned restaurant food eater. 
I wrote this long review so you understand everything was awesome.  I will go there again soon and will post again so you can see its not a 1 time excellent dinner.  The tv at table had UFC on screen, so it was a topic of sorts, we did not like the matches but that's opinion. You could put menu in front of screen to block show.  I felt very good about tonight's dining experience.  I left full (stomach) from just the burger and fries, this was unusual. I had no space for the desert, Apple Pie, which is like a slab in size. This is unusual."

_9CDrRuml-2d2SyHAOQfYg,5,"The food was amazing. Beer was ice cold, and there was a real funny nice guy behind the bar I think he said he was the new owner... anyways great food, cold beer and great staff. #Winning if you ask me!"
c-1vjFk0Vj74W9ziYKTyrg,5,Contacted A-Z Landscaping through Yelp because of great reviews. Text him photos of the palms that needed to be trimmed.  Spoke to Alex and he came within 2 hours to trim 2 of my palms. Palms look great and clean up was immaculate. Great price! I have asked him for a quote to even come back and put some trees in my backyard. Highly recommended.
y4UQnjRLYvG4sXvL0bQXKg,2,Stop in  this place with friends for late lunch as they have patio and weather was nice.  But food disapoined. Sand in the salad. Burned meatloaf.  Dirty tables. Service was good. That's why I give two point.
ngW-cf5YFObE4aqucgwxcQ,2,"The delivery guys are always super friendly, and the pizza is decent for a late night delivery place. No complaints about either. 

However the guys in the store answering phones are terrible. They interrupt, mumble, are short with you and are not friendly at all. I've dealt with it because they're the only people that deliver late, but after last night I'm never ordering there again.

We got home after a show at midnight and wanted food before bed so we ordered from the only place open: hungry howies. Ordering took several minutes because the guy kept interrupting me and mumbling and I had to ask him to repeat himself every single sentence, which was aggravating. He told me the pizza would be there in 45 minutes to an hour, which was fine. We sat up waiting, my boyfriend fell asleep and after an hour and a half I was so hungry I just made something else and was getting ready to get into bed when FINALLY, the guy shows up. The delivery guy was great, but overall this pizza place is insanely slow and the in store employees need some help with customer service."
Y_TsPYNM9PrvYzXApBQ5ag,2,"They had improved a bit after they had been open for a while, not great but worth the cheap cost.  We went back today about a month after our last visit, and they have gone down the tubes.  The sushi was horrid (I have never seen fish cut so thin!), the roast beef was cooked to shoe leather, the grill was gone, the soup was watery, the egg rolls were tough and leathery, and there was no dim sum or dumplings at all.  I had a hard time finding anything that was edible.  Even what passed for desserts was awful.  We will not be back again.  I was shocked how busy they were, but I guess the price will bring people in regardless of how horrible the food is."
FPz4MTPKLyQirOUmLtoNZg,1,"Came here for dinner to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with a party of 7, ended up being a total disappointment.

Strike 1: Lack of communication between staff. When we walked to the front door, a staff member politely opened the door for us. However, as we walked by him to enter into the restaurant, he said that no tables were currently available. He was just in the process of telling us the wait time, when one of the other staff members stated that we could be seated right away. At least check the tables before you turn customers away.

Strike 2: Water did not arrive at the table until after 20 minutes of being seated. PLUS, the ""Sweet"" Tea was NOT sweet at all. Water and Sweet Tea were requested, but we were left waiting and thirsty. The place was not packed with customers, and water/sweet tea should not take long to bring to the table.

Strike 3: My boyfriend, of all people, did not receive his entree until the rest of the table had just about finished their meals! He ordered the Seafood Delight, which is a combination of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, and scallops in marinara sauce over linguine for $19.95. I understand that it is a large dish and has a lot of components to it, but if it's not almost ready, don't bring out the rest of the table's meals yet, keep the other dishes heated on warmers in the kitchen. The waitress said it would be about 4 more minutes. It took a lot longer than 4 minutes. It did not take the rest of the table only 4 minutes to finish their meals. We were not speed-eating. We were chatting and enjoying our meals at a decent pace. PLUS, the waitress brought extra bread to the table when we still had plenty of bread, and there was clearly no more space for bread, except in front of my boyfriend, where his actual entree belonged. We were utterly confused. None of us had requested more bread. It was as if the waitress thought it would make things better if she brought more bread instead of the entree. We ended up having to wait on my boyfriend.

In terms of the other food, the Fried Calamari ($9.95) was chewy and the skin covering was pale and unappealing. It did not have the nice crisp to it that I was expecting. The Del Boscaiola (Parmesan cream sauce with prosciutto and peas for $11.25) was delicious. I chose Cappellini noodles. I enjoyed the sauce. There were far too many peas, but I didn't mind. The Seafood Delight should be shared. In terms of portion, it is too much for one person. I do like the shrimp and scallop. However, the presentation is sloppy.

Strike 4: I asked if they did anything special for birthdays. The waitress said the staff would sing ""Happy Birthday"" and give us a slice of Tiramisu. Fantastic. Except the staff failed to communicate again. It was supposed to be a surprise for my boyfriend. However, one staff member started approaching us and happily singing ""Happy Birthday."" Then, he stopped abruptly when he realized that nobody else was following suit. So much for a surprise. The rest of the staff then awkwardly tried to restart the singing and brought out the Tiramisu. Of course, the Tiramisu didn't even have a candle on it. Great. Well, at least the Tiramisu tasted great."
awZCzV2DbM9bSi7QE13O4g,1,"We came here for breakfast this morning....waiting to be served and in walks a lady with a dog......she was not trying to hide him.....was carrying him on a blanket    Showing him off in the waiting area while they were putting tables together for a large crowd.     Wait staff were aware of his presence.  No one said anything.  No service vest on dog...he was clearly a lap pet .....first thing he did when she sat down was reach out and lick the table!      How many health code regulations are being violated here?  Service was below par..... numerous wait staff walking around in red shirts yet we had a long wait to have our order taken, then another long wait  to be served...when food arrived it was cold...  on top of that, we had to ask for refills on drinks every time.    Server asked if I needed a box turned and walked away before asking anyone else in our party if they needed box, which they did, so she had to make another trip... manager did come over as we were leaving.  He was nice listened to our story.  But too late"
mlncne73mxiodaP3b0Da2A,4,"this place is pretty nice. very clean and minimalistic furniture and atmosphere. The service is very friendly. the thing I absolutely love about this place is the menu. 

LET ME TELL YOU! it seriously serves a very VERY limited amount of different dishes. Their specialty is obviously topoki so they have one page where you get to create your own topoki dish ranging from type of sauce, meat, and carbs that goes with it. another page is where the snacks are and then they have another page for specialty rice bowls. they also have a selection of drinks as well. 
I'm pretty sure that with every item combined on the menu... there's probably just about 20 items or so... prices are pretty good. 2 main dish with a snack was about $36 without tips. 

Recommendations: 

Popcorn chicken snack: very well done in terms of crispiness and flavour. comes with 2 sauce: wasabi mayo and some spicy red sauce i forgot the name to.

Bulgogi kimchi cheese rice: rice on bottom and bulgogi on one side and kimchi on the other side with melted cheese on top of everything, sprinkled with seaweed. Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. 

Topoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in."
HQEJwsuEhNKibAF0ijc-KA,5,"Authentic, delicious fresh food.  Excellent service.  The fresh tortillas and carne asada are amazing."

The virtual reality game, The Void - Ghostbusters is a must-do if you like shooting ghosts in a virtual reality game. Lasts around 10 min. 

If you'd like get win lots of tickets, Kung Fu Panda is a good one. If you have st least 3 people with quick reflexes then every game may gain you 500 tickets."

Valet parking, a mini patio area and updated interior. Referred by a friend at work over a year ago this has become my ""treat myself"" restaurant. The Vigazz burger is a life changer!"

We were definitely a rowdy bunch of bucks on the dance floor, the vibe was good, drinks were alright but their 2 dollar off well drinks on Fridays didn't really wet my whistle."
eHP9fXeFyu6V3o59-97cwA,2,"Went here last night for dinner. Although it is a great place for coffee and desert, I would never recommend for dinner. 

It is confusing. Either you order pizza from the almost non existent server, or you walk to the hot table and wait forever for food. So, essentially no one eats at the same time. 

Pizza:  I love wood oven pizza. I ordered the margarita which was described as tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil. When I got it I was shocked there was dried basil on it. Not fresh. Weird. 

If you want good pizza, go to Joia. This pizza wasn't good at all. 

Also, ordered a glass of wine, and not once did the server ask if I wanted more, nor did she ask any of us how our dinner was. I just thought the service wasn't good and the food was nothing to brag about."

The ring came out perfectly and she loved it. Thank you Ara!
vnU_QKpU6P32QdEJ1-da0g,3,"I joined this gym in January with my fiancé. It was crowded but everyone expects that when you join a gym in January! It was a great experience then. The cardio cinema is really great. I wanted to do my review after about 5 months to get the full picture. Well the place is now so overcrowded with people just standing around and the people there are what people warn you about with North Las Vegas. Not comfortable at all coming except to go to a class and leave. I would not go there just to work alone any more. Also, there really needs to be a timer for the movies because on more than one occasion I had to actually call the front desk to ask for someone to come and restart the movie!! Sad to see this awesome gym go down hill so quickly."
32irl9ijSQBDRQyHcc_Jwg,5,This is one of the best Italian restaurant in Madison. My husband and me both ordered a vegetarian dish. We ordered the vegetarian special of the day and a Tortalacci which was delicious and the food portions were also in apt amount. We finished off our entire meals.
kBLnNXN46w5EL9fLZY9zeQ,5,"It's been awhile since I stayed at the Wynn but it's a beautiful , contemporary hotel . I recommend you check out "" La Reve!""

OOc_X6-A8bjMaS5NZSt8kw,5,This is the only beer store I will ever shop at in Tempe. The owner there is very down to earth and knowledgeable and friendly. His prices are very fair. I love this place. 5+stars.
cwT1O0p6TyqS_Ojxzr6INA,2,"Although the food was good and the chef nice and talented the waitress made too many mistakes with our order. We asked to share one Rocky but she said it was for one person so we changed it to two Rocky's. She submitted only one to the kitchen and when the chef came out he questioned the ticket saying two and quickly went and grabbed the additional meat. That's fine except that we did not get the other stuff that comes with it, rice, soup, salad, vegies, shrimp etc. only double meat and full price. Not good. The other thing that was not good was some young twenty something year old and her boyfriend thinking it's ok to stuff your new puppy in your Coach handbag and sit down to a dinner table. NO, it was not a medical issue puppy, it was just a pug puppy. Completely unacceptable behavior. The manager saw the puppy and did nothing. If I wanted to sit down and eat with dogs I would go to the park not to a somewhat fancy restaurant. There were several other mistakes with our food but it did taste good."
KxcDudXshSFUqrln2IcDoA,4,"Discovered this place through my boyfriend and his family last year. The most important thing about this place is that they provide delicious food, with very good portion (actually fills up the boys' and men's belly) at a very reasonable price. 

A year ago, I ordered mussels and fries from their daily special menu (unfortunately I don't have a picture of it). This time, I got the 1) steak and frites - 10oz peppercorn crusted AAA NY strip loin, pinot noir, chalot & herb butter, grilled corn and frites. Cooked medium rare, to my request and liking. I usually don't like fries, but this time, I enjoyed it with their mayo and ketchup. 
My boyfriend ordered the 2) Fancy Bangers & mash  grilled locally produced sausage, balsamic marinated charred onions, red skin mashed potato, seasonal vegetables, gravy & mustard grains. 

We both enjoyed our food both times we went, plus they have a good service! We'll definitely go again.

Found her at her previously salon and followed her here to Lifespa. Ti is absolutely worth following and trying out if you're looking for a stylist!  She is amazingly talented with color, cuts, styling...you name it.  When I first started going to Ti, she took the time to listen and really understand my style. She genuinely loves what she does and it shows in her work!  What I also really appreciate about Ti is she takes the time to educate on styling as well as gives product tips making it easy for me to replicate the style at home.  She is friendly and welcoming and always delivers exceptional service!"
6dFYDyY1IfkVLDTVL9UmHA,1,Just the worst service.  Stood in line 10 mins just to deposit 200 bucks into their customers account. I go to Wells Fargo or chase and it's drop and go.  Then they needed to see my license to deposit.  This is why I bank on line and also a good reminder of why I don't bank here
Dp0EwXtcTe1NYEdDJgGCUw,1,"Total rip off. We were told over the phone that they would waive the $30 consultation fee. They sent a guy over the same day to check out our broken garage door. He was here for 30 seconds and barely looked at it and told us it would be $500 to fix a spring. He called his manager and lowered the price to $375, which is still way too expensive for what needed to be fixed. When we said we would be getting another estimate, he said he wasn't leaving without the $30 consultation fee, despite being told earlier that it was waived. I would never recommend this place, such a scam. Don't know how you can do business this way."
3VLq_fxm_UcheMfPLmJIEw,4,"I checked in here for lunch today. I usually do not use that function because I have a baby and a special needs 3-year-old so just to go out to eat at all is a pretty big undertaking.  Instead, I typically do my reviews afterwards from my desktop computer at home.  This time, our older child was not with us so I thought I'd try ""checking in"" for a change.  Much to my surprise, a 10% off offer just for checking in appeared on my phone!  CooL! When I showed it to the server,  I asked if I needed to let him know about it before ordering or at the conclusion of our meal he stated,  ""We can do it now. No problem.""  

He was very attentive, brought our drinks promptly, and even brought refills before our drinks were half empty. The food was served pretty quickly and was good. 

When the bill came, the 10% had not been taken off.  Another gentleman came to accept payment.   Therefore, I had to explain the. Whole Yelp thing over again to him which was kind of annoying. Also took a very long time for someone to come take my payment.  We had been ready to leave for a while and needed to go pick up our other son. 

Great service should not stop once the meal is served."
pK55fMal6m3W-I6sdDi4mw,5,"Eco Electric did an amazing job putting in ceiling fans and can lighting in our house. 

My husband and I had reached out to multiple electricians and were not having much success with people calling us back or being willing to come out to our house to give us a good quote. 

Eco Electric came out and spent well over an hour walking through what we wanted to do lighting wise in our house. They did a drawing showing where we wanted lights, when no other electrician had done that. They got back within about a week with a quote and then were able to come out and install about 1-2 weeks after that. 

The two men that came to our house, Michael and Robert (as well as Bill) were friendly, knowledgeable, and very respectful of our house. Especially since we had just put in brand new floors. They made sure to cover all of the house with visqueen. 

They got the whole project done in 1 day with 2 1/2 guys (Bill helped in the am). We had two ceiling fans (one in each living space), 4 can lights in each living space, and 8 can lights put into our kitchen. The living spaces have vaulted ceilings as well, so it was a big job. 

This business is wonderful and we plan on using them in the future when we get to renovating our bathroom. I would highly recommend asking for the same electricians, Michael and Robert but have no doubt their other employees are just as qualified!"
wlIxI_MZMkjZExX9lW4YxA,3,"Loved the setting, came out to Lake Las Vegas for a race and arrived late Friday and they were still open. There was live music playing at the Lake which killed the mood a tad but wasn't so bad. 

Checked the menu posted out front, walked in, took a few minutes to be helped. Everyone working seemed to be appalled I showed up on my own. Oops?

My issue is with the quality of the products the signature is on. Sure it says custom jersey but when purchasing stuff, I guess I just assumed that I would be receiving a piece of clothing that had a little quality to it. I won a signed Magic Johnson custom dream team jersey. I think my 6th grade YMCA basketball jersey was of highet quality fabric than this thing. Take away the patches sewn onto it and the signature and you would probably use it for a rag to clean your windows. Same goes for the custom hockey jerseys."

We waited outside for about 15 minutes before we made our way to the front of the line and got a table.  I have a high level of respect for the ""No BS"" hostess who was just trying to get everyone inside.  Of course, the idiots in front of us showed up with 12 people.  (Aside:  Look.  Don't freaking do that, alright?  You don't go to a place with a line out the door and ask to get 12 people seated.  Split up into smaller groups or something.  You're making life terrible for everyone else.)

And we're back...the sandwich was incredible.  Since every sandwich is identical except for the meat, the service is lightning quick.  From the moment we sat down, we had our food in less than 2 minutes, no exaggeration.  

Of course it was delicious and something I've never had before.  As I said, there is something to be said for doing one thing and doing it well.  I had another at the Pirates game that night!"

STUFFED DATES - these were my favorite. Very intensely sweet and salty. I wish there were more! 

MAC N CHEESE - I liked how the mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, however it was too salty. 

FILET MIGNON SLIDERS - the sliders were very yummy! I loved the cream sauce and the onion straws. There were leftover straws on the plate that I just wanted to eat up! I didn't think the ""filet mignon"" was all that special though...tasted like normal burger meat to me!

FRIED CALAMARI - you can't go wrong with these, ever! 

RED WINE SANGRIA - This I did not enjoy. I wanted to see more fruit, I wanted it to be more refreshing. 

I definitely think this is a nice alternative to the typical Vegas buffets, all while getting the same great variety!"
8IwmsJK6qFUYXn0G8kyfUw,3,"I don't usually dine at corporate restaurants, but I've been craving the Oriental Chicken Salad for some time now so I thought I'd grab one before my hair appointment. The salad was good. Just as I remember. Nothing spectacular, but subsided my craving. I was alone so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. Everyone was really helpful and the bartender is lovely, but she seems so overwhelmed having 6 patrons at the bar. I think she may have had another bartop table, but absolutely nothing crazy. A bartender shouldn't be weeded with so little going on. Maybe she was just having an off day, but I think it's a safe to suggest she's in the wrong field. 
I'll come back again when I have another craving but probably not soon. The happy hour drinks are a petty good deal of you want to grab a quick drink. Anyway, good luck!!!"
DnrrhohXIhdLTfYjMbntYg,2,"Gave this mall yet another try again today, disappointed again.  Easily second fiddle to any other mall in the area.  All the regular stores, plus some of the more trashy ones.  And watch out for the security nazis, same jerk came by twice in 6 min to tell my 3 kids to calm down, and we were outside the mall!?!  I figured outside was the best place for my kids to run & play while we waited for the stores to open.  Will continue to go to SouthPark of all my mall needs."
gdXMTorEl24Vwi0ZDMPMIA,1,"The absolute worse customer service I've ever seen. I tried to bring a bus group to the casino but after leaving over 16 messages with 8 different people, I received not one return call. I even contacted the acting general manager who of course I didn't answer the phone either, and had his assistant to call me back only to tell me they would not be able to work with us. I wonder how an organization like this stay in business. Well, my group of 60 or more people visit Arizona every year and we have no plans on visiting the casino ever again. I'm sure the area is full of businesses and merchants who would love to have our business. I would give this business a below zero rating if possible."
nkQ9iSx2gSiPweySb1XUjQ,1,"I have been eating Chinese food for years, never had Chinese food that tasted so bad! was greasy over cooked and was just off. spent like $20 and was very disappointed.  called the restaurant to try and get refund and they told me it wasn't there problem.  well it is now!  They are just taking advantage of there customers. They got your money no need to make you happy now.  This is not a American business and this is not the way Americans should be treated.  I will never be eating there again. I advise you do not eat there either."

znNRz3-ZzGEizVZ_-vbl-g,5,My fave is the Chinois Chicken Salad!!!!! Every time I am in Vegas I pay this place a visit! The waitstaff is friendly and this place is open SUPER late! I would always recommend this place to a friend and will definitely come here next time I am in Vegas!
nKWkEaF4Kwahl3yrEVzBEw,4,I frequently get take out from P.F. Changs. I get the fried rice with double shrimp and it is always delicious. Its most certainly enough to feed two people for around $10. I always use the curbside service and I've never had a problem. I call ahead and its ready in 15-20 minutes. I have dined inside this P.F. Changs on a few occasions and something always goes wrong. I'm definitely a fan of their take out but will probably never dine in again.
7lb-f4efgWP4RNQDwEmsLA,3,"Went there on a Friday evening. The NoDa area was booming. People everywhere. Had to circle longer than expected to get a parking spot. Hostess and waiter were very nice. Food was ok. Nothing to go too crazy about. With the front wall/bay door(whatever you want to call it) being open, a good amount of cigarette smoke travels from a nearby establishment. That smell is consistent and can be aggressive at times. 

Went for the experience because the wife mainly wanted to go.. but with so many other resturants in the area, we will likely try them out rather than returning here."

319qfxeuJg_LrSqW7Fq_Ug,1,"So I have purchased a car here 2xs. The first time should have been a fool me once. The 1st visit I was in desperate need so I took a stupid 07 Buick to later find out they charged me more than the car was worth, and now I'm stuck in some dumb shit that isn't even helping me, but more so helping them!. So here I am 2yrs later they call to advise they can put me in a car and get me out my situation, so I agree to take a chance. I go there under the impression I can get an Altima, but later find out I have to get a Nissan Sentra (ok no biggie). 2 weeks go by and my loan for my Buick is calling me telling me I am late on payments, so I contact LARRY H MILLER to see what is going on, they contact me back leaving me under  impression I needed to come in to FINALLY sign documents on a loan for the Nissan, but once I got there I was later advised otherwise NOW they want to take the Sentra and NOW put me in an Altima (which btw is what I previously requested),but due to their financial person making errors and finally getting fired my new monthly payments would increase by a whole lot. Moral of the story is this place is REALLY unorganized. they are 100% scammers. I would never do business with this place EVER AGAIN! and for all the fuckery they put me thru they also made me late on my paying my Buick vehicle payment due to them letting me just drive off the lot with no final paperwork (financial managers fault) and not keeping in contact with my for OVER 2 WEEKS!. FUCK THIS PLACE! DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT DEAL WITH THESE PPL. YOU WILL REGRET IT"
nM7tew4d_RAvuTCgsNVXeQ,4,Definitely like this location a lot better than the Henderson location. It gets fairly busy but it doesn't wreak of bbq smell like the one in Henderson. The layout is so much better as well cause it's a nice big rectangle. No wasted space so more seating area.
OxDIPmEwTKmUtKAbEg5AJQ,5,"In the past I had a terrible Dental Experience and I kept hearing good brings about Midwestern University, I thought I would give them a try .

I have had the best experience with my 2 Students Justin and Mathew they Are professional and help to keep me educated every step of the way from beginning of each visit to the end . When I have any questions they are kind enough to stop and answer to ease my mind . 
Justin is very gentle I hardly realize when I am getting my shots for my procedures . 
I have a lot of work to finish doing I am now in the middle of treatments fillings , crowns and in the future  an implant . I would recommend anyone and everyone to go here before heading to Mexico .

Every time you get your procedure done the Doctors come around and check give feedback , on if there's more to do or just fine ect . ! Call today you will be so happy that you did !!!

The food is delicious. Had a waffle with strawberries with tons of whipped cream! The waitress was nice, gave us advice on what to eat but forgot two things that we ordered.

z3TH_APz0M9CE1srJq310Q,1,"Ordered a 48 piece veggie set, and a 8 piece cucumber roll. What I received was a 48 piece set without the cucumber roll I paid for. After being on the phone with them for 15 minutes of them arguing it, saying their menu was wrong. The 48 piece set is actually a 40 piece set and the cucumber rolls i ordered are in there, that's why there are 48 pieces. Would not refund my money for the extra set I didn't receive, didn't care nor understand the issue, and said it was my fault. Ridiculous. After fighting forever with them, they finally gave me the cucumber roll I paid for.... except it wasn't cucumber rolls at all. It was rice unravelled with cucumber pieces all over the place. I'm sure the chef obviously saw that the pieces weren't rolled!??!  I'm not even talking a bit of spillage here, i'm saying all 8 rolls weren't rolls at all. It was a container of rice and cucumber. Absolutely ridiculous. Will never go back, don't waste your money."
GSlACCcrqViZXqI9Jnt9dg,5,"A couple weeks ago, I hosted my graduation party from high school here. Mr. Spano, the owner never missed a beat. He was more than helpful! We ended up having more people show up than we had originally planned for- but Mr. Spano and his staff brought more chairs, ensured everyone had something to drink, and had a plate of food in front of them. Another server cut and served the cake that we brought with us. In summary, this restaurant is highly recommended for their utmost care, and concern for their guests!!"

uiX7l1dtAmxHtR1NgkvSew,1,"For such a large post office, and one considered a hub, there isn't much nice to say about this place. There's always a line. And it is handled as slowly and inefficiently as possible. Worse yet, the employees act like you are an inconvenience.

It is always a pain in the butt to have to stop here. And when the mail gets messed up (as in have require a signature, but don't bother to ring the bell at the house) you can rest assured even more time will be spent trying to get it taken care of here. 

As the kids say, 'Easy peasy piece of pie', just add, 'when you come, here it's a pain, no lie'."

The balance of vegetables and meat in the dish was perfect.  The chicken had a very good flavor and was juicy.
  My husband ordered the Rigatoni Marinara Turkey Meatballs.  The presentation of this dish was not as appealing as the DK Pasta.  The Marinara was slightly lacking in seasoning.  There was a generous portion of meatballs and overall the dish was good.  Great customer service.
  Overall a good experience and the size of the portion was adequate for the cost.  We would definitely return to the restaurant."
gX6TE_HLtGCQrNSCWIooMQ,5,"We had these guys do some t-shirt printing for a company picnic that we had, and were looking for team t-shirts. Originally lured in by the $5 t-shirt vehicle wrap on a van parked near my home, we called in and said, ""saw the sign,"" not in an Ace of Base voice, ""what can you do with a 72 hour lead time?""

Pretty much anything... cool.

So, we sent over an extremely pixilated image of what we wanted, which they were able to help find a version that was actually workable and off to the races we went!

After several phone calls with us changing our mind (maybe 'several' is an understatement) we had proceeded to build what many would've seen as the worlds most expensive custom company picnic t-shirt. For us, approximately $13 per shirt seemed like a steal.

So, 72 hours later, we had spiffy new t-shirts, and while we looked stylish at the picnic, we didn't win any of the events. So, if you're looking for a cool shirt for a low price... look here. If you're looking for a winning lottery ticket to pop out of your shirt pocked, or you just need some general luck-- keep walking. Or pick up one of the pre-printed shirts with a funny saying that they have in stock, and at least you'll have laughed today.

BTW- the attached photos are after 2 (maybe 2) washes in the washing machine."
bw-jCJa_Di0CeamjyEAf1A,4,"My girlfriend and I stopped over here for lunch. We literally had the place to ourselves and were able to order off the lunch menu. The spicy items are marked accordingly and on the other side of the menu were Thai inspired dishes.

From her vantage point she could see some people coming in for take out. The lunch prices are very reasonable. With your choice of entree you get a choice of soup or eggroll, white, fried, or brown rice as your side. With your check you get a store bought fortune cookie.

She had the General Tso's chicken with rice and eggroll. I had the chicken and shrimp entree mixed with vegetables. Needless to say service was fast and the food very tasty. My friend told me that her General Tso's was not overly spicy. I enjoyed my dish as well. I was please with the portion size as I normally do not finish the rice when I order. Here it was just enough.

The eggrolls came with both the duck and hot sauce almost combined but you could tell the difference just by looking at it.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs and did ask if we wanted to split the check. I refused but was grateful she had asked.

This is a nice option when dining on Mt. Washington since Shiloh St has a lot of eateries as well as the Grandview bakery and love Pittsburgh shop. Street or lot metered parking is available. If you heading up that way avoid Sycamore St since part of that road is closed. Shiloh is a one way St so it is best to head over to Grandview Ave and proceed down from there.

We had a good lunch at a very reasonable price."
y0rAFnmvixL3lFlQW-C5lw,4,It was a good experience. I enjoyed it. The only negative is that I reserved a room with a King bed which when I got there was unavailable. Why then give me the options when I reserved if there are going to give me whatever they want.

36LRjPqfA9WvXEFvIsHlhA,5,"Every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi, I always refer them to Sushimon. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect. However having tried more than a few spots in town, and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places, Sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot. 

All the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  true

- This place is not close to the strip.
- The wait time can be long(sometimes topping out at 1 hour +
- The restaurant is smallish.

However, if you're visiting Vegas, and really want good sushi, is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking, not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place, and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the strip?

I've often found, that any restaurant, be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait, is doing something right.

Sushimon doesn't offer you fine dining service. It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.

I don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.

If you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.

All the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.

You could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.

But Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well. 

I know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.

Things I LOVE from Sushimon

Nigiri:
- Hamachi (Yellowtail)
- Salmon
- Super White Tuna
- Unagi

Other offerings:
- Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!)
- Salmon Collar
-All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer)
-Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person)
-Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)

Dessert(AYCE)
-Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla)
-Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream
- Tempura Ice cream

Sure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more ""glamorous"" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience. 

In case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list."
WdDn5x8cp-2SP_lnb1lllw,4,Very nice rooms.  Quiet and peaceful.  Away from Madison downtown but worth the drive.
CgIpzN27yRctFEj_PqPDXg,5,"Lots of cheapo stuff to look at, jewelry, plastic handbags, clothing, etc.
If you need something blingy to wear once or twice, you'll find it here. 
They usually have seasonal & holiday items, including gift ideas such as wine glasses. A sale section is always available too.

I recently purchased some stuff from the 70% off bins and one didn't ring at 70%. Not that complicated to remedy, one would imagine. The attitude I got was that I was wrong, they were right. After realizing I was in fact not making it up, did I get an apology? Of course not. It was one of the managers too!
I love it when the customer points out incorrect pricing then the employee fixes it but with attitude. Sigh! Terrible customer service."

tGU4ISrZBlwkJniv8gGNcw,4,"I like to eat  at Oakmont Deli once in a while to get a good sandwich.  The deli has a homey, old-fashioned feel to it. There are five tables inside the restaurant where you can eat or you can carry out. My favorite sandwich is corned beef and swiss on marble rye. Today I decided to get the combo:1/2 a sandwich plus a cup of clam chowder. You can make up your own sandwich or get one of the specialty sandwiches; and all sandwiches come with a crunchy pickle. For $2.25 you can can get double meat, but the sandwiches have plenty of meat on them. If you're looking for dessert, Oakmont Deli also sells gelato."
nvIfNmRbhj1JNICCmukjTA,3,"Had a Mani+Pedi.  Kate was so nice!  
Had troubles with scheduling though.  For a ""top-notch"" spa, they have a very rigid policy on cancellations and were not sympathetic to me having to travel 1.5 hours to get to the spa.  I almost turned around and called the coupon a loss!  
If Kate hadn't been so pleasant, I'd have written off this place.
It's a nice spa facility.  Tranquil except for the airplanes flying above-head, but you forget that once you start the treatment"
GrRrsd_hXt5QSs73LCSL5A,1,Went on a Thursday afternoon around 4 and was not greeted. Had to walk all the way in to someone that was working and ask for a gel manicure in which no one knew how to do but some lady in the back.  The polish was ovishly old and instead 2 coats I got 3. Never was asked how I wanted my nails shaped.  Will never go back.  There is a charger for credit use and tips are cash only.
KqOEomx_7r-JiFyFMAk0Ig,5,When it comes to customer service and quality product look no further than Element Wheels. I came on a Friday just to look at wheels and Justin made me an offer I couldn't refuse. The following Thursday I had my new wheels mounted. This might not sound like a big deal but there was a holiday within that 6 day span.  Great job to everyone that works at Element Wheels.
fBuIXRXM3EAG04-ZV3Lr_w,3,"As you might guess from the name Chez Ma Grosse Truie Cherie is not the best place to bring a vegetarian for supper.  For those of you unfamiliar with the word, truie means sow in French so the name refers to a fat female pig.  The menu is true to its name so there are plenty of pork-inspired dishes here.

The restaurant looks very simple and unassuming from the outside.  Once inside though it feels elegant and intimate.  It is also quite large inside so there is plenty of seating to be had.  They also have a terrasse that looks like it would be a nice place to sit in warmer months.

While there are some non-pork based dishes like beef tartare and duck I thought it best to see if the restaurant does a good job with pork products.  That meant that I ordered the tomahawk, which was a pork chop garnished with apple sauce and served with a sweet potato puree.  I enjoyed the flavours of the dish but I felt that the meat was a little overdone as it was on the tough and chewy side.  The portion was pretty big so I'm glad I skipped the appetizer since that would have been overkill.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's ribs which were really tender.

Dessert was a brownie served with caramel bacon ice cream.  The ice cream was really good and I liked how the salty and sweet balanced each other out.  The tiny chunks of bacon also added a nice touch.  The brownie on the other hand was rock hard and impossible to eat with the spoon they gave me.  It was really dense and chocolatey so that was what seemed to give it that hard texture but I would have traded some of that for something that was softer and easier to eat.

The service was great.  Our server seemed to know the menu inside and out and he did a great job with recommendations.  Everything arrived in a timely fashion and he did check on us regularly to see how we were doing.

Prices were okay but I felt that since my dishes weren't the greatest they could have been better.  I think the restaurant definitely has potential but it does need to work on its execution a bit.  The experience as a whole was just okay.  Nothing awful but nothing excellent either."
s6AJtBZ8U2Du5FOkkVkjow,2,"Damn this place is cute!!!!! Absolutely adorable branding and display. Treats behind the glass looked so tasty. 

I was walking around the area looking for coffee and am usually super weary of ""hipster"" coffee joints that charge exorbitant prices for terrible coffee and a pissy attitude. 
However I saw the menu on the window and the breakfast croissant meal really caught my eye. The prices looked very reasonable for a variety of brunch goodies. 

I went inside and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...luckily I wasn't in a hurry but come on! There were only 3 people ahead of me and no joke I waited over 20 minutes. 

There was only one guy doing everything! He was kind, professional, and didn't seem frazzled but how is one person supposed to take orders, make change, make the drinks, prepare the food, and serve tables? I hope they were just shortstaffed that day. 

Anyway, I FINALLY ordered and the employee put my sandwich on the grill. It was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big. Coffee was meh. Not the worst. Not good. My cup was very cute though! Oh when I went to pay the guy kinda looked up at me strangely from behind their ""square"" system thing and told me he would have to go downstairs for cash...what?! Who doesn't have cash?! I know I'm a millennial but come on! 
So yes, I waited again. Finally got my coffee and croissant. Way too much room in the coffee but oh well, I couldn't wait around again to ask for more. Croissant was large and I was starving. It was very very greasy but I like that. Give me all the butter please. Overall, I would go back because the food was cheap and while they were understaffed the employee was really nice and didn't act all frazzled and stressed or rude and annoyed. Just don't go if you have limited timing and can't spend 30minutes or more. 

Oh! one thing was weird! a pastry chef girl would occasionally emerge from the back and drop things off. She made NO facial expressions and didn't even clock the large group of people waiting. Maybe it's not her job to help but it seemed super weird not to even comment on the situation or acknowledge her co-worker. Maybe she was a robot."
4OKu7KA0qCfv4KQpaqcnGg,5,"Bistro La Bon is one of my favorite restaurants ever. I have only been there twice, but I crave it constantly. Unfortunately I live in Raleigh, so I don't get to go as often as I would like to.

I've tried a lot of thing here and all have been executed perfectly. They have a killer cheese plate, amazing mussels and the best bread pudding I have ever tasted, hands down.

Its a cozy place with all of my favorite comfort foods. Very friendly, knowledgeable wait staff. Great cocktails and wine list."
BLAlFw1LSoh4o8u5H2evDA,2,The menu states that the quesadilla comes with one choice of meat. Under the meat selection there is a vegetarian option listed that says beans and rice. When I received my order it was just a cheese quesadilla and they charged me extra for the guacamole.  The worker said the beans rice and guacamole did not apply to a vegetarian quesadilla.  What!?!?   So I just paid $14 for some cheese on a tortilla.  Ridiculous
na6nTA5O04MYP4_-n2aZ3Q,5,Great bbq ribs and prime rib. Attentive service. Terrific baseball memorabilia everywhere you look.
_sOvoHTj10i5dssimIBbUw,4,Was looking for WOC's and the sales person was really friendly to my surprise. I would def come back here if they have stock.  Better lucky next time for me.
x-am4peGe2wLqXEDPV6Rfg,5,"When in Vegas this is a must, either when we just drive in, if early enough or right before we are heading home.  Check in for your free banana muffin you will not be disappointed.  Reasonably priced, good service and amazing food.  Everything I have tried (chile relleno omelet, enchilada omelet, pancakes, steak and eggs) have all been delicious."
Pk1ufmqowURi7pB1AnNmow,4,"I'm all about customer service and this Courtyard has awesome staff! 

I travel for work frequently and know my way around a hotel. My room is always upgraded (perks of being platinum baby!). Some Courtyards also include a microwave in your room but this courtyard does not. However there's a microwave downstairs next to reception. I have a refrigerator in my room which helps because I practically live here Monday-Thursday. 

They have free shuttle service to and from Cleveland airport which rocks. And if you live local and want a cheap place to park your car they offer park n ride services for a fair price. 

The gym is tiny with 2 treadmills and 2 ellipticals and some free weights. They have a clean pool and hot tub. 

Food is expensive at their little cafe but you're within walking distance to all types of food options and the mall. 

Great location and friendly staff gives them 4 stars in my book."
gSeZA-dEC8vS1exne6-2Sw,4,Not the best ever but cheap and consistently good for the price. $5.95 for Pho Tai and the service is the fastest I've ever seen. Their Spring Rolls are pretty good too.

VB1ahYohSKgvY__H0XaUHQ,5,"I have been coming here since moving back from college in 2002. I love everything about this place; the complimentary beverages, the warm shaving cream neck shave, the attention to each persons haircut, but especially the people who work there. Julie my stylist and salon owner has been cutting my hair 9 years. Does amazing work and is a real sweetheart. Adrian another exceptional stylist does equally amazing. If your looking for a nice to place to look your best, definitely check out Boxers!!"
ki0jr4yDCmW5NFYKRMdxvA,5,"I love Your Helping Hands! I enjoyed their services so much, I wrote an article about them and put them on my website as a ""Top Pick"" of Las Vegas. Here it is below--

This is our top pick for house cleaning services in Las Vegas. They are thorough, dependable, and have successfully served the Las Vegas Valley since 1991. Even more, they use only safe and green products.

I've lived here two years and tried six different businesses. I've also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents. Don't be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services; you get what you pay for. Some places rush over things, some places break things, some places take things. Some use strong-smelling, toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward. Other places go through employees like air traffic controllers.  Once I was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp. At 2:25pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window. They walk in, pants pulled down showing their boxers, carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord. I say ""Sorry guys, not happening.""

Then one day I notice a shiny, practical, white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies. The car windows display a house cleaning advertisement/logo. Soon three industrious-looking women come bustling out my neighbor's apartment door, carrying vacuums and mops. I ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smile.

Next week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment. Before they arrive, Cindy, a co-owner and manager, gives me a courteousy call to check in. The three-women crew does an amazing job. Everything is swept, cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, washed, emptied, dusted, polished, picked up, put away, folded, and now shiny. And get this:  it smells fine, too, light and clear, no crazy chemicals. They use only safe and green products. A few minutes after the girls leave, Cindy calls again, making sure all went well.

I was so impressed I used them again. They did another stellar job.

So I decided Las Vegas Top Picks should have a top pick for housecleaning, too. I asked to meet the owners, Cindy and Bobby. One spring afternoon I visited their office; we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaning.

They told me some funny stories of celebrity clients. One individual had a large cougar in his garage, which often sat atop a 100K+ luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it. Since they've been in business for nearly 22 years, they have many such stories! Such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness. Bobby, the owner, takes pride in her work and good care of her ""girls"". Their website, which I hope you visit, further demonstrates this. It is comprehensive, professional, personal, and with a big clean heart. They work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications. In my experience, businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best service.

Also awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall. Was I in a secret CIA hub scouting the streets of Las Vegas? Or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping hands.

They even have a mascot - a cute friendly little dog named Bella.  

I believe it's important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money, doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis. For house cleaning Your Helping Hands is TOP in this town!

N_43wLNIKFCe9ai4B2nnLw,4,"Pros:
Quick seating
Friendly staff
Quick service
Great pizzas - really amazing crust

I'm not sure I'd go back. Everything was tasty and the atmosphere is great, but I'd rather go somewhere else for pizza."
7w4sdUJ4TI0VZmo6UbwyLA,5,Very cool older building with a lot of character.  I loved that they had free valet parking.  The restaurant was very busy but they squeezed in our party of 8 at the last minute.  Everyone loved their meals.  It was huge hit.  The staff are top notch.  We loved everything about this place.
fNvi2vWPK1yiAimzJe_xfw,5,"After careful consideration, I decided to give Master Engine Rebuilding a shot at rebuilding my motor. I was obviously hesitant given the amount of negative reviews in their past, but I was assured by the new owner that I would be taken care of. I was not let down! Thanks guys!"
-j8IFt5OsbOeZLb3qHCT-A,1,"Disgusting! This was at the bottom of my shake, how did this get there ?!?! This was my first time at Cook Out and I WOULD NEVER return here. This is unacceptable because there is no reason for this to be here somebody either had to notice the cup broke and did not care or I don't even know this just ruined my day."
hVXfjF5xmNKBAcE08z4zzw,2,"I was disappointed in both their veggie burger and onion rings.  Even Harvey's is way better. Harvey's is priced better too.  

Update Apr 2013 - I had there bacon burger and it was very good - not great...."
L8Qm9VXOOAA-NuP0DiHzxw,4,Cabana is the Wynn hotel's poolside eatery/bar.  The portions are sizable for the sandwiches and the bartenders make exceptional drinks. The pineapple mojito tastes great.
m-fk22T9ovRLNKkzUI7vtQ,3,The food here is pretty standard just like Chili's and TGIF. I eat here more than other burger restaurants mainly because of their royalty rewards card. I've already received about 4 free entrees as well as free appetizers and a free birthday burger. Other than that its just another mediocre American food family restaurant.
RxWzs1WPI5M27SMcCdotGA,5,"This place is awesome. I saw this place when driving and went in to check it out. HUGE selection of dog supplies at much cheaper prices than Petsmart and Petco. Aisles with shelves full of chew toys and treats and they also sell crates, beds, strollers, harnesses, leashes, and grooming supplies. Amazing prices. My dog is an aggressive chewer and can go through toys in 10 minutes so I stocked up on Kongs, Nylabones, and other durable toys as well as some treats for $25. I would have spent twice that at other pet supply stores. Check this place out for all your dog needs."
014DcJGEQl731gC-mLVc_A,5,"We went here with a group of vegans and omnivores, and everyone was thrilled with their dishes. The vegan options were plentiful and deliberate, no braised tofu or the dreaded ""vegetable stack"" passed off as an entree. They had great, thoughtful dishes - pot pie, 'meat'loaf, polenta cakes - yes please. We ordered one of each so we could all try them. The pot pie was rich and hearty, with an amazing pastry crust! The crispy oyster mushrooms were amazing, and a surprisingly large portion. The vegan Caesar salad was nothing special, certainly not next to the mushrooms. The bananas foster was one of the most flavorful desserts I've had in a while too. Of course, the place itself is gorgeous [as is most of the Encore]. There is great attention paid to artwork and details, not to mention the fact that the entire restaurant changes its walls and ceiling every 20 minutes or so, which is a beautiful spectacle to witness. There really is somehthng for everyone here, great for a pricey splurge in Vegas."
Mip1kLa0UtJJnbAFtAwOqg,3,"Awesome atmosphere and the wait staff was very friendly. The food was mediocre overall, however the Chicken Fired Chicken was a home run and the  desserts were monstrous which is wonderful! I would go again, but would not go out of my way."
ULWRPBq3jTDFztUa3fOjqA,3,I have been to the Pita Jungle in Chandler many times and loved it.  I love the Lentil Fetoosh Salad.  Tried the one in Gilbert and have to say was disappointed some.  Got the cheese and fruit platter and was served with molded cheese which makes me wonder about the quality at this location.  Server picked off the molded cheese and said is that good.  Also had the quesadilla which was excellent.  Service was good although the plentiful staff just sat around and watched you eat.  I am not sure I would go back to this location based on the mold but I will go back to other locations.
i1_UZsEa-Lk2QLBmwLtBng,4,"I'm very picky with sushi, and when I was out in this area of town, I decided to try it. I'm very glad I didn't read the Yelp reviews, because it seems most of the reviews are written by bitter customers who can't follow the simple AYCE rules of this restaurant. (Making sure you eat all the portion, without wasting the rice etc.)

The place is owned by a nice Korean family. I was pleased with how friendly they were, and the fish was very fresh. The price was right, and while I didn't get the AYCE, I spoke with them and found out that unlike other places, Sushi Boy doesn't place a time limit on your eating session. 

I would gladly return here if I'm in the area."
Xp_j560jduHjfaJWrLFFDA,5,"Have been coming here since they opened in the 80s. Love all the hard working staff here. Pharmacy is top notch. Produce is great. If you see an item, buy it then. May be gone by end of day. Some regular products do come and go. Products are fab, prices can't be beat. We have an executive membership and credit card and get back two rebate checks per year that more than pay for the fee ten times over. Gas is the best and cheapest in town. Wine/beer the same. I even own the stock! Cruises? You simply can't get a cheaper deal anywhere. Get an executive card then come shop early on Tues and Thurs. Many more benefits too! Love my Costco!"
0m3qQeZdVxCb-wAHHqbCag,2,"I keep wanting to like this place.  I want to support a local business, and yet....

Last year I took my two boys there after a theater performance (Greasepaint!   Excellent!), and after we placed our orders for lunch, I took out our SET game (it's a card game that does not use a traditional deck - great fun).  WIthin moments, the server was back at our table.  ""You can't do that.""  ""What?  Play cards?  It's not gambling."" (Maybe I was wrong, but living here, you start to assume that an objection to something must be religion based).  ""The owners don't allow it.""  ""They don't allow it?  It's a matching game.""  ""No.  You'll have to put it away.""

Now.  I would understand not wanting us to sit and play cards if we'd finished eating and were just holding a table (assuming it was busy).   However, this was during the gap between ordering and eating.  I KNOW I should've just left then.  Instead, I made my kids happy and we stayed for lunch (and ice cream!).  

A couple months ago I (foolishly) decided to try again.  Didn't bother with the cards this time.  The lousy thing this time was the mold on my son's bread.  They DID remove the sandwich from the bill, but eish.    

I'd kind of like the ""Restaurant Impossible"" guy to come in here and give it an overhaul.  I don't mind the nostalgia stuff, but the place does need a solid going over."
3h8fiHTi7-sPeCP2oXmO4Q,1,"I had been wanting to try this place for the longest time because of the self-serve beer idea. It sounded like a magical place where people gather, and the beer flows from waterfalls...however that is not the case. 

1. The taps are shit and immediately nullified our main reason for coming. You get charged for the amount of time you pull them, no matter how much beer actually comes out, and it's about 90% foam. One of the taps was actually empty and charged us around $15 when all it did was sputter. We notified a server who gave us a new card, but it was for $14 instead of checking how much we were actually charged for the error. They will say people don't know how to pour, but that's not true. Keg parties were my unofficial major in college. Everyone using the self-serve was laughing about how much of a joke it was.

2. The servers were not attentive. When we arrived, it was ""Please Seat Yourself"" and not busy at all. We went straight to the beer wall and waited several minutes before someone got us set up. Then we walked around to figure out where to sit. First we tried the patio and then moved inside. It was probably 15 or more minutes before a waitress made eye contact with us and came over. Most of the time, they are standing around talking to each other under the giant tree or by the soda machine. Food didn't take very long to arrive. We were waiting forever between times where we'd see our server, so I asked for our bill and some waters. She came back with just the bill.

3. Food was ok but nothing to rave about. I had a sampler, and my wife had the satay chicken skewers. The sampler needs a side of ranch to go with the buffalo wings.

4. We were trying to watch the Rams vs. Falcons game, but 2 douchey millennials came up on stage to sing and play their guitars during the game. It wasn't just during commercials or timeouts...it was during the game. We got the hell out of there."
S5FOG9exlyYX3JV46WhTgw,4,"Fantastic service and setting. In the cosmopolitan. 

They serve ramen only at lunch and late night. 

Menu is constantly changing."
mAGU8Uyl0XLnAB83hfZZXA,2,Not very friendly staff. Multiple people working and not one person greeted me or asked if I need any help. I'm huge with thrift stores and don't mind buying used clothes but this store had that gross smell to it. Not someplace I would come back to.
1ytTKvgrJq-a8OMcFwSEjg,4,"I can't say that I'm the most versed person when it comes to Thai food. Generally speaking, I like what's known as the ""white food."" At Thai Original BBQ I'm a big fan of their lunch specials. You get a great little side salad, then your main course for less than $9, not a bad deal.

So my staple item at this location is good ol' #1, the BBQ Chicken with Fried Rice. 90% of the time the chicken is moist, the skin has great flavor, and it's cooked to perfection. Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side. Periodically I'll go off the deep end and get the Pad Thai, which is decent, but I'm quickly reminded that nothing beats the BBQ chicken.

Definitely a good lunch stop, great prices, and quick service."
uKAM6GANIkjMxehks9LgKg,4,"we had yet another successful visit to Red Hawk last night. Thursday night for some reason is normally one of the busier nights.  We ended up sitting in the bar.  Normally we avoid the bar because we have kids, and there is a live band or music there. However it just seemed like a good place to sit you I think we were really missing with a fireplace. It would have been great fire going in there to really warm you up as playschool it cools down pretty fast once somebody open the front door. Wish list aside, we ordered our drinks kids got their hot chocolate and lemonade.

No I have not been reviewing too much as I have been counting my calories. However I find it if I make the right choices at Red Hawk I can still say well within my calorie budget. I ended up ordering a new sandwich off their menu called the chipotle chicken crunch. It's got these really thin onion rings with bacon cheese on top of a grilled Chicken sandwich and I believe there are jalapenos on there too. I did the math and calculated it out the whole sandwich runs about the same as a Big Mac. I deleted the fries and got a house salad on the side.  As far as comfort food goes if you are starving yourself during the week eating nothing but rabbit food this sandwich really hit the spot. I also ordered fish and chips for my son. He is 7 but obviously does not want to eat the whole adult portion so the kitchen is really cool and they will take whatever adult portion you find and turn it into a kids portion. So he's fish and chips came with to rather large fish sticks or fillets or whatever you call them. And of course fries and they managed to scrounge up some broccoli and green beans for him too. He was excited. What I did find out is that almost everything in this restaurant is made from scratch the balsamic vinaigrette for my salad scratch. There were salad dressings were also from scratch. French fries are fresh cut, and nothing tastes like its been sitting in a freezer for 3 months. I think they've really stepped up their game up and every employee in there is invested in seeing the place do better"
V2BHg3BVlR1kl_cHi9GO0Q,3,"As others have already pointed out in previous reviews, everything is there for this restaurant, except for food quality... and also maybe that it is located in a sketchy plaza with a dirty looking sex shop.  As for the food, I'd rather get a quarter size of their portions and more flavour.  The dishes were either overly salty or incredibly bland.  The pasta was cooked very well, but it lacked what some would describe as passion and love for the food itself.  My seafood fettuccine had seafood in it, but it just didn't have the seafood flavour.  Perhaps the seafood was from frozen, or the cream sauce didn't have any seafood juices in it.

The service was great though, she managed a large group of us and helped us pack our food and out the door in a timely manner.  It made for an acceptable turn-around time for a lunch outing during work hours."
BHd0UuXJ3x0GI60mQ6u5eg,3,"It's okay pizza but the fries are really good with the homemade ranch.  Other than that nothing really special, the pizza is thin and okay, it fits a perfect 3/5."
g1COxGrss_h4tV4C-oS25w,5,"If you have kids, this place is a NE Ohio gem and a 'must visit' for a fun, farm experience!  I took my 8 year old daughter to Mapleside for the first time today, and she had a total blast for the 4 hours we were there!  The place was a bit crowded when we got there at 130PM, but there was more than ample parking across the street in a grassy lot (I hear weekends can be way too crowded, with long lines, especially around Halloween and if the weather is nice).  Police were there as well, directing pedestrians and traffic for safety (liked that).  This place is a huge, 100 acre or so family farm, with a gift shop, bakery, restaurant, snack stands, and concession stands.  There are many attractions for kids, since the focus is on them here.  Today, Friday was half price, and we got to walk through 2 really cool corn mazes (an amazing maize maze!), go on hayrides through endless orchards, tractor pulled kiddie cars in the shape of a pig or cow, go down a long slide that winds down a hill, walk through a pumpkin patch and pick pumpkins, jump on a huge inflatable in-ground air trampoline, go inside a tepee, and play in the park there.  The BEST part was when my little sweetheart hugged me 'out of the blue' as we were leaving and said ""dad, I had the best time today!  Can we come back again?""  ""Of course we can beautiful... OF COURSE WE CAN!"""
lYDOpg_H8MXrC5Av7RG-bA,4,"My boyfriend and I couldn't decide on a place for a burger, but we finally settled on Bricco because I had a memory of a good meal a couple years ago. Showed up to the same cozy environment I remember, but WOW have they improved the menu and the food! Their menu is full of endless customizations for burgers and sandwiches, with plenty of unique, yet solid appetizer and entree options. 

I had their salmon with veggies and rice, my boyfriend had the lamb burger, and we split an order of the Rosemary fries.

The table next to us got their food much quicker than us, even though we ordered first, and we received our fries at the same time as our meal which was a little disappointing.

But once we tasted the feast set before us, service wasn't a thought in our minds. The salmon was impressive for a little pub like this. Tender and flavorful, and paired wonderfully with the perfectly cooked veggies. His lamb burger was, in his words, a solid burger that makes him want to go back to try a regular hamburger. 

My favorite part of the meal, though, were the rosemary fries with parmesan dipping sauce. Perfectly crispy on the outside, with a melt-in-your-mouth inside. Not greasy! The rosemary combined with the parmesan was out of this world.

Service wasn't excellent, but due to the quiet (for a pub) ambiance, and of course great food, I will definitely be returning!"
NbJELh7JUDTy3ql30u29LQ,5,"The fast food playing field is changing drastically. The era of fast food chains getting away with serving mediocre food cooked in greasy oil with impersonal service in a sterile environment designed to get you in and out is facing intense competition from the newer generation of fast food chains. This new generation of fast food chains is being led by Shake Shack, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. 

   After hiking in Calico Basin and the streets of Downtown Summerlin, my brother and I were up for a post-hike dinner in Shake Shack. I had been looking forward to biting into a Smokestack burger. In recent times, I had visited Shake Shack four times and  developed an appreciation for their Smokeshack burger. 

   Just like downtown Summerlin is the future of the regional shopping mall, Shake Shack is the future of the fast food restaurant. My experience describes dining in a futuristic fast food restaurant. After ordering from the menu on the wall (not over a counter), the friendly cashier presented me with a beeper. Instead of waiting by a counter for other people, or hearing order numbers go off, the gentle buzz of a beeper went off when the food was ready. The dining room is an environment that encouraged me to relax. This is totally disparate from a sundry of the fast food restaurants walled with plate glass windows overlooking the highway where the psychological message has been to eat up and get back on the road. In Shake Shack the interior feels more like a casual full service restaurant than a fast food restaurant. From my table I overlooked a couple of close caption HD TV sets playing football and ""Shriek."" If it was a warm day, I could of sat outside in the patio overlooking the beautiful arroyo park in downtown Summerlin. Whether I sat inside or outside, there was an employee offering to dump my garbage. And if I really wanted to relax, instead of a Coke with my crinkly fries, I could have enjoyed a draft beer. Biting into a Smokestack burger was more than enough to make me relax. 

    Shake Shack has been consistent with quality. In similar fashion to the past three visits the Smoke Shack burger elevated my taste buds. That 100% angus beef between two soft buns were the delicious prime ingredients that complimented Applewood bacon, red peppers, and that mysterious Shake Shack sauce. The crinkly cut fries were good but not Nathan's greatness. 

   It seems that Las Vegans including yours truly Daniel. S love Shake Shack. But Shake Shack is doing a Winco business strategy where they build a couple of restaurants that require  people to drive a distance to come to them. Currently the only other Las Vegas location is in New York - New York. 

  Speaking of New York - New York, I want to clarify a major Shake Shack misconception. There is a misconception that Shake Shack is the IN N Out Burger of New York and they are all over the New York metropolitan area. Not true at all. I grew up in New York and never heard of them. Throughout my young adulthood there was a few locations in the city. Only recently did they expand to the Suffolk County suburbs of New York. They are totally different from IN N Out. Shake Shack goes for around $12 where In N Out is about half the price. Shake Shack offers several different items where In N Out offers a few. From growing up in New York, I feel thar White Castle would be comparable to IN N Out.

  On the other hand what is the antithesis of a misconception is that Shake Shack is fantastic. With all the four star reviews including this one, it is foreseeable to walk into this futuristic fast food restaurant and set eyes on the ""People Love Us on Yelp""  sticker."
WuM8QvCqrBlBkw4-MIxupg,5,"After 40+ years of driving, I had my first fender bender. Ashamed to even drive my car, I found Colorpoint through the Toyota dealer in Henderson. Luis Bravo, manager took really good care of my car. My car is 10 years old and it literally looks new again. I would highly recommend Colorpoint to anyone looking for incredible workmanship/quality and probably the fairest pricing around. Dont let the non glamorous office fool you, these guys are professional all the way. I hope I never have to use them again, but if I do I will."
0UG7dKoDilaXwiuCQr2tLg,2,"We were disappointed by this place. The pastries, (which we walked a decent distance just to try, hearing that they were some of the best in Mtl) were dry and hard. Myself and my fiancé tried the blueberry Danish, a regular croissant, chocolate croissant and an almond chocolate croissant and all were dry except for the Danish, which was the clear winner of the group. The filling was delicious and the pastry wasn't dried out and hard like the others. The coffee was pretty good, not the best, and the tables in the sitting area upstairs were a little messy, but to be fair they looked extremely busy! I probably wouldn't return, we had better pastries in other non-bakeries in Montreal!"
ydBbqSu89uFIVqjGUEVq1A,2,"My wife and I visited Dubina Brewing Co on a Sunday and had a late afternoon beer and meal. My wife ordered the flight of five different beer selections, while I ordered the Bell road IPA.  I enjoyed my IPA, and the aroma was very pleasant; while the flavor and drinkability was average.  I tried each of the flights with my wife and noticed the following:  The Sours were very sour (good job!), the hefeweizen had the typical cloudy banana aroma and flavor, the Gose and amber also had all the characteristics of their respective types.

I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered a burger.  My meal was subpar and the fish was not cooked completely and heavily battered.  This was disappointing.  My wife said her burger was OK and cooked a little darker than the medium she requested.  In short, the food leaves a lot to be desired.

The service was slow.  After finishing our meal, we waited for 15+ minutes for the waitress to take payment.  We were the only group in the bar, minus a group of patrons there for what appeared to be a painting class.

On the whole, it was nice to visit a new local brewery in Phoenix.  I am not sure if we will return or if I will search out their beer however.   For the typical bar food and beer, this place fits the bill."

T1OrVGkEqQ8XuyJMnHIFnA,4,"Have been here several times but never posted a review. My first visit would have been a 1 star due to the horrible service. I asked the waiter what the special was and he replied ""uh...I think maybe chicken?"". After ordering the chef came to our table and when I explained what had happened he informed me the special was an orange roughy with risotto. Needless to say I changed my order. The second would be a 3, again due to service, because our main course came before our appetizer, although the food was excellent. This last time was great! Excellent service, excellent food, just great!"
16PrPFvY93LOYmM0914ByA,5,"I've  been going to eat here since they first open their first location on Green Valley Parkway. The food is absolutely amazing! The meets are juicy, the salmon melts in your mouth and all the ingredients are super healthy. It's definitely a family favorite of ours!"
ZVJhjVQnnj4M0AQecu2ytA,4,"Went during restaurant week in July. Great food. Great atmosphere. Comfortable but nice.  Pleasant staff.  Whenever we requested specific meats, they ensured they quickly came. Cheese bread.. to die for. My boyfriend and I were quite happy with everything."
nec7peI001rFeEwiIr5XkA,2,I rarely go to this location because their drive thru line ups move terribly slow regardless of the size of their line up.   BUT I wanted a decaf coffee and it was super early in the morning on a Sunday so I figured that it would likely be a quiet time to use their drive thru.  While the line only consisted of one car in front of me it took FOREVER for the customer to get his 4 coffees.    The service at the payment window was terribly slow and I actually rolled down my window and suggested that the gentleman move forward to the pick up window to pay.  He was about to do so but a human actually appeared at the window after all!   I paid for my coffee and received a Luke warm coffee with incorrect mixings.  I ended up having to go inside and give my order to the cashier again.  She brought me a fresh cup of black coffee that was same deal...room temp!   I requested my $ back.  Lesson learned on my part and go figure that this location has the reputation in Mississauga as being the WORST for order accuracy and drive thru efficiency.  Thankfully none of my children like McDonalds food and I only go there for the odd coffee.
r2FT8uXOpEsvgEKVJnpbBg,4,"We get take out from Sunset once every two weeks the crust is perfect and they don't over do it with the sauce.  If you want thick crust and heavy sauce go back to Chicago, this is NY style pizza.  
The take out/eat in special is now a $9.99 large cheese, it was a one topping.  economy I guess...  Still great for the price."
XykWJCqtpNlcmCTL5Pyy6w,4,"Great drinks, great staff, great vibes. There's a bar, a game room, a little cozy library vibe, and a dance floor. Something for whatever you like. A good clientele mix, wasn't stacked full of trashy 21 year old college students. Will be going back regularly."
WaiLAgFiLXzLXazxWqgOug,5,"We always ask for gift cards to this place during Christmas for our Vegas trips. It's nestled inside Planet Hollywood Hotel, where you can see the slot machines and what not from the bar. We've only sat at the bar. So this review is for the bartenders, who are great! 

Hands down my favorite thing on the menu: Chicken or Vegetarian Lettuce Wraps. Pear Mojitos. And the steamed dumplings. 

They have a killer happy hour. Awesome service. Nice bartenders. Comfy chairs."
-bizFU0PqFCqoRD5_oazDA,1,"Le Mont just lost $30,000 tonight.

Me, my fiancé, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fiancé paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: ""Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass."" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: ""Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more."" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fiancés mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: ""You sure you don't want nuttin?"" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was ""beautifully garnished"" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. ""Yes, I love lemon with my coffee."" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no ""have a good night, thank you for coming, etc"" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.

JUST GOOGLE THE VIEW."

eFWukMrrsaPfiuFHLT6PBA,1,"I've been using this dealership for 2 years now. First with my used car for oil changes; then I bought a new car from them and have been using them for regular maintenance and the warranty repairs. There are several reasons why I feel the service for Toyotas should be outsourced:

1. This dealership does not want you to come back for service, they have no incentive to provide quality service. This is reflected in the failure to repair items the first time and the employee callus response when you tell them the vehicle has been there for this simple repair previously. There is absolutely no accountability and they just don't care.

2. Expect to wait 4+ hours for something simple like an oil change or just changing out a light bulb. It doesn't matter if you're paying cash, have a financed maintenance plan or are in for a warranty repair. This is a problem they could fix by having longer hours during the weekend when it is most busy; but instead they close at 5 on Saturday and don't open at all on Sunday. If you have a problem outside those hours, there is no one to help you. The sales department manager won't even answer his phone or call you back. The roadside assistance is a joke. If you make it through the myriad of phone prompts, expect to have all kinds of problems getting someone to you.

3. They won't do all services and their recommended Vendor for windshield repair/replacement installed my windshield twice where I could push the glass out afterward. Took 3 separate visits to get the glass actually touching the glue. -- I had a 8 inch crack, got it replaced, had to get up charged for the Toyota glass, didnt touch the glass at all, but could feel the wind coming through it on the freeway. Took two more visits before the tech just pushed on the glass and said ""there's the problem"" displaying the obvious gap. Smh.

4. Once they have your vehicle in service they have no incentive to get it back to you. So you may go days without a car with no notice. -- They  do have a courtesy shuttle when they are open; but you may wait 3+ hours after it is scheduled to pick you up. 

5. They can't get Toyota parts same day even if you've made an appointment in advance and they know the issue. It's usually 3 days to a week and then you get to come back when the parts arrive and start the process all over again. One time, they told me they would call me when the part arrived, a month later I called them and found out it had arrived they held it and then they returned it. So I had to wait again for them to reorder the part. Another time I had to leave my car there while they could troubleshoot with corporate, which is only weekdays. So that was another day without my car, and more rides.

Normally I'm very understanding of a busy day at the dealership and I was excited to have a standard new vehicle that would be easy to repair.  -- but this service department destroys the reliable and easy to work on reputation of Toyota by making regular maintenance a nightmare.

 This time its just the side mirror interior part that broke and 2nd time in on the same brake light replaced. This will be my last visit here. I just don't have the time for this nonsense. 

I remember the 90's well, when Jiffy Lube had all the parts and could do my service, replace my windshield wipers and break lights in under an hour. I don't know what happened to the auto repair industry or where I will take my Toyota now. I am seriously considering trading it in for a Honda just so I can take it anywhere for service."
BjyDoCvNIm1UlrS1nbI69w,5,"We did the couples massage and everything was perfect: impeccable service, nice facility, attention to detail, and very relaxing massage. We are definitely coming back!"
K75uRHH5BTL9MDySLJpNpw,3,"I had an appointment for a 90 minutes hot stone massage on the afternoon of March 11, and unfortunately, I was highly disappointed and certainly won't return. First, it didn't start until 15 minutes after my appointment time. Had it run 15 minutes longer, I wouldn't have cared, but it only lasted 75 minutes. By 10 p.m. (my massage was scheduled for 4:30 p.m.), I had a huge red burn, including at least three blisters, on my torso because a stone was too hot. While I was told to let the massage therapist know if it was too hot, when I did say something, apparently it was too late. I wouldn't be so upset, but before the stone was placed on my torso, the massage therapist said, ""This one might be a little hot."" If she, a trained massage therapist thought the stone might be too hot, I can't understand why it was placed on me. (This was my first (and likely last) hot stone massage, and the therapist was aware of this before the massage began.)  When I woke up this morning, which was 15 hours after the massage, I noticed that I also have a burn on my back.  I like to see local businesses succeed, but I definitely won't be recommending this place to anyone.

UPDATE:  I just spoke with Aaron, the owner, who was incredibly apologetic and refunded my money.  He also offered me a free massage. I don't doubt that this most likely is a good place to go for a massage (very clean, and the folks that work there seem to be really nice and easy going), but because of my own personal experience, I won't recommend it."
Y38TCaFrH9uF4XrLjlDlxw,1,Went there for my first time yesterday and had 2 carne aside tacos and thought it looked and tasted a little funky but wasn't sure. Felt sick last night and woke up this morning drenched in sweat. My boyfriend and I both got food poisoning. Still feel sick and wish I would have never eaten there.
dOcSOm2MtSxiIUBZx4S-nQ,5,"Great food and fabulous service. The food was hot and delicious. They were busy, but my server kept the drinks full and made sure that we were taken care of. We tipped 25% and wished that I could have given more!"
eQLFx5FCGBM7c4CFgjrECA,5,"I love both sushi and burgers!!! If you are looking for a place to have one or the other or both, this is the place for you!!! You can't go wrong eating inside, outside or at the bar. You will be well served. I started off my Valentine's Day dinner with 2 appetizers. The lobster/crab spring rolls and calamari were both delicious!!! They also take pride in the presentation as well. I was in the mood for sushi but decided to get a burger for the main because of my seafood appetizers. Too many awesome burgers to choose from!!!! I ordered the Texas Burger with the jalapeño bacon and other mouth watering toppings. This place forces you to come back because if it wasn't hard enough choosing what you want to have for dinner, the variety of desserts.........Find out for yourself!!!"
L-BNh17UAYIRrH_UlSeDNA,1,This place has mediocre beer and disgusting food. Nothing is fresh. The wings are tasteless and the birds nest might as well be bird food. It went right from my parties table and into the garbage. Please don't go here!
uBeO2X3MnifdImzwDrTAqg,5,"Just got my kitchen counter tops done and they are absolutely gorgeous! Fábio, Cesar and Ellen did an amazing job! From beginning to end they were professional and patient with me as I had some kitchen delays due to my kitchen installer being late on the project. 

It was an easy and enjoyable process! The finish of the slab is beautiful. They also left everything clean once they left. 

Thank you Fabio, Ellen and Cesar! We loved working with you!

My kitchen backsplash is not done yet, but I will attach some photos so you can see their beautiful slab."
xBYMiVPQAg7An3fqKmGtUg,2,"Dentonia is a challenging course only because it is partly a hiking trip. I was lugging around my pull cart UP and DOWN and UP and DOWN.... for every single hole... 

They do NOT have cart rentals available, which is shocking - considering at how slopy this course was. The slopes are also what makes this par 3 course difficult. Your short game will really mess you up, or maybe it's just me. 

I went in early October, and there were so many leaves on the green, putting was almost impossible. I brushed the leaves away from my putting line, and WHOOSH the wind will blow more over. (repeat for all 18 holes) 

There is a vendor selling drinks on a golf cart that comes around once in awhile, I think they should hire someone to maintain the greens instead. 

There were a few holes that we needed to tee off on this beaten up mat. I agree with everyone else - they need to have those replaced. 

I don't think it's worth it to pay $27.00 per person to play on a poorly maintained course. I'm guessing that's the price they can charge for being 'in the city' and right beside Victoria Park TTC Station. 

There are much better/well maintained golf courses outside the GTA that charge at a cheaper price. So, for those who own a vehicle, you're better off elsewhere!"
06r3ZCauqYZRjx4D_1YRtA,2,"I was definitely not impressed with this place, and I'm even less pleased that we get this sub-par ""grocery store"" in the sure to be awesome CityScape.  After spending a summer in Washington, I think I was expecting this place to be like a pared down Thriftway.  I was expecting lots of gourmet items and other fun stuff.  Well, it's true they have lots of gourmet items, but it's pretty much limited to wine and olive oil with some cheese and already prepared foodstuffs in between.  The layout of the store was extremely frustrating.  Despite the store being large enough to theoretically hold 30 customers quite adequately, the layout created all sorts of traffic jams and line convergences.  It was really annoying to say the least.  We didn't buy anything because of what looked like a mile long line.  I do have to say though, that I was particularly interested in a jar of some gray sea salt.  That's about it.  Maybe another time."
63o20mOvGzPILhwcklJIZQ,1,Waited in line for over 1 hour and they do not take reservations on busy days but somehow this gentleman who is the owners son happens to bring  5  friends in And bypass a long lineup . I am still in line waiting. !!! Jan 15 8:17 pm ... Poor service and no respect for loyalty of customers !! Last time ! Only staying cause I waited an hour
hUJRp60d44zYC5oHewESDA,4,Great brunch spot. Ohio city has a wealth of brunch places but the majority of them are a bit overpriced for what you get. This place however is as good or not better than the other options and also modestly priced. It's a little on the small side as far as room but we had no problem getting a spot and it fits the French cafe style pretty well.
nFBLu8pkUnkIkJEDsDHJ4Q,3,"The only reason I'm got giving them a one is because the serve was nice and the manager was very accommodating. I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was extremely salty and the cesar salad was drenched in dressing. My dad ordered the clam chowder soup and it tasty bland there was no real flavor. My sister in law ordered the lobster artichoke dip and she said it tasted like mayo. But as always the cheddar bay biscuits were warm and delicious. We won't, however be back anytime soon."
GDM_oFkDN3EJrg8PfQblCA,5,This gym is AWESOME. I recently switched from the ATF in Lancaster because of poor customer service and I am so happy I made the change.

Switching here was the best decision ever.

4fsxhDPwi_0_PNsMqv9c0g,5,I went to I AM Mechanics for the first time last week and I was very pleased with the service I received. I brought the car in with no appointment and they had it ready the same day. They kept me updated on any additional labor/parts that were needed and gave me different pricing options. Both Saul and Noe were very friendly and knowledgeable. I highly recommend!

n5YnfY8g2n-UkEE0aDsw1w,4,"My boyfriend and I discovered this place a few years ago and we've been a fan since! Sencha was formerly steepery fyi! 

The baristas there are really helpful! They know great combos for different tea flavors so if you're stuck definitely ask! So far my boyfriend and I have tried taro bubble tea , black lemon ice tea, and black milk tea. After having the black lemon ice tea with lychee bubbles I'm never going back! It's the perfect amount of sour and the lychee compliments the lemon so well!! The taro bubble tea is milky and the boba is pretty good! I always try to swing by to grab some tea!

The interior changed as well! They added a booth which adds more seating and it improves the overall look of the cafe. It's quite small so sometimes there's no seating. They also sell local art as well as tea accessories!

I'm a fan! Hope you guys like it too! :)"
pbflAYNWiQKwTLVN_6r4Gg,5,"This is beyond the most incredible resort I have ever stayed at. Can't wait to come back! I went here for a quick staycation over the weekend for my anniversary and I couldn't ask for anything more special. The beauty of the resort and the service I received from every single staff member was Incredible! 

Check in is normally at 4pm but I called that morning and the staff was very kind over the phone and found an available room so we were able to check-in at 12pm. All parking is valet so you pull up, and the bell hops will help unload your car and direct you to check in desk. The staff was so nice checking us in and then even greeted us with a fresh glass of champagne. Our bell hop walked us to our room and even explained a little history about the resort. Like it used to be a home in 1922. 

The rooms are large and beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a large double shower head walk in shower. We also had a free Keurig in the room and a private patio. My favorite part was the bed! It was so fluffy and felt like a cloud! Best sleep of my life! They do a turn down service at night so they come in and turn down bed sheets, give chocolates, and close the curtains so your ready for bed. We received a gift of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for our anniversary when we got back to the room. Such a romantic evening. 

This is a very beautiful historic Spanish style resort so very little kids which is nice for a special romantic occasion. There is multiple courtyards that all look different so it's gorgeous to just walk all the pathways and explore. Beautiful lit up at night. There is benches, tables, games, waterfalls, and fruit trees all over the property. Great large pool and jacuzzi which is open 24-7 so you can go anytime at night when it's less busy. They do have a great poolside bar and it's pretty packed during the day. 

Check-out was at 12pm but they are very accommodating so just a quick call down to front office they let us know we can check out at 1pm which allowed us more time to relax in the morning. We ordered breakfast in bed of pancakes and a fried egg sandwich which were both amazing! 

Overall everything from start to finish was amazing. Such a beautiful resort to stay at for a romantic evening and the staff made our stay so special. I'm very excited to come back, if not sooner, at least for our anniversary next year. Next time I want to try the famous T Cooks restaurant on property that I herd great things from. 

Thank you Hyatt and royal palms for making our anniversary so special!"
mBEFKPJm88ai5DuR71-_fw,1,"After 4 years of going to Los Olivos, I said good-bye. As many have mentioned, the inconsistency in work is not worth the money or time for us. The last three times answered my question to management - do you want my business? I finally took a stand and had the manager walk with me as I showed him the dust on the windows, seats and streaks on the dash. The second time I complained enough that they ran the car through again. Today, (my truck was at the front of a long line), I asked the young man for a towel and spray bottle. At least 3 customers watched me as I cleaned the inside of my car...each of them calling the manager and showing him the same thing I showed him...poor work. I wish Los Olivos the best. I drove 5 miles out of my way but I am in search of a new place. Farewell, 4 yr. friend."
6QYyUFDRHjC5Jf9KJf5FZg,5,"My husband took me here for my birthday along with two friends.  It was my first Bobby Flay experience and so I was looking forward to it.  I had little expectations just because it's in a hotel and I didn't know how Tex Mex would be in a casual fine dining atmosphere.  

The restaurant's atmosphere is great.  It's bright and welcoming.  This place is busy so definitely make reservations.  

We showed up early and we were told that they wouldn't be able to seat us until our reservations (completely fine), so we left and came back about 3 minutes before our reservation.  They were behind a little.  10 minutes pass and the host let us know that she didn't foret about us but tables were turning slow (loved that she acknowledged us) and then after another 5-10 minutes she came up to us and said that the restaurant would be buying us drinks for the wait (okay!) we sat about a half hour after our reservation and they immediately sent us out an appetizer to again apologize.  I was impressed with how they handled it.  I worked as a host for years and was happy to see that these hosts worked the front so well.

After we sat down we were greated by our server and started ordering our food.  Everything came out perfectly from the corn bread to the filet mignon.  The rock shrimp tamale was oh so good!  I am not a Rib Eye fan but the flavor of the cut was so good!  I also had the duck pancake.  I would have eaten those all night.  I would stray from the double baked potato and get the corn if they have it on the menu as a side.  It was like eating candy (not sweet, just you don't want to stop eating it!) 

The chef's in the kitchen are trained to perfection.  People it's NOT Bobby Flay cooking your steak and it's not him making your menu!  Give credit where credit is deserved!  A lot of people don't realize it's just his name and face sometimes but his executive chef's and sous chefs do a lot of the grunt work and creativity! The presentations were beautiful as well.

And I can't forget the backwaits.  Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were whisked away silently and we were never bumped into when they were clearing other tables (even though the tables are very close together).

The prices of the food and drinks are expensive but what do you expect?  Other than the quality being top notch you are in Caesars eating at Bobby Flay.  If you don't like a perfectly cooked filet at $44 then go to Denny's.  I think they have a $2.99 special from midnight to 6am.

This was a great meal. I would tell anyone going to vegas to try this place because you will not be disappointed!  I love seeing other foodies enjoy this place as much as I did!"

sko6oyYNcU07JcHWJd_w6Q,1,"Worst online order experience EVER. I ordered 2 bags of flour, i paid $48 including shipping. Never shipped called 2 weeks later they acted like they had no clue what i was talking about promised to ship it, the shipment got lost, after multiple phone calls and A rude staff and a whole month of trying to get the flour i paid for I drove down there to pick it up. I finally thought they made it right. Got home and realized the flour was packaged in much smaller bags and was not given what i paid for. Went back online to double check and they evidently removed that service. End result I paid $48 for about 3lbs of flour and had to drive a 45 min drive after paying shipping costs. Will NEVER return. Lost my business and all recommendations. The staff hangs up on you and refuses to communicate."
6t-RF2DYzEQQGryOiEHFWA,4,"Having never actually been to Philly I can't vouch for the authenticity of these cheesesteakes.

What I can vouch for is their supreme deliciousness. I ordered mine with ""The Works"" (shaved steak, provolone, onions, mushrooms, green peppers, topped with cheese whiz) and DAMN BITCH, that's a tasty sang-wich! Slightly greasy, rather messy, and so good.

The friendly staff also offered us a free sample of their new creation...fried boneless chicken coated with crunchy frosted-flake breading smothered in sweet/spicy sauce. Awesome!

I'll be back to Philly, fo sho."
OIGE0AvK7ZT3BVbMEDtDSw,2,"Food was good.  However, service was a bit slow.   Our server tonight was joey.

The entire process from the time I walked in to the time I left was absolutely great! I wasn't exactly sure which bike I wanted - and the owner let me test ride one in the parking lot to see how I liked it.

Once I selected one he adjusted the seat to my height and helped load the bike in the car. The owner was incredibly helpful and very nice!! 

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great bike!"
TpuVqQjn7vpeETSfnU8U7Q,4,"Came here for dim sum and ordered the $45 a head set menu. Yes, it's $45 a person, I know. Get over it. It's a creative menu with extra touches you don't get in any standard Chinese dim sum selection. Wagyu beef, chunks of lobster, truffles, etc. 


Shredded Peking Duck and enoki mushrooms in a thick soup flavored with finely shredded conpoy.

Steamed lobster dumpling stuffed with shrimp mousse & finely diced vegetable flavored with garlic.

Steamed scallop, shredded dried conpoy & white fungus in dumpling. 

Steamed dumplings of Waygu beef accompanied with thinly sliced Waygu beef, in chili oil.

Deep-fried roll of mixed vegetable & assorted mushrooms.

Deep-fried taro root paste dumpling filled with shredded chicken.

Truffle & lobster escalopes on crispy egg noodles flavored with truffle scented oil.

Chinese dessert - this was a dan tat and a steamed red bean stuffed rice skin ball type of item.

Obviously you don't go to a fancy dancy Chinese restaurant and order the same-old same-old as all dim sum places when you can have something besides that. There is a tea menu as well but you can order more standard teas as well for less. I ordered Tiguanyin (not part of the tea menu), it was alright but definitely not a tiguanyin I would buy by itself. We enjoyed every item on our tasting menu and actually left quite full. They speak Chinese and English perfectly fine, and it's easy to converse in both together. Easily the best Chinese food we had in Toronto, this being our first time there and unable to get out to the burbs where I hear there is more dim sum to be had. And a MUCH better way to spend $100 than stupid Bier Markt, so there!"
siGNY2g16xAHDMQh62CvlA,5,"All hail the yellow pancake! For you are filled with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts! As Tonya instructed, I will fill you with cilantro, basil and homemade hot sauce!!! I will then spend the next 15 minutes moaning out loud and making other diners feel extremely uncomfortable or highly intrigued as I consume you in a gluttonous onslaught!!

The staff is a well-oiled smiling machine! The food is incredible! Garlic tofu is king!

All hail the yellow pancake! That is all. Carry on!!"
TYh6EP9XfldfQaMchzChsA,4,I got one of those promotional time share invites and stayed at the resort for 4 days. It was much nicer than expected. The resort is condo style and we had basically a 2 bedroom apartment. It was off the strip but Lyft is so cheap to travel around the price difference is worth it. They also have free shuttles. Having a full kitchen and living room is nice also. There was some construction noise in the morning. But it wasnt coming from the resort. They are developing all around Vegas so it is hard not to be near construction. For the most part it was much quieter than I expected from a Vegas resort.
51nLIv2ZYT6j4WEB1vl7bg,1,"Interesting concept, but just wasn't our thing. Underwhelmed, food was lukewarm.  Completed forgot what we ordered!"
cdk8KWpXWoEVw1VexLWvwQ,5,I am from New Mexico and this is as close to home as I've ever tasted! The food is delicious the staff is amazing and the ambience is welcoming and inviting.
5M8SfaEdQVHcXRHdmzT19Q,1,"Another place I just don't get....the cupcakes are certainly no better than anything you would find at your local grocery. They look pretty but the cake was dry and more importantly, the frosting was horrible! Overly sweet and, to reiterate, tasted like something you'd find at a supermarket. Don't waste your time and money."
8ycCfM7tCO-if0_eif92YA,4,"I stopped in for a quick sampling of some of the beers offered at Banger Brewing.  Since a ""flight"" (four, 5 oz. pours) was only $8.00, I thought it was the best way to go.  Here's what I sampled:

El Hefe - You can instantly smell the jalapeño coming off the head, which is a very light one that dissipates quickly, so enjoy it while it lasts.  The beer starts like a hefeweizen and leaves a slight jalapeño heat on the back of your tongue to finish that disappears just as soon as your tongue picks it up.  This is a great beer if you like hefs and enjoy spicy things (I do).

Ba-Dunkle - Not very aromatic at all, ditto for head (where most the aroma comes from). It is a smooth, wheaty beer though. Not anything great, but a solid beer. It was my least favorite of the four.

Chocolate Victory - The head was nice and thick, and held up longer than the other four pours. This beer has a definite ""chocolate"" look (color) with toasty notes coming off the head. The nice toasty malt taste is balanced with just the right amount of hop bitterness. It had a creamy but smooth mouth feel. This was my favorite of the four.

Black Eye P.A. - Had some fruity hop notes off the head which contrasts nicely against  the dark color (you don't expect a beer that dark to smell that fruity). Both thick and creamy, it is just bitter enough to balance all that malt and not overly hoppy. I'm must say I'm not a fan of unimaginative IPAs, but I do love black IPAs because they have more character, and this is one has to be one of the best I've had.

They do sausages out front (different company) if you get hungry.  There is plenty of bar seating and table seating as well.  I know most people wanna walk up and down Fremont making noise, drinking macro-brews, and acting a fool.  I like sitting down at the end of Fremont, sipping my craft brew, relaxing to some good music and company.

I'll definitely be back for more (and I'm taking a growler of that Chocolate Victory home)."
mVodRiFDlUXox4Hi7mtWVQ,3,"Our visit to Rock Bottom was a very nice to way to end a day of travel into Charlotte.  A tasty meal, a good beer, and a nice place? Check ,check and check.. almost.

The food was good, but nothing incredibly memorable. The asiago artichoke and crab dip appetizer was very tasty, but our burgers were nothing special.  I ordered their house beer, which had a nice flavor to it and went well with the food.

The restaurant itself has a nice brewhouse/restaurant atmosphere to it.  Servers were quite nice, and the service was prompt and efficient.  Personal tip: the outside patio is great during the daytime to watch the activity of downtown Charlotte, but after it gets dark, the people walking around get a lot sketchier.  Since your tables are next to the sidewalk, some of the nighttime folks may start messing with you.  Be warned.

Overall, though, this was a nice place to go and wouldn't mind going here again."
U99a8buYq1_bygFmIXaMYw,3,"My friend and I met here for some hot beverages. Though a quaint little shop, there is minimal seating, so take out would be the best option. We found a small counter in the back that was secluded and allowed us to catch up. I ordered a small chai latte and the price was outrageous! The drink wasn't anything special. The barista and other employees were on their phones a lot behind the counter which appeared unprofessional. 

With several local coffee shops around, I'll give others a try before I consider returning here."
sFks6pfP3dj4O4btI3wV9w,3,"We went to this place on a Friday night around 7:30 PM. We had a reservation. When we arrived it was not busy, but by 9 PM it was packed. We got the sausage pizza and Calamari to share between 2 people. The pizza was good, the Calamari was a little too sweet for my taste. 
Overall it is a nice place to hang out with friends."
COSZqaruA4uS4rnbkSOVXw,5,"Daves is really my love hate relationship. I ADORE having a food store this large in selection (can foods) within a few blocks of my house. I LOVE that they have a relatively good selection of meats, breads, canned goods. I LOVE that they are open when the market is not (because i can only get to the market on fridays and weekends- work schedule). 

I hate the costumer service i have gotten there EVERY single time. Especially in the Deli- prepare to wait a LONG time. I HATE that they have prices that are MUCH HIGHER THEN the west side market, the Athens Stores right around the bend and MUCH higher then anywhere else in the city. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HOW CRUMMY, and OLD, and CRAPPY their produce is. its A given that everything you buy will go bad VERY soon- much sooner then it should. Even within few days- and that is hard for someone who LOVES to cook Fresh.  They hold produce and fruit, on the shelf passed when most stores would not.  i have been so upset by the veggies and fruits that i have bought there, i actually started driving 20 mins down 90 to get to the Giant Eagle where EVERYTHING is cheaper, and FRESH IS FRESH. 

I love it and hate it. I can get anything i need last min in a recipe, but i hate going there. But i love supporting local store owners, so if i could choose, i would always go to the market. But sometimes you can't"
hZTyKmkA8JBnLVS7Vv-b_Q,5,"Absolutely wonderful. Went in with a group of friends and were amazed with the food and service. I can be a tough critic, considering I am a fine dining restaurant manager, and could not find a single thing wrong! Bartenders were some of the funniest I have had the opportunity to sit with. General Manager was very gracious and helpful. Would recommend to anyone!"
PPwn5GjgeQISvAxEr4w0Bw,5,This place is fantastic! It's the best meal for a light lunch. I order the cold turkey and avocado but always ask them to heat up the turkey. SO GOOD. The service and staff is incredible as well. I'm always so pleased and happy after I leave this place.
o_dX_-4242uRq3SWjhRR1A,1,"2 weeks ago I placed an order on a TV and after 2 weeks of waiting eagerly for the fireplace, when I checked the order status I saw that the oder had been cancelled. No, I had not received any sort of notification or email about the cancellation.

Customer service tried to deceive me with lame excuses of why I didn't receive it yet till they ran out of excuses and admitted that they had run out of stock. I'm flabbergasted. No where during the sales process was I informed that the purchase was contingent on there being enough stock to fulfill the order. If I had known that, I would never have purchased the TV from Costco to begin with; Instead I would have gone with Amazon but now the deal theres is gone. Alas, Now I'm screwed. I don't have a TV, and the deals that were available over that weekend are no longer available.
I still see the charge on my credit card statement and until this moment I didn't receive a refund for what I paid. 
I'm gonna contact Costco tomorrow and cancel my membership, I no longer want to do business with such an irresponsible business with a horrible customer service that 'unfortunately cannot do anything for me'
Stay away if you know what's good for you."
0nhgf9ZoVbzSohdhsxAZTA,5,4.5 stars. Pizza is incredible. One of the best in Pittsburgh. Breadsticks are just ok. Wings are really good.
0JJCqMvwBZNARTOKpc6eOA,4,"Love this place! Very high quality, if not pricey food. The reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour. The prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it's only $7 for this quality bacon burger. You get your choice of cheese ( I get blue) & a side of fries. If your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in Vegas."
DlCIfHndVekfFTfyJ8MqXg,4,"What a great hole-in-the-wall place for great food, drink and service.

Easy to miss if you're not from around the area. Also an older building, which gives it even more of a local and home-like feel.

They had drink specials for Happy Hour on a Wednesday, which was great. And they had half off wings, which was their special that day.

I opted for a glass of Pinot and did the pasta combo -- spaghetti, ravioli, sausage and meatballs. Sauce was actually good with lots of flavor. I was expecting a bland and watery sauce, but it held up. Awesome prices for the amount of food you get.

Our server was really nice and was actually the one taking care of the entire restaurant. And the tables were seemingly full for a Wednesday evening.

Would come back again."
hAIrki2p0QLomSLN4y-RkQ,3,"Tried Anew for the first time with high hopes for an exciting and exclusive night out. Their affordable prefixed menu stands out from the crowd. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the wait staff is knowledgable and kind. Where it fell flat for my party were the items on the menu and the food that came out. We had noted an allergy in the original reservation and after a phone call and promise of the allergy being taken seriously, it presented as the main fish on the menu. This limited our ability to partake in the 5 course tasting which is why we originally went. So we opted for 3. The food focused on small portions with unique gastronomy and plating. The taste and overall finish of the food could have been improved upon as my pork dish seemed under cooked and was leaking blood, it had the texture of raw bacon. The worst part for me was, I wasn't certain if this is how fancy restaurants cook meat and I was uncomfortable saying anything. The serving sizes are small but I suppose that is to be expected with the price of a multi-course dinner being so fair. So the reason I gave a three rating isn't because we hated it nor because we really liked it. It simply was an experience that we likely wouldn't repeat. We would rather spend our money somewhere that was more comfortable with larger portions and food that focused on taste and less on fancy cooking techniques (there was a lot of foam) and left us feeling fulfilled."
oak-ph9-HCzfL7IoKoaB9Q,5,Love it. My 1 st time here. Came with a group and the accommodated us perfectly. The person who took our order was very friendly and helpful when ordering.
_fOqi7HQ2irRwgu-LdOxfQ,5,"Came here on my visit to Vegas. My boyfriend and I were looking on Yelp and found this place! It looked great and I'm a sucker for visuals so the photos did it for me and I do not regret coming here at all! I think the concept of the restaurant is absolutely amazing! They have a health conscious side and a not so healthy side but everything sounds amazing because they have such a great selection and kind of a twist to some things. The names of their plates are super fun and give off a great vibe! The inside of the restaurant is such a creative design! The staff was very friendly and informative about their menu so making a choice wasn't hard! But the options keep you thinking. 

I live in LA and I always think about going here! PLEASE COME TO LA."
h-uHW6SpxkUMjo89COFdSg,4,"I was only there for  day for a conference, but I had such a nice time. The pool is beautiful with a really nice stream that runs in front of the hotel. So, you can eat out by the water where there are no swimmers. There is complementary gym which was really nice. The staff was nice, although checkout was really early (11am)."
dns3g_p224uYfKkWaD7p_Q,4,"Always come when visiting Vegas and now we are pretty good with figuring out when is the best time to come without having to wait too long. Can't go wrong with the adobo fried rice and extra charge for specialty pancakes. All pancakes have a great taste, but many come with their toppings thrown on top, not mixed into the batter, so just be aware."
Dn3QJMzVWWzWwL6MH8bRXQ,5,"Dankys offers excellent quality bbq that is homemade quality. I have ordered the Danky sandwich the last few times. So good. Try it, you will like it"
cF5Eq3S9cvaQPPqBNKhzCg,2,"We were coming back from the east side today which never happens so we decided to treat ourselves to Sweetie Fry. I was so excited because the first few times I went I was in loooove with this place and was just dying to get back. 

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I mean, it isn't bad. It's actually pretty good, but today's experience was just not on par with the past. 

Biggest, almost inexplicable change - NO MORE WAFFLE FRIES!! I cannot understand this. They are just no longer on the menu. These were like angel tears in the form of fries and the reviewers raved about them so I just didn't get it. I asked the kid behind the counter why no more waffles and he said they kept having the waffle fry cutter machine break and it cost too much to fix it. 

Ok, I get it, being a business owner is about making tough choices, but sorry, you've taken away a major plus about your menu. Those waffle fries were SO DAMN GOOD! Total bummer. Also the kid today didn't offer us the little scoop on top of the ice cream as usual. 

The fries were still pretty good, but I was really unimpressed when compared to my previous experiences. What a disappointment. I can see myself going back but no more going out of my way. :("
F_G-06POpxRcR7lq91DlGA,5,"I love Kerry's car care!! Their staff is so friendly and funny!! They have a shuttle if you can't get home or can't stay there while they work on your car. If they don't have a shuttle, they will call an Uber for you for free!! I actually look forward to going in to get my oil changed because the staff is so awesome. And they have great prices. I don't have any complaints about them"
74x8LENx_DJlIEM61cVwIA,1,"I really wish that I could rate higher to reflect the staff (which is great and they've always been sweet and helpful) but honestly the clientele are what push me away from this gym. Approximately 99% of the members here are middle aged and older men that don't know any gym etiquette. Usually being the only girl in the weights area doesn't bother me but it REALLY bugs me when the old men can't break their stare at me and mind their own business. It's like every time I look up from a set an old man is staring at me inappropriately. The worst is when guys invade your personal space just to try to get closer to the young girl in the gym. NO THANKS. Another big peeve is the dudes that sit on their phones for 30 minutes between sets and prolonged stares. The sad thing is there's nothing the staff can really do to teach these boys with poor manners how to conduct themselves in a gym with females around, so I now have to find a different gym likely at a higher rate to be in an atmosphere of most respectable clientele. I hope that one of you read this review while sitting on your DAMN PHONE between sets (get to work and stop staring)!"
iu2SQhsO_V6JCPerFiDSgw,4,"How can anyone not love this place?! It's open 24 hours to boot!

This was our first stop in Vegas per friends' recommendations and it was great! The sandwiches were fresh, flavorful, and fun to eat! I was perfectly stuffed after one but some friends bought another and shared. I love how the bread is crisped and the meat inside tastes really good. My only critique would be that they all start tasting the same after awhile, unless there's horseradish in there, haha."
nY_D_nwCm7xEifAXBsD_Kg,5,"My daughter and I both visited this office. I took the time to go online and fill out and print my patient information sheet to avoid the troubles at the office. This made my process go so fast. Upon arrival my daughter and I were very pleased with the staff and cleanliness of the facility. Everyone was very nice to us. My daughter and I were both assisted together. 
They were very diligent in checking the health of our eyes. Both my daughter and I needed to have our prescriptions corrected. Upon viewing the changes I was so relieved with the new lenses/glasses I was getting. I really felt like they went over and beyond to meet my needs and maintain my vision healthy, and my daughter agreed that she loved the attention we got.
They really know their insurance partners, and they made sure to apply all the available co-pays  and discounts for us. My daughter was able to get two pairs for school with the back to school special they had as well. I highly recommend this doctor and office, you will have a wonderful experience."
8dFSIGbfIQ9hhuxICWWSkg,4,Gem of the Riviera for sure! Stopped in for happy hour.  Pinot Grigio is not on the menu but they still served it to me at 5$ a glass.  I had to take my fries to go eventually - you can really taste the truffle oil - great size portions can't complain at all!!! I suggest the parmesan truffle fries or caprese skewers! I had a great bartender too left a 3$ tip on a 10$ bill!!! :)
C6_TxJpx9SSnbyc5DttJzA,4,"Had a blast here. The Cosmopolitan and The Chandelier are amazing, and this place helps top off the Cosmo experience. Was fortunate to have a friend of a friend who was friends with head of security here so we even got to go VIP and practically walk right in. This was key especially since there were literally about 300 hundred people waiting in the ""reserved"" and general line. 

Club was 3 stories... one floor played hip hop, the other house, and the top floor was the ""Library."" My fav part. You have to check it out to see what I mean. It's set up like a library/study with a fireplace and couches...except with full bar and music. 

Only thing is that this place is HOT right now and get extremely crowded. But that could be a good thing. :)"
7yQMfcauPOK6EbEOyVTdhQ,5,"Stopped in for lunch while on the road. First off, this place smells like an authentic Italian deli and I spent my childhood on them back east. The employees were friendly and accommodating. I had an Italian po boy which was stuffed with Italian meats, peppers, and tomatoes. Also got a pasta salad which I though would be scooped out of a bucket of pre-made salad but I was pleasantly surprised that it was home made and delicious. It was very fresh and the pasta was still al dente, which a lot of places don't provide. They also have coffee and deserts. Really liked this place."
Od5pJbdbTHK3TV2jI0FiAA,5,"Some of the best service I've ever received. Everyone was nice, understanding and professional. You can tell that they really care about their people cliens and animal clients. I took my dog there in the middle of the night because we suspected he ate a grape. They took his vitals for free and advised me on next steps. Highly recommended!"
tRsOGrds9gGJFOubqg7otA,5,"Good chill bar. Go every time  I am in Charlotte.  Close to everything in downtown - restaurants, hotels, etc."
d-YHlP2jMuiyRVQPUH6_kA,1,Every time I go here there is no point in ordering what I want because they'll just end up giving me what they want. The order is always wrong they're all young kids so that's why the service isn't that great so I let that go and that's what i say is the reason why they don't get the order right and we all make mistakes but this time was just even worse. I was waiting for the food they had me pull to the front and I see the girl coming out with my order in one hand and her phone in the other walks out of the store still using her phone comes to my car still on her phone while she gives me the food. That was just unprofessional. When I get home and eat the food the chicken is clearly old and as been in the fryer a few times because you could taste the old oil and how hard it was. This was just a bad experience and I hope Wendy's does something how they make their  'fresh' food.
Ax4uHBrouR5_l1X2EUG9CA,4,One of my favorite places for Mexican food. Staff has always been very friendly and the food's always been delicious. I just wish they would put alcohol in their margaritas!!!!
rc8EREmmkn1okSBzBn-J6w,4,"Good hot dogs, the owner or manager was super friendly and funny. I got the Chili Cheese and Onion with the loaded tots, my buddy go the PBJJJ or however  its called and the mac and cheese dog with a root beer. His bill was a little over $16 and mines was $12. He said both his dog were delish.. I couldn't get past the peanut butter on the hot dog lol. I only have two major gripes. I get they are ""gourmet"" style dogs but the prices seem a little steep, and they really should have a soda machine and not just bottled drinks. Me personally I will probably stick to windy city as I don't stray from basic hot dogs and the prices are more reasonable. If in the area again I would come back"
xmSP3uGu1b8-klskz19Wkw,2,"We were in the Las Vegas area visiting and decided to check out Twin Creeks given the positive reviews we read on Yelp. Overall a disappointing experience. This place earns a 2 1/2 stars in my book, but I am giving them 2 stars based on the rating scale. 

We had reservations at 8P since that was the earliest they could accommodate our party of 6 on a Saturday night. (we made reservations 2 days out) We arrived at 7:45P and were advised to return at 8P as our table was not available yet. Not a problem, interesting that they did not invite us to wait in the bar area. However, the bar seemed crowded with diners as well. We returned at 8P and were seated within 5 minutes. Although we placed our orders within 10 minutes of being seated, our dinners were not served until 9:15 P. 

First the positive stuff......dinners are served with a house salad and two sides. The BBQ Bourbon Rib Eye steak was excellent. Cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. Prime Rib was served medium rare as requested. Mashed potatoes were made from real potatoes and not the instant stuff. 

Now for the negative.....Our waiter spent the better part of the evening attending to another table across way so it was near impossible to get his attention. Luckily, the assistant waiter was attentive and kept our water glasses filled and handle any requests that we had. I ordered the lobster since it was recommended in several reviews. Unfortunately, I thought it was on the tough side. (maybe it was overcooked?!?) In addition, it was barely lukewarm when served. Since it had taken so long for our dinner to arrive, I was afraid if I sent it back, I may never get anything to eat. In my past experience, the waiter usually removes the lobster tail from the shell ~ not in this case. Once our dinner was served, I don't recall seeing our waiter until dessert time. I tasted a piece of my friend's prime rib. Although it was served medium rare as requested, the meat was barely lukewarm at best and not that tender. The meat had no flavor, I had to add salt and pepper. 

Prices are reasonable, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. The general consensus of our group is that we would not recommend this place nor would we be returning for a second visit."
IPjNzZHNe8U7C5J5btgAzw,5,La maison Christian Faure est un bijou de la pâtisserie française nichée au vieux port de Montréal. Vous allez y trouver des pâtisseries d'excellente qualités!!! Le croissant aux amandes est le MEILLEUR de tout montreal. Je vous recommande fortement cette endroit. Vous ne regretterez pas! Je n'hésite pas a y retourner des que possible.
IO8B7L4Y1hin-bPIWKDCBg,4,"I LOVE the lasagna here.  It's huge and never dried out.  They put lots of the amazing red sauce on it.  I love that red sauce!  They also have amazing Italian sausage.  Best in the Valley.  If you get the pizza, ask for THIN crust.  Not a fan of the regular crust.....it's too thick for me.  I enjoy eating here for lunch."
b057pUENtOBx5RNqHDQ5Ng,2,"The service was less than stellar.  We sat in the bar area and asked for full dinner menus (instead of just happy hour menus).  We never got them so I had to approach another server to get them.  The Manager finally had to come over to take our order because the Server completely forgot about us.  Our salads came out, however, not the way we ordered them.  I asked for dressing on the side and the salad came completely dressed with the Vinaigrette.  This wasn't even the end of our evening there - they forgot our steak dinners that we ordered - it never came.  We finally asked the Hostess for our check and left without ever having our entree."
cihW5WOA3Xr32LI5XOEdFg,3,"I've been here a few times. They usually do a great job and it's moderately priced. Today while getting a massage, the man performing my pedicure massaged me uncomfortably high on my inner thy. I was weirded out, and wasn't sure if I was reading into it. After thinking about it, I realized I've never had someone massage above the knees. I informed the manager upon checking out. She was friendly and seemed super concerned. She said it was the first complaint she had received about it and seemed genuinely apologetic.  So beware of the balding man working there, he's a perv. She said she would keep an eye on him and thanked me for informing her. Needless to say, I did not tip him and won't go back. :("
RqtDQD70C59f88m6r0Yiiw,5,Amazing simply sensational seafood & spectacular view. Have always had great servers full of recommendations and wine advice. Just really well done- a standard.
Y-I2ixgHfXyiRH72XccMMQ,5,"First of all I hope that nobody needs to see an emergency vet.  We had a brand new puppy, he wasn't feeling well and we took him in.  They were straight forward with us, explained what the treatment options were and the costs and risks associated with all of them.  We decided to hospitalize him and go for the full treatment as we had just lost a family dog and couldn't risk any additional heartbreak.  1st pet was fantastic, they updated us regularly, patiently answered our many questions and took care of our pup as if he were theirs.

Trust them to help you in a very scary time, it worked for us!"
J_RVfn9oG75mZbfz9Fuz8A,2,"The service was more awkward than attentive. My family and I were out for a very special occasion.  Which we made sure the server and restaurant knew about, nothing above and beyond or even ""special"" was done or offered.  (Except a little confetti on the table)

Things started with being handed a huge wine list on a tablet with no guidance - then no personal assist from the sommelier, just the server asking them a brief question for us.  

Excessively seasoned (fire hot), appetizer.  Almost inedible for a few of us at the table.  I suspect the use of a complementary voucher to be the culprit for that. 

Then being served the wrong steaks and having to switch them ourselves at the table.   Once the steaks were settled, they seemed very well prepared and were enjoyed. 

Onward to addressing one of the party members by the wrong gender.  Apologizing of course, but still uncomfortable. 

Another of our party ordered the pan seared tuna - it was the worst cut of tuna possible.  Stringy, difficult to bite and without being given a steak knife it was almost impossible to cut. (The meal was not sent back because of the occasion and not wanting to make a fuss)

We ended our meal with burnt coffee and what turned out to be delicious desserts. 

The price, the occasion and the fact we went for dinner, not lunch, added up to the assumption that this would be a wonderful evening.  It turned out mostly mediocre.  I honestly have had a better time and better food, for a more reasonable price at local/neighborhood bars/resturaunts.  Do not fall for the hype. Try a small local fine dining restaurant.  You and your party will thank you for it!"
uWOYqfwAWWi5ZszLS2b-0g,4,Good food and service.. We will be back.  Everything we ordered was delicious..The decorations are pretty fun as well!

II called the office to ask that the drivers be advised to observe this speed limit.  I gave the name of our street but the representative would not take the report without my giving my specific contact information which I declined to do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and that request was refused, also.  I am pretty disgusted.  I hope that Republic will see t his post and tell their drivers to DRIVE SAFELY AT ALL TIMES."

Prices are reasonable, the place is clean and decorated in the Louisiana flavor. Our server Nicole was the best with her friendly, outgoing nature and on-the-spot service. We will certainly be going back there again and again and we would all highly recommend that everyone try this seafood restaurant! Outstanding!"
3N-et-ZhEwTZEdQt6KEXWA,5,Best cupcakes in the entire Charlotte area!! These cupcakes have the PERFECT amount of icing. It's not piled high and overwhelming  like other cupcake bakeries. The daily flavor selections are perfect. I have personally devoured a salted caramel cupcake and it was the best I've ever had!!
p4EMGWUIr1iJ8xfhV5J9fA,2,"I stopped in at 440 Saturday morning to pick up donuts for work. The two employees didn't notice me walk in, but the young lady who was breaking down boxes finally saw me standing there. No apology, no ""thanks for waiting"". I placed my order and she used the same gloved hand she was using to break down the boxes. But the most irritating thing was the counter; it was full of crumbs and powdered sugar. After leaning against it, my work clothes were a mess. And no ""Thanks"" from the employee. Donuts=good   Service=not good"
jeO2sSf1amlcc3osUL77Sw,4,"We came past when it was closed was able to take a few pictures of the displays they had out front.  Made a mental note that we would be back the following day when they were open. 
They were handing out free samples of kisses. They handed out free samples of their ice cream too. If you walk to the cash register on the mall side you will see a display of their giant chocolate or strawberry bottles and you could have your picture put on the bottle. It is definitely worth the few extra dollars to get it done. The cashier wasn't all that pleasant...but the customer service person that helped us take our picture which happened to be in front of the Statue of Liberty on the mall entrance really made up for the not-so-friendly cashier. If you go upstairs you will see a Twizzler Statue of Liberty. Feel free to take pictures... But don't touch. The make a video area was not working properly so we couldn't take advantage of that freeie...but all in all it was definitely worth the second trip back."
QyuZLDM7Iui3vsiP5OSfBA,5,Can't say enough good things about Joel and this business! He answered all of my questions and my diamond ring never left my sight!  He was extremely courteous and friendly.. He even let me look through his high power microscope to see into my diamond. I felt very comfortable with him and will definitely return for all future appraisals!
6G-_yJC1Kq3LROxRVX_eEA,1,"Since I moved to Tempe and changed my Banfield, I have had nothing but problems.  My pets have come home limping and injured after spending a day in their care.  I show up for scheduled appointments that they don't even have on their computer and they just tell me too bad, or just drop them off and we'll get to them when we can ....but I don't want my pets in their care because of past injuries. When you have sick pets they don't seem to care and they tell you the next available appointment is two weeks away. The list goes on... Find another place to take your pets.  I know I will."

*sigh*

I used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.  
But the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.

Ill Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993)
10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.  Fine... it happens.

The Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004)
So, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, ""regrettably"" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...

By All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988)
At this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with ""that guy""... who told us to talk to ""this guy""... who said to KT, ""Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club"".  Wow, really?

Stakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996)
During the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.

Tougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988)
So, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.

Yeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO.

BIG-UP BIG-UP BIG-UP!  Some of you guys were cool (clip-board guy with the faux-hawk and the Polynesian guys),for trying to do all you coulda/woulda for my girls/crew, thank you much anyway."
iUVFCi8c8GuYCSjltc5W8A,5,"Dane at Disciple Tattoo was top notch. My wife got a Awesome Custom Tattoo on her foot and I got my first ever Tattoo of a cross on my arm. He stayed late, was very patient and we will be back for more!"
-JgUsYwV7KJv2q1DBF2hqA,5,Great service. I was able to get in and out in 45 minutes while also receiving a stellar haircut. I am now a firm believer in the value of paying more for a better barber versus the lower priced options. Ricky also provided consultation and better ways to style it for different occasions. I will be coming back again.
cvAUHhC0iP6zQrcaPhr9gg,2,"I was disappointed that they made me and my friend sit away from each other. I made an appointment for us just so to make sure we could catch up during our girl time. The guy who did my nails was really rough on twisting my fingers so he could get a better angle and kept sanding my actual skin which hurt. I tried SNS for the first time and he didn't shape my nails, so it looked like bubble nails after several layers. Only when I went home and filed it myself I liked the result. When I left I noticed that my thumbs and index fingers were super matte compared to other shiny parts so I went back for a top coat cause the first time it never dried before he told me to go wash my hands. So frustrating overall."
mOxrr8d_RGAr3ONemOgUKw,4,"My first trip to vegas, we stayed here in the west wing rooms, they were gorgeous, quiet and clean. The hotel is huge, but very easy to navigate, and the west wing provides quick and easy strip access while bypassing the casino. this end of the strip is less heavily trafficked so it's a great spot to get a bit away from the crowds after hours of dealing with them further down the strip.

The food court and shops are convenient. The pool area is huge and lush. The staff are friendly and very accommodating. This is more a mid-priced hotel, and my only complaint is the rose air freshener they pump into the lobby, it smells like old lady perfume."
_ZiqRLgI0GAHfBhms7FQ3Q,4,Stayed here last week and it was a very nice hotel.  I really liked the architecture.  My room was very good.  Used the meeting and conference facilities while here and they were very good as well.  Really liked the service at the fire pits at night when I was allowed to bring my own wine down to drink it with friends.  Lunch at the pool was very good.  I would stay here again.
ubtbCs03wKf5pRWgWc2dCw,5,"Tessaro's is getting a subsidy from the butter industry, I'm pretty certain. Everything they serve comes with a glistening sheen of butter, which makes everything delicious and rich, and makes for a bit of heartburn later. Not the worst thing ever.

They make an extremely good steak, perfectly cooked. Their ingredients are excellent. Admittedly I tend to be there just about closing time, but I always get the impression that they can't decide if they are a fine dining establishment or a sports bar where the waitstaff would rather go home than deal with me. 

Their steak salad with home fries and grilled onions means the potatoes, onions and sliced steak are on top of the salad. With butter. So all these delicious components don't quite work as a protein on a salad. I know Pittsburgh is famous for potatoes on sandwiches, but it's just an odd layer to work though.

Their steak sandwich and open faced steak sandwich are exactly what it says: a steak sitting on top of a slice of bread. Absolutely delicious, but not something I would pick up with my hands and eat. 

Having said all that, the food is well made and they close late. The servers are nice enough without being solicitous, and they haven't turned me away yet."
UltN0h2g5llf90JRDQ1HwQ,4,"One of my favorite korean eatery. Have tried a variety of their tofu soup and love them all, the broth is very flavorful. Also tried several other dishes here (seafood noodle soup, japchae, bulgogi, bibimbap, seafood pancake, etc) and have always been satisfied with their flavor and portion size. 

However, their side dishes are not as good as Gogi's. I also like the taste of Gogi's kimchi  better than Chodang's. Prices are a little higher than other korean restaurants in town. 

Would be nice if they offer lunch special like Gogi."
caHNQrli-JA2jUebPJFx9A,5,I love getting my nails done here! I got a simple white tip manicure this time around. Kelly always does an amazing job and never fails to impress me. You must go here!
Jx9-y3ZmJsbTRfalS6GCUw,4,"What a hidden gem! Stopped in here for a few quick drinks and was bummed we couldn't stay longer. $2 domestics and nice bartenders, as well as complimentary charging stations on the bar for your phone- such a nice surprise!"
nedt_Xxs95zOP0ZXzSMx3A,5,"Really delicious. Really. They were doing a special for $40 where you could order unlimited (!) small sample plates of anything on the menu. Stand-outs for us were Wagyu beef slider, enchiladas, and scallops! Always on the hunt for impressive scallops and these were superb."
WPbCZXdnwPraiEw80MnUYQ,4,"I was in a bit of a rush after work one day and needed to get my face waxed (eye brows and upper lip). I knew I would not have time to go to my usual place because it's a good 10 min walk to the place and usually I always have to wait when I get their because they are pretty busy no matter what. I decided to try this place which is right beside my work. When I walked in the lady was friendly and told me it would be about a 15 minute wait for the esthetician. I was told to have a seat in the waiting area which I did. The area was comfy with big comfy chairs. Within minutes (maybe 5) I was called into the room. 

The lady who serviced me was friendly, very chatty, and asked lots of questions about my expectations with the service. Before doing anything she confirmed exactly what she was going to do and asked me if that was ok. I thought that was amazing. I can't even count the number of times I got for a clean up and walk out with a completely new look (which I didn't ask for). 

I felt this place to be a little small but welcoming in it's appearance. I found the price to be really expensive. With tip it cost me double to get my face down. I guess that is the price you have to pay sometimes for convince! I was really shocked but had no choice I was stuck for time but next time I will shop around my work a little better strictly because of that."
Czowg7afgJUWF3nZDuJJ7Q,5,Our server John was great! And the food was terrific! On our next visit from Los Angeles we will definitely return!
5vUikzRhmPZyacOM5DR4VQ,5,"This was one of our favorite eating experiences ever! The food, atmosphere, service and special attention from the manager was incredible. There aren't enough stars for this place."
nB7yVwg4D859NqH1yNKZ9g,3,When we arrived the hostess prompted us to sit at the first table in the bar area (near the front door/ host podium) As its 40 degrees outside tonight I was a little annoyed that the two hostesses working propped the front doors open to bring in all of the outside cushions from the chairs and let the guests inside or near the door freeze. This was not pressing enough to get done at 8:30pm when the restaurant doesn't close until 10pm.
XHlw0ksOutBmTF3fWPMS2Q,1,"We were referred to Leisure Time through our warranty company to have our pool filter replaced. After the work was completed the filter would not backwash (kinda basic).
A call to the company resulted in the advice that maintenance should resolve the issue. Um, no. 
We dropped using the warranty and paid a professional maintenance company to review the situation. The filter had been improperly installed.

At least for repair, couldn't recommend this company."
2ABIgfv_c-1bLyNnMck5vw,5,"We love our yard!  Jesse was great to work with and came up with a great design.  We had them install a huge fire pit and built in BBQ grill surrounded by a huge paver patio in our backyard and install a new irrigation system for the front and back yards.  His crew is hard working and efficient.  Everyone knew what they were doing and didn't make mistakes or waste time.  They jumped right in and completed the huge task in a timely manner.  Before we decided on Desert Crest, we had 6 other companies bid the job.  Most couldn't formulate their own design, and only 1 other company even drew up the plans.  They would just bid exactly what I told them, but I wanted someone who could improve on my ideas and come up with something incredible.  Jesse is that guy.  He drew everything up in a nice detailed plan.  Can't recommend them enough.  If you need your yard done, contact Desert Crest."
9f24uXX-6tdpI0rTKBmI2w,5,"Ever since I moved closer, I have been coming back more often.  I think every visit, it has gotten better and better!  I am glad I can update my review, because the staff and chefs deserve the five stars.  Keep rocking sushi mon!"
qzUwKKRD4vLFBh87HmmV8Q,1,"OMG, they can't even get the chip right here. Came here with 4 people . Got two bowls and they were soggy. Our meals came out at different times and our food got cold waiting for the last dish. Waited for a long time to get a drink refill. The fish tacos were burned and greasy.  I only ate enough to get rid of my hunger pains. The server asked if  I wanted a to go box....no we left a lot of food on the table. There are way better places than this to go eat at. I am done eating here."
sFfo0HwbH_Gs2Xg_-r8JSA,4,"One of my go-tos for lunch and sometimes, even breakfast.  I was, at first, not too happy with their choices as they lacked pescetarian/vegetarian-friendly options (I only eat ""land meat"" at dinner), but am glad to see more choices now.  One of my favourites is the apple and brie baguette as well as falafel salad (if I feel like something fried).  They also have almond milk, which Starbucks still doesn't have!  I'm not a fan of their fruit/granola cups with yogurt as it's a flavoured!  The fruit is sweet enough that one doesn't need any additional sweetener!"
VQh8QWB0Fm8hyrOlkEDBiw,5,"Wow went the AZ State Fair to hear Weezer, and covered the whole perimeter of the Fair before I found a shop that sold something that wasn't deep fried -- I'm pretty sure even the racing lemurs were wrapped in bacon.  

I found Piggly's and ordered the $12 BBQ beef sandwich, which was awesome.  About 3/4 lbs. of BBQ beef with carmelized onions and cole slaw. 

So when you eat it a 2nd meal of beefy goodness escapes the toasted hogey bun onto the paper plate, and then you have to get a fork to finish it. 

I'm definitely going to drive to the restaurant to check out their prime rib, etc."
9seoqxVv7L3SjG1aiCxuIg,5,"My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  The menu is inventive and creative.  The shishito pepper app is to die for.  The pizza is always perfectly cooked and I've tried some things I have never had before on a pizza (ie. fried egg, kale, etc.) and have loved every pie.  Love this place."
Q30B11OUsQeaI3UNKQ2iUw,5,New to Las Vegas- but the Dentist was great so was the D.A. And D.H.- staff exceptional and very caring!  I would highly recommend this center.
D7JsRJJY4HxgCN-azDpAgw,5,"We have traditionally taken our vehicles strictly to the dealerships for any type of repairs. Recently my wife found a coupon for Dean's in the ValuPak. She convinced me to give them a try and we are glad we did. 

She celled them to talk about to schedule an appointment. When she got off the phone she just couldn't stop raving about their customer service. That was just the first call. The following day we dropped the car off to them 15 minutes before they opened for the day. Again, great customer service.

The great customer service just kept consistent through our entire experience. Their quality of work has been great and they don't try to push repairs on you.

I didn't use it, but I understand that they offer a shuttle service.

Since writing this review I have received a phone call from them making sure that I was satisfied with their service and received a thank you card in the mail. They continue to impress me. When was the last time you got that level of service from anyone?"
J29khZ2awECAQo9g6B_01Q,4,"Great non-RMT massages. Been going since I stumbled on this place during the TIFF film festival 6+ years ago. Great hotlumi, Thai and Swedish massage. Excellent masseurs who know their stuff and the receptionist staff are smart and charming. Nice zen ambience for relaxing but not pretentious like other Yorkville spas. 

Great prices too."
7EkeusuB608BtKRYd3-pZA,1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I called to order a pizza and the guy on the phone told me it would take 20 mint to pick up. When I got  THERE,    there was this really young kid/teenager on the register. I paid for my pizza and waited and waited. Mean while you can hear a young girl cursing in the back and laughing away. After 45 minutes later I asked him what was going up with the pizza,  he said he would check,  he went to the back and I clearly heard him tell a coworker ""this bi#$% wants her pizza '. When he returned I confronted him asking him if he had just called me that and he turned red and said no and walked away. The manager showed up and he made excuses for him saying he was tired and tried to give me a coupon. I told him I didn't care about the money it was the respect. Then he said he always has trouble with this guy. Manager could not make up his mind. THIS KID NEEDS TO GET  HIS A@%@ WIPPED AND BE TAUGHT A MANNER LESSON. HE HAS NO RESPECT!! AND THE PIZZA WAS  HORRIBLE. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN. WORSE PLACE EVER, WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE."
p4PyrGY9SLBQKqCU2QWMqQ,5,"What a beautiful hotel!  The staff is amazing and so friendly!  The kick start appetizers were a huge hit with not only the adults, but also the kids.  Rooms are large and the refrigerator and microwave were so convenient.  Soda, coffee, and popcorn from 3-10pm made an already wonderful experience even better!  The kids have named this their favorite hotel of all and one even requested a return visit for his birthday!  Super friendly staff, spacious rooms, great breakfast spread, and awesome happy hour with 3 free drinks and food!  What a great find!"
uIRyCAkNrRG5vVEOfhi1DQ,4,"The only reason for not giving five stars was that I did not end up purchasing a scooter at Western Honda. Transportation to Tucson was problematic for me. However I dealt for many days with Lloyd, who treated me with courtesy, honesty, and humor. He did not try to jerk me around on price as several other dealers did. No ridiculous add-ons to the list price, just an OTD price that was the best I got on the Honda scooter. I really appreciated my dealings with this dealer. They are great!"
GNGh1xmmSDJw86i83m1d_A,1,"DO NOT GET TAKEN BY PRIVATE ROOM OFFER!! 30 min for $60 but once you go back yo have to pay at least $60 as a tip and to get full nude dance several hundred dollars more as tip. They initially say full nude dance in the private room... with tip. But if you dont have several humdred $$ it just a long boring lap dance.... I tried 2 private rooms thinking it depends on the girl... NOPE you wont even get full nude dance with $100.
Stay away from this private room... BIG RIP OFF."
-fVVDFJ0UeYfPePsLapfBw,5,One of my favorite breakfast spots! Their staff is very friendly and their service is great. Their iced coffee is SO good and they have a variety of breakfast and lunch options!
i5UwUPlQFPLcE8p2gPFwBw,4,"For being fairly ""fast"" food.. Pei Wei (pronounced pay way I confirmed haha) is pretty darn good. we got a few things to share. I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable."
iCvTd6L4hD_stG2Dmto8-A,5,"In the center of all the hustle and bustle of city center lies Mandarin Oriental, the epitome of luxury and relaxation. It's a global chain but when we stayed, we were made to feel like the only ones there! The service is beyond compare everywhere in this beautifully designed hotel. We were recognized and greeted by name almost everywhere we went, from valet to the spa. The rooms were thoughtfully appointed with all you could want and need; the bed is heavenly; the bathroom is stocked with the basics, plus extras that really send a girl over the moon like bath salts, a hair straightener, and a loofa. The pool is calm and relaxing with comfortable loungers. The bright and open spa is among the best in the world with unrivaled amenities and service in the most beautiful setting. And the views from the public areas including the tea room and Mandarin Bar are breathtaking. My husband and I plan on making this an annual staycation because it was so special. It's hard to believe we can achieve such relaxation and receive world class service only 15 minutes from home. I hated to check out, but all of this comes at quite a price so we'll stick to annual weekend escapes here."
AHL4CvM9PyKdoEMcrHA5Ew,5,"AMAZING.. AMAZING.. AMAZING.. Great location, great atmosphere., great food, good service.. dessert I could have pased on, but other than that I had fantastic experience... I have a friend coming in town at the end of the month, cant wait to bring her!  LOVE THE BATHROOM (scottsdale location).."
B93Vx9_ikki3XllngogceQ,1,"Waited a really long time just for the drinks which were just 2 waters and a latte-30 minutes. There was even a large group who walked out and said they have been waiting for 45 minutes. If it weren't for David coming in as our server, we wouldve walked out. David took care of us and apologized for the wait and explained the shortage of staff. Food was good, but they need more staff to help them out."
Pup0Yldi62HNInzUv8O-Sg,4,"We had a staycation here last night for a concert and were pleasantly surprised. Great property with updated, remodeled rooms. Just returned from a trip to LA (5 star resort). This room was nicer, twice the size and included more amenities. We will be back!"
HPnIN6fOBKvNiEIZmT1FJQ,5,"So this is one of those places that you think couldn't possibly be as good as everyone says. OH... but it is.

The seating is minimal and weird. To be honest. However, the food makes up for it times a million.

You go in to this weird little kitchen area that looks odd and industrial and you order. There's only like, 3 things on the menu so it's pretty easy to choose. I recommend for the first visit do the 1/2 and 1/2 with the works. Then you can decide which one you like better. My meal with a drink was $10. I can accept that!

We went and sat down at a tiny table. It was lunch time and school is in session so it was a bit packed, but we were still able to find seating for the three of us. They brought us the food relatively quickly which is really nice when you're on a one-hour lunch break.

It was phenomenal! I mean, it looks and sounds so plain but for some reason it's like... the best dumplings you have ever had. Just wonderful. And it's super addicting. I actually crave it. It's a fun little experience and it's something different that you can't get anywhere else in the area.

GO HERE! Seriously. It is truly as good as everyone says. Highly recommend."
CepNfvoUi1pfhkssNraNcA,5,Very upbeat and happy vibe. They serve the rhum in bottles that you can pour yourself and mix with single serve glass bottles of coke - no diet coke available unfortunately. Owner was there and overheard it was our birthday so sent along some premium rum for us to enjoy. We'll definitely be back and would be nice to try the food.

qok8YacyDT-i0jl2CHgPnw,4,"We've been here 2 times now. The food has always been amazing. Great family, laid back atmosphere, and the service has always been fast. Average wait time has been about 15min but plenty of shops to walk to while waiting. Will definitely come back again"
uRo9ZX_DL79c_nTn440FjA,4,"My very first impression was not good because I tried to get in touch with this company on a holiday (memorial day) and after letting the phone ring many many times, a sort of angry sounding guy picked up and said to call back the following business day. I'm glad I did because these guys took us on an awesome after wedding dinner bus tour of the strip and freemont street. We had 34 people on our bus, and they all had a blast! Mike and Rocco were very accomodating. They iced up our drinks, they kept everyone with a drink in hand,  and collected our empty cans. You can bring your own ipod music on board too which is nice. Beside the initial gruff impression, there was only one thing I didn't love. We had to drop off our booze for the bus and a 20 for ice, but it was in this weird sort of shady bus lot with old broken down buses. We were told to put the alcohol and the 20 in one of the buses which was just open and anyone could have in theory taken our stuff. But everything worked out great and when the bus arrived on time, we had ice cold drinks, and wonderful people helping us out. Many thanks to Rocco and Mike for keeping our party going on the double decker bus tour!"
aGP211GvdV1A_LblR8s6cA,4,"I love the Arcadia location of Kneaders, I love Kneaders in general. 

To me this place is an elevated Panera, with a great bakery and really good food. My favorite items are the sourdough pancakes, the broccoli and cheese soup and the BLT with avocado. The pancakes are seriously some of the best pancakes I have ever had, the sourdough taste is subtle but it really brings them over the top.

The only drawback is that they're closed on Sundays (they're like the Chick-Fil-A of bakery chains).

Great spot though, centrally located in Arcadia."
zL9rBG-3PB2yMYgfYDD3iQ,4,I just enjoyed (huge emphasis on enjoy) breakfast at I Heart Waffle today. I am a social eater which means I take a little food from everyone around me. This allowed me to sample many yummy things. My waffle was perfect and the omelet was one of the best I've ever had. Seriously how do you make fried chicken wings with no oil? And the Cajun grits.... OMG!! Let me also say the staff was wonderful. The ladies working the counter and running the food were friendly and professional. The chefs were quick and efficient.
zV2v2-Qk_XL0ycHgpeDXtA,5,"Reeeally, really good food :) I've been to a couple of Ethiopian restaurants around Toronto and this one is by far my favourite. The atmosphere (especially at night) can be really intimate, making it a great place for a date or to chill a friend or too. And it's a whole new eating experience since you're essentially eating with bread rather than with a knife and fork. Looks like it might be hard to fit a group larger than 4, but I could be mistaken - it's two levels but I've only ever sat on the first floor. They have good combinations of veg, meat, and meat/veg if you just want to try a bit of a bunch of dishes. Going at lunch can be cheap since they have a lot of deals."
sLCPh4aIeKLr1DoZpxoRpA,5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Bebee Nails!!!!!  They never seem to disappoint.  This time I was able to try their new CHROME gel nails and I LOVE how my fingers and toes feel and look!!! I highly recommend Bebee Nail :)

Talented and genuinely awesome, in general, you will most definitely not be disappointed in the work she does for you. If I lived in the region (I'm from Louisville, Kentucky), she would definitely be doing more work on me. I also want to show props to the rest of the artists and staff. Everyone was very friendly. The overall ""vibe"" in this place will show a newcomer how well the staff gels. All in all, a great experience. Thank you!"

Especially a breezy sunny day, there's no restaurant I rather be than here and sit on the outdoor (or semi-outdoor covered) patio, enjoying their hot fresh baguette and their wonderful brie burger.  Everything we have tried here have been good and consistent.  Wonderful place for lunch."

It also came with a slice of pita bread which was hard like toast (stale maybe?). I didn't even eat half of the meal and tossed it. Hubby's lamb shank had a weird fishy taste, yes I said fishy taste on a hunk of lamb  Needless to say, we won't be returning."

Connoisseurs avoid buy if u r getting desperate to relieve ur taste buds of South Indian taste , try it !"
rllxP7E_znFS6Lvog2Zerg,5,This is a great place. They are consistent with their food. Service is incomparable. They prepare their dishes quickly. Prices are just right.  I don't agree with the negative reviews.
3w2WWC4IpVX303cHqYdE7A,5,I was in town for the weekend and desperately needed my nails done. I found the nail room from searching best nails salons in Vegas and they popped up. I had Lori do my nails and she did phenomenal job!! My nails were on point and I actually got lots of compliments on them when I went back home. What a nice gem I found to bad they don't have one in my home town.
WEN8kD0ttFCdnwHowuchxg,3,"Went to the farm for the first time ever. Yeah, I'm clueless. I don't know how I've been living in the city so long & not known about Riverdale farm. Anyhoot, it was really a lovely place to visit. Got to pet a mama & baby goat. The Clydesdale horse looked lonely. There was a sign that said the other Clydesdale named Dolly died due to old age. RIP Dolly! There was also a donkey only interested in its food, pigs, a turkey, numerous chickens, roosters & cows. The poor cows looked grumpy & bored. But other than that we had a nice walk around. The pond thereabouts is covered in green algae. So we didn't see any ducks, birds or fish about.

I hope Ford doesn't close this place down! It would be a real shame. It's a great place for city kids to come meet some farm animals."
nNKKTpPwsulM8v-T4ZFSIg,1,"Ugh! Why is this the only place around with half way decent wings?? I'd think in a metropolis this large there would be way more choices. Service generally sucks. The servers are always pre occupied somewhere else. Talking to regulars or their friends. Can't tell. So today. Aloof as usual. Girlfriend orders a tall vodka soda, bar maid brings a short. We order wings and fries. She was so busy interrupting my order to ask if I've ever had the hot wings I just ordered. YES!!!!! I've had them before and they're not even in the realm of ""hot"". So she totally didn't put my fries order in. Apologizes as though that fixes everything. Then my fries come out late as hell and under cooked. I think I'm done with this place!"
EfJN6qK6oDmLjJ7E3Zxokg,5,"We absolutely love Pusadee's!! It is tied with Nicky's Thai Kitchen as our favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. It breaks our hearts when they close for the winter, but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again! 

We have eaten in and done takeout here many times, so this review is much overdue.  Takeout service is always quick and efficient. We are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up (compare this to Thai Place in Aspinwall, which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being ""busy"" but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived...). 

The indoor space is sparse but functional. There are simple tables and chairs, and not much decorations on the walls. Their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here. The garden is lovely and relaxing, with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing. We attempted to eat outside yesterday, but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors. Someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the garden!

We typically order two different dishes and share. We start out with the fresh garden rolls, which are delicious. It is a small order, but the perfect start to a meal. The vinegar sauce is light and refreshing, but I do prefer the peanut sauce that Nicky's offers with their spring rolls. We have had the red, green, and pumpkin curries, and our favorite is the green. The sauce is more complex than the pumpkin, even though we love the pumpkin chunks! There are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce. We also share an order of brown rice, which is worth the extra cost. I recently had Thai in NYC, and I have to say that I loved the curry at Pusadee's much better! Their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect. 

Pusadee's and Nicky's will continue to be our favorite Thai places here! I am so glad that Pittsburgh has more and more options for great Thai dining."
bcGwJYxHjK5Hr7Dz6DhBBA,2,"I had higher expectations for this place since the reviews were so good. We went for dinner around 5 pm and felt like were being rushed, the waitress kept harassing us to order our food even though we had probably sat for 5 minutes. None of the staff were friendly. After we did order our food we received it within 7 minutes, which made me think it wasn't very fresh and it didn't taste fresh either. I ordered the Garganelli Geppetto, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. I had a lava cake type of dessert which was actually really good and I enjoyed it. That was the only good part. Would not be going back here."
igkHy6QBXqQDfNVrdl7uXA,5,My wife and I have a great time talking with the staff. Very friendly and open for convo. The coffee is great too. The owners are super cool too
EPGK_LlQqR3qF0ePGBBpCg,4,"I love the sauces that you can choose from. I personally like the mango habanero. Their wing prices are very reasonable, and they are a good size meaty wing. I also really love that I can get wings in a drive thru. 
I would be 4-5 stars if the food was more consistant. This last time it wasn't too busy but the fries weren't hot, boarding on being cold. The wings weren't hot as well. I have had great hot food served to me before, and I know how good the food can be. I still enjoy coming here and hope for some crispy fries next time."
uiZL0MAuO2BULO32L1pk5g,4,"If I lived in the region, I would make a point of eating my way through the full DW menu. (Actually, I'd move or shoot myself, but let's just pretend.) We stopped by during their Sunday brunch madness, found ourselves staring down an hour wait, and opted for food to-go on our way to the desert.
The staff at DW is impressively competent and friendly. They're essentially wrangling a herd of ravenous socialites with the attention spans and attention demands of toddlers, and they do so admirably.
Not surprisingly, we ordered Jerk Chicken & Waffles as well as the Jerk Pork Hash. Both meats were nicely cooked and the portions were perfect. If you're still reading, you're no doubt wondering why this isn't a four-star review. Two reasons:
1. Their jerk seasoning is much too timid. You get the allspice, some herbs, and citrus (there's even some additional orange rind on the waffles), but the habanero heat is a no show. It doesn't move far enough beyond regular chicken & waffles.
2. I am not a weirdo who carries condiments in my man-purse, but I'm officially designating DW as a B.Y.O.Syrup establishment. It's a sad moment when you find yourself wishing you could un-pour the sticky sweetness you just splashed all over your waffles and chicken (for the record, you cannot). You know that irrevocable moment when you dump way too much brandy or Grand Marnier into your recipe and convert the whole dish into a boozy mess? We've all done it, and we'll probably do it again. With luck, DW only did it on the day we visited. The syrup was odd, overbearing, and unfortunate. You have been warned."
Vx5NUSeP4uruJQqiViKNqg,4,"We went to Origin India last night after hearing they've brought in a new chef from the UK who was supposedly awesome. Well, they were right.  Presentation and tons of flavor - not what we are used to seeing at Indian restaurants out here in Vegas. This review really teeters around 4.5 stars...

We started off with the Chicken Chili Stir fry and Lamb Seekh Kabob. Both had intense flavor and were SPICY (just the way we asked for it). 

Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!

I also ordered a side of okra which is my favorite vegetarian dish. It was good but not as great as my dad makes :)

The chef served us a complimentary dessert which was a little piece of heaven. Saffron poached pear with vanilla ice cream and an orange panacotta. Out of this world!

The husband is not a fan of eating Indian food in restaurants since it's never up to our standards; however, he said we would be back to Origin India very soon! Kudos to Chef Kuldeep Singh!"
ST2KQ01_Maty9Ry-Rq2DsQ,5,"Got Memories did a fantastic job transferring my family's old home movies to DVD.  Their prices were comparable and, best of all, I did not have to mail my precious memories and worry they would be lost.  They communicated well throughout the process.  I can now view my home movies anytime I want and see my mother and father and other family members who have passed on.  A+ Work! Highly recommend!"
wsyIF-D3hDTaJ7VfEUkNJg,1,"I give this place negative 5 stars. They are awful & dishonest. The Fleet Manager lied through his teeth to get me to come in...and I fell for it. They will lie, lie, lie over the phone to get you to come in and then 5 minutes into of being at the dealership, they will tell you the truth. Don't believe any of the prices they have on their website, they are lies. Save your time and go elsewhere."

17onQY3Zkr_Nbp3bOwY_-A,5,"Absolutely, positively our new favorite restaurant!  Executive chef and owner Jose Leyva is a master at creating amazing flavors in his kitchen.  Last night was our third dining experience at Blue Adobe SFG over the past few weeks and there are still menu items we want to try.

First, the salsa that comes with the complimentary chips and salsa is the best we've ever had.  Thick, rich and perfectly seasoned...a great way to tantalize your taste buds for the entree to follow.  Then we had to share a bowl of their award-winning chicken corn chowder, which we find ourselves addicted to.  Don't sleep on that appetizer - it's simply delicious.

Then the entrees - this time I tried the SW Chicken Pasta, one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had anywhere.  Since the dish is made to order, I ordered it without beans and without tomatoes, and it was beautifully presented and SO GOOD.  My wife had the Taco Tuesday special with a crab cake taco and a guacamole taco, which she loved equally.

Our server, Lauren, highly recommended the fish and chips special on Friday nights so we hope to see you there!  FYI, the restaurant is a little hard to find on the NE corner of Lindsay & Williams Field roads - behind a Walgreens store.  It's casual but upscale and the food prep and presentations are worthy of fine dining."

8RkUQC5pdl6inSEe9dcO3w,1,"I have long debated on how to write this review for Beteena because all of her other reviews are so good. I went to Beteena BECAUSE of all of the amazing reviews I found online. However, my experience could not have been further from what other women experienced and I felt it was important to write an honest review.

My wedding was Oct. 19th and I took my dress to Beteena mid August. At my first meeting with her, after she stared me up and down for a few minutes she said to me, ""You need to lose 5 pounds, 8 would be better."" (as an aside, I am a usual size 8-10 and my wedding dress was a size 16). She also went on to tell me that the material of my dress was practically impossible to work on and asked me how much it was because she also took that into consideration when deciding her pricing. In addition to losing weight she told me that ""it was such a shame that I spent so much money on a dress that didn't have the seams tacked down and wasn't complete"", (side note - the dress was finished and didn't have the seams tacked down intentionally). After her assessment, she told me she was going to have to take the straps in, create the bustle, and hem it - all for $750. Not really knowing what seamstresses usually charge, I assumed that was normal. Price aside, I left her store in tears, feeling pretty shitty about my self and actually hating my dress because of what she said. Fast forward 5 weeks, I lose 10 pounds, and I am back at Beteena's store excited to see how the dress fits after following her instructions. I put on the dress and walk out to show Beteena and she says (in her extremely cold tone) ""Yes, looks much better, but it's still not right. Loosing weight didn't help much."" 

So she pinned the dress where it needed to be pinned - all the while complaining about the material and how hard it was going to be to sew and not sure if she could complete it. After she finished pinning, I walked into the dressing room to change. When I walked out Beteena comes back over and tells me that since there is SO much more work to be done since I lost weight (which she told me to do) the new cost to alter the dress was going to be $1,170. It is important to point out here that there is not a stitch of lace or one bead on my dress. I now have less than a month to my wedding and I start crying in the middle of her store and say, ""no, I am not paying that."" She then tries to explain why it costs so much and tells me that ""yes, I am much more expensive than everyone else because I pay such close attention to detail."" She then continues to tell me there was nothing that could be done based on the material of my dress and she wasn't even sure she would be able to complete it even if I did pay her and she wasn't sure if anyone would be able to alter the dress (not something you want to hear 3 weeks from your wedding after already spending $2000+ on a gown). 

I leave Beteena's store in tears for the second time, absolutely hating my dress and panicked. Which, yes, seems dramatic, but if you are planning a wedding you will understand why I was crying when you get to 3 weeks out. I start asking friends for recommendations for other seamstresses and someone gives me the name and number of Peggy. 

To wrap up this long review, I went to see Peggy (who laughed out loud when I told her what Beteena was charging me) and she saved my dress. I will forever be grateful to her. Peggy met with me three days after I left Beteena's store in tears. After I tried the dress on for her she said, ""Okay, this should be easy. I'll have it done in a week and it will be $125."" Peggy did a PERFECT job for $1,000+ less than what Beteena was going to charge. 

To say the least, my experience with Beteena was not great. To Beteena's credit, when I went to pick up my dress after I stormed out of her store in tears she did ask how she could have handled the situation better and was remorseful when I explained how offended I was by her and how terrible she made me feel. I do not think that Beteena is a bad person or a bad seamstress but I would not recommend her based on my experience."

BzjeIAOBhDgahJsiHqA_uw,3,"There aren't many dessert shops and chocolatiers in Markham/Scarborough area compared to downtown. For lava cakes and crepes, 0109 is one of the few that offers it in this area. I think 0109 is nice for desserts if you live in the area and you want a break from chinese desserts. However, if I lived in another city, I will not come to Markham/Scarborough area for cakes and crepes. 

I came here once when it was really new, it was really long ago. I still remember it was very dark and cozy. But I came back recently and the ambience changed. It is more bright now, looking more casual than before. 

Service: Service was great. Servers were attentive and brought water. It also wasn't very busy so it is easy for servers to keep an eye on all tables. 

Desserts: 

1) Matcha Lava Cake: I was excited to have this. I came on a chilly day and a lava cake was perfect to have on this chilly day. This was very disappointing. The cake was veryy DRY. It was like it was pre-made and then they warmed it up. I had a matcha lava cake before somewhere else at another dessert shop in uptown and it was delicious. But the one here was dry and it wasn't a nice cake in general. The cake also lacks in matcha flavor. I would rate this 2/5

2) Crepe: Lindt chocolate cake with added strawberries and bananas. Plus a scoop of cappuccino gelato. This was decent. I loved the gelato, it stood out from the crepe itself. It had a strong flavor and it was really creamy. I would rate this 3/5

Overall, I am not sure if I would come back for cakes/crepes. Nothing stood out to me to give me a reason to return."
XHKVbReIpXNzd19EG25d-w,4,"I really like the vibe this place has.
It FEELS elegant, luxurious, and modern. (It helps that it is a new venue; anyone remember the Boardwalk???)

The Casino is smallish, but they have one of the few single deck Blackjack tables on the strip (most are standard 8 deck). Won $140 for about 20 mins of playing @ a $10 minimum too! Not too shabby.

It also has fairly centralized location on the strip, so everything is pretty easy to get to from here.

I'll be making my reservations here next time I go to Vegas."
ZraD18L8EXNcqJvXfU8I_A,5,"Tried this place for the first time last night due to positive reviews on Yelp.  We weren't disappointed.

We ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken tikka.  We are those rare people who actually don't like spicy food but love Indian as long as it's cooked VERY Mild.  So I always order super, super mild.  It had no heat at all so he nailed it on the first attempt, which almost never happens for us.

The flavor was AMAZING.  The sauce had an incredibly fresh taste brimming with intense flavors and fresh herbs, so much so we couldn't get enough.  It's not exactly the taste I remember from our days in California but unlike other Indian restaurants that fall short at imitating the taste, this was just so amazingly unique in taste that I'd put it on par with the best I've had, just uniquely different.

Since our favorite Indian place in AZ closed (India's Grill), we've been disappointed over and over trying to find another place.  This will be our new favorite.

Just be aware, it's really only good for takeout.  As others noted, it's so tiny and not really outfitted for dine in.  Also, it's really hard to find because it's so tiny.  The storefront is only about 10 feet wide and it's tucked between a Chinese restaurant and a nail salon.  I drove by twice and didn't spot it; the owner had to talk me to it!

And as other's have noted, it's truly the owner and one other person cooking everything from scratch so it takes longer (over 45 minutes from the time I ordered).  But there's something really quaint about the whole experience; it's like you're visiting their home and they're whipping up some home cooking back in the kitchen.

Oh, and as noted, prices are very good.  Generally about 20% less than I'm accustomed to paying."
C4gWJB8pku37qTiDR6Z0jg,1,"These people butchered our poodle. If I could add a picture to show you how terrible she looks, you would think that these groomers had no formal education and I brought the dog to supercuts for $10 trim. 

We will be taking the poodle to another groomer to fix her haircut and for them to shave the spots that Hap E staff missed. 
The poor dog is sleeping underneath a pile of blankets because I'm sure it was a traumatic experience and she is exhausted. 

The Rottweiler that we brought was fine, because she just got a bath. Don't go here. If there was a zero star possibility, they would get it.

F rating and the business is run by a bunch of no-talent hacks."
cxpNGjJ-c-2SlZSK6lAvxw,1,"Worst Starbucks ever. Customer service is awful.  I ordered a half sweet pumpkin spice latte at the drive thru and left to drive to work, only to find that they gave me a stone cold full sweet pumpkin spice latte. This tells me that this Starbucks is serving paying customers old drinks that they didn't order and have probably been sitting on the counter waiting so that the Barista doesn't have to make another one, or the barista has no idea how to make a warm coffee. I tried calling in to speak to a manager and there was no manager even working that day. How does that happen? This place is unsupervised and selling $5 coffees to their customers that are absolute garbage. When I called to complain, the kid that answered the phone and said the manager wasn't in didn't even have the decency to offer to replace my coffee for the next time I was by. The manager at this location should be fired based on what I've seen from other reviews and first hand experience."

zsUVQl9OFUvSuByca3UBYA,4,"I would have to say that Aria is pretty cool. 

I like the architecture and modern feel. Everyone there was cool, helpful and professional but the only reason I had to give it four stars instead of five is because the bellman in the front blew it for everyone. 

I got dropped off by a cab and none of them even opened my door let alone helped me with my luggage. Even as I was walking up they continued their conversation as if I was not even there. And because I was wearing cute shoes all day my feet were killing me and I really could have used a hand. 

It really stinks they represented the hotel that way because honestly everything else was perfect. The girl that checked me in was super sweet. 

The room was awesome. I had a strip view that I enjoyed when I used my remote to open the curtains also had a nice king bed. The room was nicely appointed with a great bathroom and nice smelling citrus toiletries. 

The room also had a universal remote and in my case I was in town for business so every little thing to make your life easier is awesome. 

The next morning I ordered room service from my bedside iPad. Very cool and everything was just as I asked for down to the hazelnut creamer. 

I would definitely come back."

We also go to visit the Art Museum and see one of Monet's Waterlilies, which was breathtaking!!!"
EjCrmW1D4h_H0YAHZNvefQ,1,"Thank goodness I don't have a car anymore and don't have to deal with these clowns.

Back when I moved into PGH, I did have a car, and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood (N. Oakland).  Go figure, when I went to the office to do so, the meter I first tried to park at was broken, and wouldn't accept any of my quarters.  (This is back in the day when the old meters still existed.)  I should have recognized this as a metaphor for PPA's dysfunctionality.  As it were, I just reported it to them.

As anyone who's ever been to N. Oakland knows, parking there is a real PITA, and the street that my apt. bldg.'s on doesn't even have parking.  One day about two weeks later, after parking in one of my normal spots, I went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield.  ""What the heck?"" I thought, since I had my residential permit prominently displayed.  Turns out I was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk.  I wasn't aware this rule even existed, but apparently, it does.  Way to welcome me to the neighborhood, PGH!

Since I was new to town and I'd heard that PGH parking court is a joke, I decided to contest the ticket.  It took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date, since you couldn't schedule one yourself through their website.  I scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month later.

Before I was ever able to go to court, a flood happened and totaled my car, making me even angrier about the situation.  I went to court with the plan of asking for leniency, given that I was new to town and newly carless.  When it was my turn, I took one look at the judge (a portly and stern-looking elderly woman) and knew I wasn't going to get off.  I didn't even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off.  ""It isn't our fault you didn't know the rules and that your car's wrecked,"" she said.  Good thing I had enough cash on me to pay the fine, since I don't think they even took credit cards.

Don't believe the stories about PGH parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket, regardless of the reason for it.  That court is a kangaroo court and they're out to do one thing--make money.  Be aware of the more obscure laws, which include not only parking too close to crosswalks, but also head-in parking only.  Check the parking signs carefully, feed the meters, and observe the time limits, and hopefully, you won't have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots.  You've been warned.

I won't even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in Oakland...  Their slogan, ""The Value Parking Network,"" is laughable and downright disingenuous."
ZrvsD7PSyPolII3gp4-uHw,5,"As a vegetarian, it can difficult to find places with good options, but I love getting a tofu bowl at Pei Wei. The first time I had it, I had to double check because it looks and has a similar texture to meat, but it's great. I love going to Pei Wei"

GjKRcNiZIViCC0hozTaJEw,4,"My friend works at Lavo and the company that owns them was having a soft opening of Marquee Dayclub, and employees were invited as well as family and friends. (I think that's what it was). When we arrived it was packed! It started at 2pm and we got there around 3:20. We walked around for a bit, stopped at the bar with our 2 tickets for free drinks. I had a margarita and she had a lemon and vodka type drink.  

Then we got SO lucky! She found someone she knew who escorted us to a table under the tent. Someone else came over and asked what we'd like to eat. They sent over a tray of fresh  fruit while we were ordering food and drinks. ( I really like it when I'm treated like a high-roller). They offered us a bottle, but I was driving and going to Embers that night, I only wanted a mojito. My friend wanted one too so they send over a carafe of mojito's. 

For food we had:  Ahi tuna over salad. The salad had cold blanched snow peas. WOW, insanely delicious. Next time I see them, I'm buying them and putting them in salads. WOOOOOW.
There were cherry tomatoes, avocado and artichokes in the salad too. The dressing was very good as well. We also had the fish tacos'. They were delicious too. We had a side of fries to and they were nicely seasoned. 

For drink: Margarita and mojito. The mojito was definitely better than the 'rita. I dont like the fake syrupy stuff. They didn't use fresh squeezed (key ingredient!) lime juice. Cheap tequila. No Grand Marnier floater like a really good 'rita has. The mojitio was better, and it did have fresh mint, but it was only OK. I guess we should have gotten the bottle!

The Scene: lots of scantily clad early 20's pretty girls taking orders and bringing drinks. They have male runners bring the food. Lots of people, in their mid 20's to early 30's drinking. A LOT. Since most of these are friends and family and employee's I'm sure this was toned down. A DJ playing good music. A table full of good food and drink. Me likey!

I wish we would have gotten there a little sooner and wish I could have stayed a little later. It was cool. DJ playing music, tons and tons of people walking around drinking. On one hand I did feel a little old, on the other, if I didnt work that day and have to work the next, I'd probably be, no, I *would* be one of the tons of drunk people. Instead, I went to Embers and had a FANTASTIC time at the elite event. 

I wish I could say I'd come back here. But I wont. Why? It's crazy expensive. We didn't pay to get in, or for the 1 free drink we each got. BUT the high roller cool sh*t we got came with a ""bill"" but it was ""comped"". For ONE carafe of mojito, 1 ahi tuna salad, 1 side of fries and 1 order of fish taco's the bill came to $149.00! They was no table charge, and I dont think I saw a fruit platter charge, and we didn't pay to get in OR those drinks, so, this would have been, what, a $300+ day if we had truly paid for each and every thing. Getting all that stuff was great, I loved it, and I'm thankful for it. I just would not spend my own money on that. If you have tons and tons of cash to spend on something like this, then you'd probably love it."

Had the Chipotle Philly--yummy! Cheesey and meaty, included onions and peppers. There was another option with jalapenos and shrooms that sounded pretty good too. Choice of wheat or white bread and they slice the meat right there.
Since it was a hot sub, I ended up waiting about 5-10 minutes from when I paid. 
Here's why I thank the coupon--$7 for the sammich! Not the meal, just the sammy. I understand that not everywhere has a $5 footlong, but for the meal, you're approaching $9/$10. Seems kinda steep for a sammich, a bag o chips, and a drink. But, there were numerous people in there, so maybe that's just me. 
Employees: a couple of them were really nice (and apologized for the wait), one of them not so much. Kinda made me feel like I had to apologize for coming in and that it was a pain to ring up my order. Same goes with customers, but they don't have any control over those..."
V4MHgEfzOkgK5uHlAzGC_A,4,"Great variety of different smoothies and they taste great! No complaints there. Nice friendly employees too! The only downfall is the very expensive prices! They lose stars because the prices are not slightly high, but significantly high. Sorry....$8.00 bucks for a smoothie is extortion!! Lol."
l8DvvdxYwqjcebEXukeEMg,3,"Good Chinese food for Cheap Price. I went in with 2 other colleagues .
Service is good. 
Good Portions.
Quick Service.
Doesnt take American Express.
Probably i will go there once every two months, because there are so many restaurants in town which serve similar kind of chinese food for the same price. so nothing special hence giving 3 stars."
AV3KH4HwFDbgFRdVsSygMQ,5,"Ordered the Siete Mares and it is out of sight!  If I were ordering this anywhere in Scottsdale it would have cost triple what they charge.  5 blue mussels, 5 clams, several large shrimp.  Spicy, served on a bed of angel hair pasta with Texas toast to die for.  Oh, and did I mention their  beer menu is awesome..."
1HKDug8snqOKE7DrihV-2w,4,"There's a lot of pho places and so I find it hard to pick a favourite because so many broths are so good in their unique way.

Hanoi is a perfect example of a differentiated top performer.  Their soup was very pleasant and flavourful yet light and not too salty, and they use a more transparent noodle version which is different to the typical pho places.  It was a very pleasant light meal.  

Only thing is they come in 1 size only, so you can't pick an XL for the starving boys.

Also, I wasn't as impressed with the sides I ordered...when I go to a restaurant and order mussels i would be expecting fresh muscles, not those big one shell packaged mussels.  (even though I have to admit it was cooked in a nice way)

Service was very nice and quick (but maybe because there wasn't anyone else to serve lol..)

HOWEVER, I still have to give a 5 star, because I honestly really liked that pho.......good job Hanoi 3 Seasons!"
vOndr3nLYsA_LUxE0MMq9A,4,"I loved my experience with them. Had problem at check in and they quickly sorted it out, very professional and welcoming environment. The buffet was nice but overpriced . I wish they would give us $20 gambling card instead of $20 food/ restaurant  card that we didn't use ( it's expensive and even with $20 off we can spend so much money ). Oh and there was a terrible noise coming from windows, car race place right across the street, they didn't stop till late. Otherwise, a nice and comfortable place to stay"
PDxhn6LvIeEts-r-_9uzqQ,1,Just had he most horrible experience... I am handicap when I went to pay for my gas I realized I did not know the pump I was at so I asked if by chance they new the pump number right in front of the door... She said no the window is tinted .. So they made me limp back out to see the pump number ... I am sure they knew the number they were just hateful !!!
8I8FrCaL9wY768xhdH4EKQ,1,"Menu is wonderful.  Food is great.  Service is awful.  If you observe you will notice people my age are not dining there.  It seems to be more for the drinkers that could care less when their food comes.  I have attempted three times and all three times it is the same old same old.  Empty tables and the kitchen can't handle it.  This is ok once in a while, but every time?! 
So, if you are wanting to try out this fabulous menu before or after a play or movie...be prepared to wait over 45 minutes for your food.  So sad.  So disappointing.  ""Mikey"" right in my face told me he basically could care less if I ever come back.  This was his attitude when I asked him what was going on with the food taking so long.  Supposedly he is the manager.  So unprofessional.  49 minutes to get our food.  I was warned up to 30 but 49 was just not right and what was even more wrong was ""mikey""!"
Pg6PzjrZw_XlUyYL3fVT6g,1,"The only good thing about this place was the waitress we had. The rest was brutal. The ""chef"", and I will use that term lightly, was apparently having a bad day because he was slammed. 25 people for a capacity of 280 is not slammed. Brutal. The first addition of our order for 4 came out wrong, the second was inedible. The burgers were burnt to hell and could have been used for tomorrow's hockey game. Don't go here..."
TPWoRzID8HmU3p4IEVoRCA,4,"I've been eyeing this place for a long, long time. The husband and I decided to give it a try after a movie date, and ordered takeout. 

They were very kind, offering us water while we waited. The restrooms are clean, although I didn't notice any changing tables for babies. 

We ordered the chicken shawarma plate, falafels and baba ganouj. The chicken was perfection, with a delicious garlic sauce (super potent! Not first date friendly, but fine for us old married people ). The falafels were donut shaped, which was new to me. They were good, but I wanted some kind of sauce with them or something. The baba ganouj was ok, it could have used maybe a tad more salt? 

Food is a bit on the pricier side ($12+) for entrees, and I think $6 something for the dips. Bc of the proximity to my parents house, we will prob eat here again, but not on the regular."

jTurOIN1grHqCB6QriAYPw,4,I'm going to start off by saying that I F'ing LOVE Margaritas. So naturally I love coming here every time I'm in Vegas. The Margaritas were delicious and the selection is pretty darn massive. I like to come here and chill out to get away for the shoulder to shoulder crowds and throw down some delicious Tequila. Side Note: While ordering my margarita at the bar some older man pulled out an 8 Ball of Cocaine and proceeded to cut it up on the bar WAHAHAHAHAH F'ing Vegas.
Kzu3nM9cE44auY9zHnTDaw,3,"I went through the Drive-Thru here. The food was good and reasonably priced, but they had one person working the inside and drive thru! If you're busy, hire more people so that the staff doesn't have to rush back and forth!

Edited 4/2014: their Greek salad with gyro meat is delish!"
Y3GcUp3YjRZBz3xjqYOCqg,2,"Read the good reviews on yelp and decided to try it out on a Sunday afternoon. The service was very lacking but it looked like they were short staffed. The food though was pretty uneventful. I had the Chicken Limone and my boyfriend had the Creamy Garlic Chicken. There was nothing going on with the food. No seasoning, no anything. Everything was very bland. Looked like it had been sitting in the back a while before the servers got it out to us. The appetizer we had (firecracker rolls) were lukewarm. Was so excited to try and sorely disappointed."
8BZyveAZNs0aAdRHm9bmtA,5,We just moved here from TX but we grew up in TN. So we were looking for some PIG (hard to get anything but beef in TX). I read the other reviews posted here & decided to give it a try. GREAT!!! We went to the Sunday buffet and it was so good. Can't wait to go back again. YUM!!! Enjoyed the chicken & the pork. I haven't acquired a taste for the NC red slaw but enjoyed the mac n cheese. And the nanner pudding!
ERP9r3LsZ0dRkTpzss9Vgw,5,This is one of my favourite Asian restaurants. All dishes are very flavourful and have a home made quality to them. Try anything I have yet to be disappointed.

uMQvvm3WUM419GYToMZkAQ,5,"Save your money/ financial aid. This was a waste of 3 months and a $3,000 drop fee. I switched from Avalon to Aveda Institute Phoenix because I didn't feel that I was learning shit. Literally I was scared to blowdry. The kit, the staff, everything was shit. There were two cool teachers. That's it. Save your money and go to Aveda. They work with you until you get it right. You're paying 20k which is a thousand more than Avalon but for the learning and experience I'm more than willing. They actually have state board training during the final phase and master series (classes) from barbers to color and cut specialists and so much more from Hattori Hanzo and the Aveda Network. Even people who have just heard about Aveda products want to come in and see what we're about from all over the the country. If you know what's good for you and a career in the beauty industry instead of working at great clips or cost cutters of that sort, go to Aveda. I'm months away from graduating and becoming a proud Aveda alumni and that's all thanks to Avalon. Oh yeah and I have a job with Dolce Salon and Spa already"
_9wvusv9ddZAO3xQkY40KQ,4,"I've been a number of times to Red Embers and have never had a bad visit. The service is always friendly and prompt though I will admit, it's a bit less prompt at lunchtime which appears to be the time of day when they are training newbies. 

I've had a wide variety of menu items and while none have disappointed, my favorites are the chicken pesto flatbread and the veggie tacos. 

Look forward to future visits!"

DecoKYoCKhS_XEGhL6cGpg,5,"This is the best buffet in vegas! It's pretty awesome that quantity does not lower the quality! 

I usually go around dinner time because they have a better seafood selection :) I get the crab legs warmed and sprinkle lemon on it! Yum! Also, their oysters taste on the fresher side. 

Also, they have a good selection of mexican and asian. Don't forget to get their horchata! It's delicious. 

My favorite part of this buffet is their dessert selection.  They have macarons, crepes, pie...anything you can imagine. 

I spend a good 2 hours in the buffet and by the end of my meal, my pants get A LOT tighter. 

Tip: What I like to do is get the 24 hour band and when you get to the bacchanal you just pay an extra 15-25 dollars or so depending on whether it's lunch or dinner."

I enjoyed their poutine."
5fmjMhnmQdp1zPqnFqsUdg,4,"Went here tonight with my wife. The  décor is cool, the service is first rate and the tacos are delicious. The street food size portions are fine, but the guys might wish the tacos were a little bit larger. The taste is excellent. They have chips and a really nice salsa waiting for you when you get to your table. Nice idea. I had the shrimp taco and the carne asada taco and the crispy fish taco. All of them were great. I liked the crispy fish the best. My wife loved the margaritas. Our waiter Justin did an outstanding job. The wait staff, are everywhere and they didn't miss a beat when we were there.   Make the tacos a little bit bigger and this place is a definite 5 star all day long. We will definitely be back."
ycmNo1MKzanEDRn_QEe4oQ,4,"In fact, I rather like the staff here. I say hello to them every time, and they smile and say hello back. I'm a person who asks for a lot of lettuce or whatever, and I've never had a problem getting that here. 

Apparently, it's a union shop here, which is nice. (Go unions!) Apparently, it means they can give you more cheese than the average Subway?

Real good for a Subway. Unfortunately, I eat here more than I'd like to."
tmNpULpGH-G19viXToXXtg,5,"Went there for their Thanksgiving meal and it was so good that we went back to try the regular dishes. The beef brisket is tasty, the biscuits melt in your mouth, the ribs are awesome. The service is really good. Pricey."
hQhKIXjXckjbyqliURyBog,4,"Whenever my mom and I go to Vegas, we always go to the 777 Restaurant for dinner since the Market Street Cafe (at the California) usually has a long line.  During this trip, we visited the restaurant twice.  

With the first visit, we ordered burgers (mom got the cheeseburger and I got the mushroom burger).  She opted for sweet potato fries and I got regular fries.  The burgers came out quickly and they were cooked the way we wanted.  Nothing too spectacular...

But on the second visit, we ordered their BBQ chicken pizza and an order of potstickers.  The potstickers were okay and came with a tasty sauce.  The pizza was awesome!  It was a bit bigger than one from CPK and was enough for the two of us to share.  There was just the right amount of chicken, onions, and barbecue sauce on each piece.  

The atmosphere is somewhat noisy and it was hard to have a real conversation without yelling across the table.  There are various sports shows going on around the bar.  

I know that we'll return the next time we come to Vegas.  I'll just order another pizza to try."

Just the right amount of crowded, outstanding service by everyone I encountered, and I didn't feel like I was constantly being ripped off like most other strip places. Played volleyball at the pool, ate at Roxy's (2x) and McCall's Heartland Grill...both had gluten free options for the wife too. Saw the Frankie Moreno show for free, which was one of the best show's I've seen. Lots of bars, restaurants, and stuff to do. Also the area outside the hotel was fine during the day, and will probably continue to get better when SLS and Walgreens opens.

Strat has won a spot in my hotel rotation."
WgagxaZDMqsY-Cqs5cUuTw,4,"This place is where I go for a decent breakfast. Everything tastes great and the service is excellent and pretty fast everytime. The only thing they could improve on really is portions and to be a little more careful of their cutlery in terms of cleaning. Im pretty picky when it comes to cutlery tho, I cant stand even seeing water stains on my fork."
6FPSR-sri_hRmgcB_EXGbQ,5,"They fixed my laptop when another place couldn't. My laptop screen stopped working. The UBreak IFix place on McKnight admitted they didn't know what was wrong but an hour later told me my motherboard was dead and the only thing they could do was rescue my hard drive. I wanted a second opinion, so I took it to Aquilis on 2/22. They connected my laptop to an external monitor which showed my computer functioning just fine minus the broken screen. They ordered a new screen, which didn't fix the issue so they kept trying - new screens, new wires, etc. Then they ordered a new motherboard which finally fixed the problem. They kept trying possible solutions and called me with updates where the other place gave up. They called 4/9 to tell me my laptop is ready for pick up. It took so long to fix because they had to order parts, which shipped from China as well as troubleshooting the actual problem."
Fe5SVwBpdbcYgFoUZhr0nw,1,"I can't find full breakfast menu online so I don't know the name of the breakfast burrito I ordered. Well I have lived in 10 states and 3 Countries and the breakfast burrito I ordered was the worst breakfast item I have ever had. Suppose to be spicy, I guess when they pour a bottle of some kind of spice on it they think it's spicy. Yes it was big and full of potatoes and potatoes and more potatoes, the egg was at one end with little cheese. First 1/3 of burrito was potatoes no egg no cheese. Other breakfast items are good but waitress and menu hiped up burrito which SUCKED."

mJXHjSvLZVz0OXwHb9U8Ig,3,"Ivory Room is definitely a good time, but there's always a $5 cover (like others have mentioned, you can grab a drink at Capital Tap Haus first and get a voucher for free entry), and sometimes there is a wait, too (even when it doesn't look that crowded). I also don't love that there's not much room to dance, because most of the bar is filled with seats, and it's hard to weave through people and tables. Also, it's not something you can do every weekend... they play a lot of the same songs."

7ykqNP8vX2Oq5adJAD5EkA,4,"My friend and I went to China Magic Noodle after buying the Groupon deal. The place was nice with plenty of tables and the service was prompt. Our waiter was very helpful in picking out the right dishes for each of us. 

We started with the Spring Rolls which, oddly enough, came out after our entrees. The Spring Rolls were a bit of a disappointment... a bit too greasy and kind of plain in taste. 

I got the Fried Noodles with Beef and my friend got the Friend Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. We each went home with a to-go box of over half of the dish left. The noodles were good - I had never tried hand-made noodles before and was pleasantly surprised. 

I also tried the Honey Peach drink. This was very good if a bit sweet. I will definitely try another flavor next time since they have 5+ flavors to choose from. 

Note: China Noodle does accept credit cards, but they prefer cash.

We'll be back!"

Thank you for the great service and great food! Will come back for sure."
TXEYwr3dzzbEuzIZO6v8SA,5,"Dealing with Movin Murdy was wonderful every step of the way.  
They came out for an estimate the day we called for information and were honest and open about various charges and how we could potentially save money.  
The day of the move we had a window of arrival between 8-8:30.   They arrived by 7:45 and got to work right away.  Blankets and protective material were laid throughout the apartment to keep everything clean.  After a quick walk through, they made a plan for packing and loading and got to work.
The guys were extremely friendly.  They were even kind to our cat.  She was scared and had been hiding under the bed.  One of them came out holding her and petting her trying to calm her down.  It was so sweet!
The move into our house went equally as smooth.  They were very careful in placement of furniture and even suggested how to secure cabinets to the walls (as they knew I have infant twins).
The job was done quickly and professionally and everything went off without a hitch.
One thing to note is that if you pay via credit card, there is a $25 fee.
If you are looking for professional and expedient movers, these are your guys."

xbjVldkoUVyYuvuoA8idqQ,3,"This place was a pretty typical market in a very cool building.  Mostly meats, fruits and veggies.  A few unique vendors but was only passing through so wasn't really shopping.  Did try a smoked sausage sandwich from Franks which was good.  Also bought some bacon jerky from one of the vendors - it was good but some cuts were basically all fat (I would recommend asking specifically).

If I were staying in Cleveland longer, this place would definitely be a stop for some fresh items."
H_uslGH_o7_d_Jmui3awVg,4,we went to rio and stayed there in march the hotels were a good size and fairly clean and a very good price. their seafood buffet was great ! the problem was the valet put a good size smudge on the bumper of the car .it took the valet a while to bring the car up . we did not make a big deal about it at the time seeing that it was a rental and we bought full coverage for the car. it had one of those rear view screens . maybe that was what confused the valet so be careful if you valet there.
qNkcvDOpZEsPDcP28Zet8g,5,"One of the best Buffet experiences available. This place blurs the line between fine dining and buffet. Firstly, the food is hot, flavorful, and plentiful. Food options are many and luxurious. Love the variety of Asian, cheeses, Italian, seafood and other cuisines. The desserts are fun too, there's even a crepe station! Would definitely recommend for a culinary experience, make sure to come hungry!"

x6jJj0guXnLt0xZkPwO8RA,5,"Terrific restaurant. Family owned and run by various members of the family. Dad wears the chef hat and his kids take care of the tables. We should all make an effort to support local business such as this, but this place makes it a complete joy to do so- full tummies and all. 

On a recent visit to my home town, we hosted my mothers birthday dinner here. The food was so good we came back again before we left town. You simply can't go wrong here. The entire table loved their mains, everything  from the Lamb chops to the Lasagna. You do have to come with some patience but trust me when I say it pays off- as the head Chef (Dad) plates up every dish himself and makes sure it's noting short of perfect. Two of our guests ordered the Lamb Chops which came out cooked to perfection, literally. Not undercooked or overcooked, just cooked perfectly- which by the way even the best of restaurants can't seem to nail. The rest of us carb loving people ordered pasta and weren't at all disappointed. If my husbands comment doesn't put it in perspective, I don't know what does- ""I love you and your lasagna but this is the best lasagna I've ever had."" Promptly followed by a kiss of course, soften the blow. But I don't mind, because on our second trip back to this gem, I order d the lasagna and he was right! So good. I need to up my lasagna game. 

As for Wine, they have a good selection. They carry genuine Chianti from Italy. Which is impressive. To be a genuine chianti it has to the have the black Rooster label and a serial number as this specific type of wine is governed by the Italian government. If you ever have a bottle of Chianti without these two distinguishing marks- it's not legit. I learnt all of this during a trip to Italy last year, and legit chianti is truly delicious. 


Bottomline, this is the place to go for a traditional Italian experience- from the wine to the food. Reservations recommended."
UgoGWR_Ay73Uoffb-sB_jQ,5,I have to give my brother five stars for always being the best barber in town. He always get my cut right and offers suggestions when I want to go way out there with something that might not quite work for me. His prices are reasonable and the shop is in a good location. I've been going here a long time and so have many others. It's like family time in the shop sometimes because of the people that have trusted Styles with their hair for years. He also does ladies hair too. I've seen his work and it's awesome. Im happy to be the first to leave a review. Check out Styles upon Styles for the latest cuts and styles.

He was also very informative. We'll definitely use this service again!"
gQZAmO59ZMVyEC0XOJ57rg,3,"This was a surprisingly cool place in an ethnic-retro sort of way. I've driven past there a million times en route to the Beachland, always slowing down before realizing that it was not, in fact, the Beachland.

I went to a wedding party there.  The food was good, the service was friendly and the atmosphere reminded me of those old-timey places that my grandparents used to go for their friends anniversary parties.

THE FOOD:  Skin-on mashed potatoes, pork chops, stuffed cabbage, (all good) garlicy and and inconsitantly cooked green beans.  The stand out was the table full of old-fashioned ethnic cookies-- nut rolls and the like.  It really brought me back.   

THE SERVICE:  Cute old Slovenian ladies and a gentleman.  All polite and sweet, just as you'd expect.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Sort of like the Beachland, except  better maintained.  Odd bas relief frescoes of happy Slovenians, a stage with a prosenium, old man bar at the side.  

It's a fun place for a laid back event."
HGrAtp9Lt_utIi-oi1cR_w,1,"First let me say that the food is really good, BUT, service stinks !  Waitstaff is rushed and unfriendly, food took forever to get to our table after waiting 15 minutes for a waitress to take our order.  Then another 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Then another 20 minutes for food.  Then to top it off they double charged our bank card and don't really seem to care.  We called and they said we have to wait till they cash out the register at 5 PM for them to check it.  We gave them all our information and they hung up before we were able to give our phone number for them to call us back. This was our third and last time to eat there and we will never call for deliver again either."
vYGp200AwjJppsY-l8fJzQ,4,"Two great courses, very good greens, most always in great shape, good pace of play, great practice area. Views are beautiful. The grill is good and fairly priced for this area. 
Saguaro sand traps were re-done over the summer and are good now. 
I do agree with Tom P, a few of the bag guys are more concerned with a tip and act like it when you don't need your clubs wiped off.
It's not Grey Hawk style where everyone treats you like your a member of their club."
u3f35G6aOeCdnFTA7J5ZxQ,4,"This restaurant deserves a little better than the two and a half star rating it has. 

I came here for pizza and some beers and had a good experience. They have a really good beer list with a variety of out-of-the-way craft beers that I have never heard of, but that were really excellent. I had a couple of different beers that I really enjoyed. Prices, though, are a little on the high side but probably justified by the quality. 

I also had a small pizza with hot Italian sausage topping. The pizza was $8.99 plus $1.79 for the topping. The crust was on the soft side and sauce and cheese on the pizza were fine. I would have this pizza again. 

They have a very pleasant bar in the back with around 12 or so bar stools. It was nice and comfortable to sit there and service was good at the bar. I'd visit again, especially for their happy hour specials."
jDdfJ2nLq90hxsQLFBnCwg,3,"Update for earlier review:    They have since changed the El Toro Grande Burrito entree.  The meal traditionally includes a fairly sized burrito, corn chips, grilled veggies, guacamole, and salsa.   This is for the whopping price of $15!  Now, they cut the veggies and substituted them with lettuce.  Literally pieces of lettuce. In addition, they removed the guacamole and and salsa. But the funny thing is they didn't lower the price at all.  And the menu didn't display any of these changes.  I think they instituted these changes to save money and inventory, but it was a poor choice.  

P.S. Make the cauliflower bites larger or add more!  Veggie Grill in California gives you huge cauliflower bites for a dollar less!  We love your food but sometimes the portions are small for the price.  Much love"
Z0nVguvSD7Zv3vbkOhEBTg,5,"This is by far THE best! I lived in Tremont for nearly two years, and I never had a bad tasting pizza or piece of tiramisu! Don't limit yourself to pizza! Try anything and everything on the menu! The staff is so friendly, and now, living in Kentucky, I can't find anything like Crust!!!"
ImLwh0H_tlY3ItcnazUb9A,3,"Wanted to grab a bite and some drinks while watching the eagles/redskins game. The lodge was close so we went here. First impression was good. We were greeted by our bartender Chris and asked what we were having and if we were hungry. Chris introduced himself and his partner behind the bar Mitch. Drinks came, food came, good night right? This changed as we waited 25 minutes for a another drink. I had two drinks over the course of three quarters of football and had to ask for the second. The bar wasn't packed at all and yet it seemed tasking to get a drink. This was until we had no plates, no drinks and were waiting for our friend to finish his 3rd beer, which he had excellent service throughout the night. Not saying Mitch and Chris are bad bartenders, everyone has an off night. Just concerning as we were told this place was good to go. The highlight of the evening was our ""chef"" who kept checking on us and had a great personable interaction with us all night."
_1zrFL4N4n91VBNB-PoNKQ,4,"Venimos a probar sólo los crawfish, Pedimos el sabor Hot & juice realmente era muy bueno, picoso pero el sabor hace que quieres mas. (Recomiendo el crawfish congelado ya que por libra cuesta menos $8.99 la libra aproximadamente, ya que el fresco estaba como a $12.99 la libra ( aún así sólo había congelado )Nuestra mesera fue muy amable. El lugar estaba lleno,"
oxgymhi8g_dXHVw29LXrtg,2,"Went here for a weekday lunch with my wife.  Service was ok, nothing special.  Nice enough waiter, but nothing memorable, service on this slow side.

Food was fairly unremarkable as well.  I had a salad and a roasted chicken dish - fairly forgettable. 

Interiors were on the nicer side, and lunch was fairly empty, so restaurant felt kind of cavernous, as it is somewhat large and needs a crowd to fill it.

Nothing great or terrible - I found it to be slightly below average for food and service, probably a little nicer than average for decor."
zfuvudfLXoQULRBpx7ulNA,5,I love this place. Some auto repair shops see $$$ when they see a female coming in. These guys have always been fair. I highly recommend this location.
8JQQcrGq8wDIwFUm6Vt6Ug,5,"This is definitely going to be my go to Indian restaurant in town. I had been wanting to go here for a while and we finally got a chance to go last night. We were seated quickly since it was just the 2 of us and it was pretty busy. Every table was occupied. 

They have lots of servers, so we were given water and menus promptly. There are so many dishes to choose from. My fiance got the garlic chicken masala with naan. I got the Kohinoor lamb aloo gosht with the basmati rice. We also ordered the paneer kulcha. The paneer kulcha was ok. I'm still trying to find my favorite flavor in the different breads they do. Our main dishes were good and not too spicy. Although, I love spicy food. The naan is huge! My fiance ate all of his garlic chicken and naan and he was so full. I couldn't even finish my rice, but I ate all the lamb aloo gosht and the paneer with it. 

Everything was yummy and we left full for under $40 with the tip. We will be back."
QWfWy8GvNCaABtRZyNMapw,5,"Great service from both Dr. Peguese and the optician Mike.  I like the selection of frames and the different options provided for the lenses.  I purchased a pair of progressive lenses and they turned out fabulously.  I can see clear far, near, and mid-distance and no longer have to keep taking my readers on and off multiple times per day.  The whole office is very customer-centric and they make you feel comfortable.  Everyone in the office seems happy so that tells you that it's a good company."
g_0d5jsQZTG9xYmKDXbJlw,2,"Upstream has gone downhill, fast. While the bar ambience and feel is still awesome, the sushi in particular was extremely lacking. Spicy Tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish. California rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland. 

Service was also not particularly good and there was a very creepy manager who put us off. 

It is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days. I cannot comment on the main courses as we did not have any."
OBX1W8dFs6h66z9Z9k_Waw,5,So authentic. Just like they make in Tokyo. Love this spot and it's conveniently open late!
E_RcxKF9wOQVzvgkwQq5zg,4,"I like this place, They play good music, its pretty clean and nice inside, the staff has been cool and drinks are good. If it wasn't so pricey we would come more often."
9uK_oWZ2EpGQf6uwS8NJ2g,1,"I love Giada and have been looking forward to having dinner here. 

Big disappointment. Firstly, we were seated in a booth area that held 3 tables for two people each. Unappetizing when the other tables had to get up and we had a great view of their bums. Tables were way too close. Very uncomfortable being so close to other tables. 

Once I told the waiter we didn't need the wine list he didn't even offer us a drink from the bar. We had to ask. BTW, the drinks are way over priced even for Vegas. 

I had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp and could not eat the shrimp as they tasted off.  Best part if the meal was the bread course. 

I will not be going back...sorry Giada expected more from you."
W7fTJJjw_s3tX4VE3aEhnw,2,"Closed by the health department... take a look at dirty dining. Sad that had to happen, not surprised when I was there things where a bit sticky. Not sure I can go back.. they keep taking my review down. I have. 

Now I'm getting flack on my review because they couldn't keep the place clean...lol 

Like I have control over how they choose to run there business"
CUskL4j-JD748hcNGaA31Q,5,"This was our first visit and am so glad we read about it on yelp!  The service was incredible, the food absolutely delicious,and the ambience was festive. Great food at a great price!  Will be one of our favorite places to go!"
74r6a8uWKEMPbASc4wW9fw,2,"I've gone here for years, but not anymore. I pulled in and my car had been rained on, hadn't been washed in awhile. I bought my wash at the gas pump hoping that this would prevent the increasingly pushy upselling. Not a chance. ""Are you wanting those mats steam-cleaned?"" ""No thank you, just a vacuum. I'm in a hurry."" ""What about a detail?"" ""No just the wash, thanks."" ""I could make you a deal for later, cuz you know you (sic) really needing one, right?"" ""Thanks, I have a detailer who's also a friend."" ""You better be calling your friend, then!"" I won't share what I said under my breath, but I'm sure you can imagine. As their final act of defiance, they left some easily vacuumable pieces on my driver's side mat. The guys at the front of the line should take a lesson from the guys at the end of the line - the finishers. They are awesome, hard-working, and humble. Sadly, too little, too late..."
tKE_Oj-wxstMDv14RGDnKQ,3,"I was incredibly excited to eat here during a recent trip to Las Vegas. We reserved a table for 4 at 7pm, and were seated promptly. The dining room is gorgeous. 

We were offered and ordered a pre-meal cocktail. 
At that time we met the staff and were asked if we had a show that evening. We said no, that dinner was the highlight of the evening. 

Shortly after we ordered our cocktails we placed our orders. I was a bit surprised they did not offer to explain anything on the menu; however we were discussing the Tasting Menu so I assume they knew we already wanted that. We placed our orders and before we could finish our cocktails the first course was at the table. The Sommelier arrived, who was funny and cordial, to describe the first wine. The first course was yellowtail, and delicious, my husband got the crab which was divine. As soon as we finished the food it was cleared and nearly as quickly they brought the glasses for the next course. Again, I was surprised because we all still had half our pre dinner cocktail and at least half of the first glass of wine. The second course came, amazing risotto, and the speediness repeatedly itself again. Finally, my husband asked them to slow down because the course were coming so fast we were barely able finish our previous course and unable to finish our drinks. The waiter apologized and mentioned they were used to getting people to shows. We stated again we didn't have a show. He said he would take cues from my husband. At this point, the service switched, the sommelier came out for 2nd wine, but not the 3rd and despite my husband trying to signal the waiter repeatedly it took 3-4 attempts (understandably he had other tables) to catch his attention so it took almost 3.5 more hours to complete our remaining courses. 

Overall the food was wonderful, I particularly loved my potato wrapped sea bass and soufflé, but the pace of service was stressful and detracted from the experience."
kFnrFF7zrtIxfYH27WW7AQ,5,"STK Las Vegas is definitely my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas so far.  Went for dinner and the ambiance is great.  There was a DJ playing a great set and it was classy and lively at the same time.  Service was quick and friendly.

I ordered the 20oz and it was cooked perfect with some horseradish on the side.  We ordered Mac and cheese, fries, and sauteed mushrooms (not on menu) as a sides.  

Con't be surprised with whatever amount comes out on the check, you're eating at a high end steak house and hopefully having a couple drinks as well.  I definitely recommend for a nicer dinner in Vegas."
RTYzYS2Z03lh1ZhQb7cZ3Q,5,"Great ambience any night with live music.  Did a large group on a Saturday when live Flamenco was in house.  Entire staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly including the chef and management. 

We did a large selection of tapas amongst 10 or so people and nearly everything was exceptional with nothing being below great.  Very authentic feeling and surely as close to a tapas meal in Spain itself as you will find in old town.  Highly recommended."
3IKkVauZRPPAk4YoGxUJmw,5,"One of my go to spots for lunch, best hot sandwich in town: There's a lot of ""sandwich shops"" out there, non come close to Romanelli's.

I've also catered food for parties and corporate events a handful of times. They've never disappointed, highly recommend this place"
0SXmkMLshfxF0KFIqEvQtg,5,My wife and I both bought e-bikes from Crazy Lenny's and we couldn't have had a better experience.  The sales staff was knowledgable and they let us try a number of models on the bike path located next to the store until we arrived at a bike that suited each of our individual needs.  I actually returned the first one I purchased and they allowed me to take another that was a better fit.  They had the best price in addition to the best buying experience.  Lenny checked in with us during our initial visit and actually handled the exchange for me.
CcO-Kr_lZSTRsmSG91RnIQ,1,"Not being a Torontonian, I had done a lot of research for a steakhouse for my boyfriend (BF)'s birthday. Reviews for Barbarians seemed good so I made a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday 3 weeks in advance. We showed up at exactly 8:30 with about 3 other couples arriving within 2 minutes of us. We were all told there was about a five minute wait and they gave us some bubbly wine to compensate. BF and I thought that was a nice touch since 5 minutes was not a long wait. 30 minutes later, one pair of couples were seated while the line up at the door continued to grow and we were anxiously, hungrily waiting for our table. The other two waiting couples were seated before us and then around 9:10 we were finally brought to our table by the manager who said ""I will take care of you to ensure a special evening"". We were brought to the worst table in the whole restaurant right in front of the kitchen where you can see and hear everything. We saw another table being cleared and asked to move. The waiter gave us attitude but allowed the change. Once seated we waited another 10 minutes for menus, water, bread and dill veggies. I was driving so I chose not to drink (also high wine prices). BF ordered a vodka (not premium) which we found out cost $13.00. We ordered our meal (shared ceaser salad, filet mignon & NY Sirloin. The salad came out on two plates but we were not offered some fresh pepper. It had a decent taste but was nothing special. About 10 minutes later the food came out (a bit quick for my liking being at a ""fancy"" steakhouse). Bf's steak tasted completely burnt with no flavor so we asked to send it back. Their excuse ""it's charred"". Our response, it's burnt. My steak was over cooked and had zero flavors. Disappointing. Tried to wait to eat with BF when his steak came out but it was taking twenty minutes. The baked potatoes (I asked if I could switch to mashed and was told ""no substitution) were cold and drenched in toppings. We asked for a bit of bacon and the cheese to add flavor but there was more of the toppings than there was potato. The second steak received was not much better than the first. Not once did anyone come to ask how the food was or if it was better. Halfway through the eating of the steaks I realized our water had also not been filled in at least 15 minutes. I kept trying to get a waiters attention but kept getting ignored to the point where I went to the bar to get my own water. We were so disappointed. I had also called the day before to remind them it is for a birthday for the gentleman I will be with. They did bring a ""cake"" at the end which ended up being the apple beignets. They basically throw it on the table and mutter happy birthday. They also gave it to me instead of my boyfriend even after clear instructions. The dessert was also disappointing as it was not a donut but an apple shaped as a donut with way too much cinnamon. The bill arrived without being asked if we wanted tea or coffee or anything else. I noticed that the steak was not removed from the bill which would have been a nice touch. Everything, including the dessert was charged which I was upset about especially after our horrible experience. The manager never came to see us or ask how the meal or evening was even though we noticed him schmoozing with other guests. We were certainly not ""taken care of"" as earlier told. At this point I decided to tell the manager about our experience. I started with ""I will be paying for this meal but this is what happened and why we had a negative experience"" and before he even let me continue he took the bill, said don't pay, don't come back and please leave. What terrible customer service. Not only will I never go back but I will make sure no one I know or ever speak to goes there either. The birthday meal was completely ruined. Other than the pickles we were utterly disappointed and have nothing positive to remember from Barberian's. For the price you are better off going to the Keg (less money, better service and way better food) or spending more and going to one of the nicer steakhouses like Ruth Chris, Morton's or Jacobs. Stay far away from Barberian's unless you want an evening of annoyances and disappointment."

uGMIWVPtYDzmMsL2fmXbXQ,5,"Found this tasty gem of a restaurant near our hotel. It is Japanese small plates which is great for sharing! Great vegetarian options and delicious choices for meat eaters as well. We tried the ramen, vegetable goyzas, scallion pancake, fried tofu in broth, pork short ribs, fried chicken and edamame. All delicious!!! Finished it off with a super yummy passion fruit cake. Great service, ambience and nice outdoor seating! Overall an excellent dining experience!"

wSI7X7qqMfDQxkNFHkOYwA,1,"Wow, this was genuinely terrible food. I ordered through Uber Eats as my boys have been going through a noodle phase and love everything noodles. I ordered the following as I thought they were pretty safe choices.
- Yaki Udon. Very salty with uneven cuts of veggies of which some were partially cooked and came sopping in a ""soup"" of sauce that filled a quarter of the container. Let me tell you, there is nothing worse than stir fried noodles where the noodles are drippy in pure soya sauce.
- Steak Teriyaki. Similar where the meat was very tough, the rice came overcooked and soggy and sopping in sauce and again, most of the veggies were unevenly chopped and were still raw.

Most of the food ended up being inedible - what a shame!"
DQjRGs939gBPqfoIqK7VYQ,1,Worst service ever! My clothes were tagged wrong and she charged me wrong! This was my first and last time..... the clerk and the environment was not welcoming with the prepaid only signs posted.
LleiJNhBSvjfwloSKd7xvA,5,"Love/love/love Tina for pink/white.  I recently moved to Vegas & have been to at least 5 salons looking for someone who can do acrylics that don't discolor, are thin, natural-looking & don't lift.   I've had so many bad  fills that I had nothing to lose trying Flamingo.  

Tina really took the time w/ my nails getting the old mis-shapen acrylic down & did a BEAUTIFUL job w/ the fill. They are very natural-looking (no funky humped up nail bed), nice & thin and the white is pure white. 

The salon isn't fancy & the day I was in there were only 2 techs working (Hannah & Tina) but those two were very busy & I STRONGLY recommend an appointment.  Over the hour & half I was there, they turned away 3 people because they were already booked past regular closing time (yes, they booked an appointment after hours so very customer-oriented). 

Prices are what I am used to from the east coast...$35 for a fill so not cheap like I think people expect due to the number of places around town, but not the crazy $55 I paid at another salon (check my reviews). 

I usually go 4-5 weeks between fills so I'll update on how well they do over time, but right now I am one HAPPY-HAPPY girl!"
